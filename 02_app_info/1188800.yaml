    review: "[i][u]In the Service of Mrs. Claus[/u][/i] is a short interactive novel\
      \ in which you play as a shapeshifting elf that\u2019s second in command and\
      \ somehow has all the qualifications to take on just about any job from checking\
      \ the naughty nice list to deactivating magical traps and even being the head\
      \ of security when push comes to shove! Basically, any rpg in which everyone\
      \ is completely useless but you and you feel the undying need to help every\
      \ single person that breaths!  \n\n[h1]Positives[/h1] \n\n[b][i]Gender choices:\
      \ [/i][/b] Fairly soon in to the story you are able to pick both the gender\
      \ and the pronouns that you would like the main character to take. Once you\
      \ have made your choice, you are unable to change them again throughout. Although\
      \ you play as a shapeshifter and become locked in to your decision, the initial\
      \ choice is welcome as I feel it caters to a larger audience.  \nAnother nice\
      \ touch is that you can pick the preferred gender of two of the love interests\
      \ while the third will always be a female. Again, this allows more readers to\
      \ select their personal preference and opens the market even further for the\
      \ consumers.  \n\n[b][i]Real choices:[/i][/b] Throughout the entire novel you\
      \ are given a variety of choices that will change the main characters personality\
      \ and skillset. You are free to play as a grumpy elf who dislikes other people,\
      \ an overly cheerful elf who adores everything Christmassy or anything in between.\
      \  \nAs for your skillset, there are several you may pick from such as Christmas\
      \ magic, shapeshifting, trickery and so on. It\u2019s advised to focus on just\
      \ one or two of these skills to level through answers as the higher the ability,\
      \ the more likely it will work as intended; However, it\u2019s never a requirement\
      \ as if your character fails a certain ability, someone else is usually there\
      \ to step in and take charge (and be angry that you suck). This does put a slight\
      \ dampen on the whole thing for me but it\u2019s nicer than getting premature\
      \ game overs and allows some RP. \n\n[b][i]This quote:[/i][/b] \"The tooth fairies\
      \ continue their raids for the disposable bones of mankind.\" \n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\
      \ \n\n[b][i]General errors: [/i][/b]As stated earlier, you are given the choice\
      \ to pick your gender early on, however, there are a few times in which I was\
      \ referred to as a \u201Che\u201D after playing as a she. I can\u2019t speak\
      \ for the reverse order as I didn\u2019t read through the story as a man. At\
      \ one point Candid is called both \u201Cher\u201D and \u201Che\u201D in a single\
      \ sentence. Slightly off-putting but easy enough to overlook.  \nThere is a\
      \ minor number of grammatical mistakes that could benefit from another proof-read\
      \ but again it isn't to the extent where it will cause confusion and force a\
      \ re-read from the player. \n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1] \n\n[b][i]Story: [/i][/b]\
      \ Sadly the plot had some very big ideas that just didn\u2019t quite reach the\
      \ mark for me. I felt as if there was way too much going on most of the time\
      \ yet none of it was fully explored. If each sub-plot was given more time and\
      \ detail it might have resonated differently with me.  \nBecause of the forced\
      \ relationship I was given with Mrs. Claus I did feel a lot of pressure to constantly\
      \ side with her and try to keep a good bond. This was even the case while playing\
      \ as a self-serving and grumpy elf but only slightly less so. Everything just\
      \ clashed together as if it were supposed to be an extended action scene but\
      \ ultimately, just became exhausting. \n\n[b][i]Characters: [/i][/b]It is a\
      \ huge problem for an interactive novel when none of the characters are relatable\
      \ or cause any stir of emotion from the reader and this was exactly the case\
      \ with [i]In the Service of Mrs. Claus[/i] for me. Yes, each of the characters\
      \ has a \u2018strong\u2019 personality trait but that was the only thing that\
      \ helps you tell them apart. As a reader, I knew basically next to nothing about\
      \ any of them as backstories were very limited, both in detail and scenes. This\
      \ is an enormous oversight from the author especially since the character you\
      \ play as has known each and every one of these people for many, many years.\
      \ As with the plot, I believe this could have been avoided with more time, effort\
      \ and detail being put in to character development and interaction!  \n\n[b][i]Romance:\
      \ [/i][/b]The romance was lack-luster and almost childlike. These characters\
      \ are centuries old yet still blush like a smitten schoolgirl over a tiny compliment,\
      \ are surprised by a quick hug or outright shocked that anyone would kiss them.\
      \ I know this \u201Cshy\u201D trope is a popular thing and although it\u2019\
      s not to my taste (I\u2019m just so sick of being put in the shoes of little\
      \ miss shy girl- like, why is it even so popular?), I was really hoping for\
      \ something a little more mature! This whole novel is a darker side of Christmas\
      \ after all; mature themes like politics, war and betrayal yet for some reason,\
      \ that couldn\u2019t be applied to the romance too.   \nWhile on the subject,\
      \ the \u2018romance\u2019 feels heavily like filer. It\u2019s basically non-existent,\
      \ not explored and the love confession feels like it comes from someone I generally\
      \ barely know at all. Interestingly enough, the romance is the only place you\u2019\
      ll really see any different scenes from your previous playthrough so that\u2019\
      s saying a lot really... \n\n[b][i]Replayability: [/i][/b]For an interactive\
      \ novel there just isn\u2019t enough replaybility. Yes, there are some minor\
      \ differences here and there based on your answers but it could quite easily\
      \ be overlooked at the same time. I struggled and failed to complete a second\
      \ playthrough but did managed to drag myself through the majority of it: It\
      \ was just so boring the second time. There have been other interactive novels\
      \ which I\u2019ve re-read a good six times and still find it exciting with text\
      \ here and there I hadn\u2019t managed to discover before. This, sadly, isn\u2019\
      t going to be one of those!  \n\n[b][i]Manual save/load function: [/i][/b] I\
      \ wanted to point out that this novel doesn't have a manual save system. I believe\
      \ this is normal for the program used to create these interactive novels but,\
      \ if like me, you read a lot of visual novels you are likely as spoilt as I\
      \ am and are used to being able to save/load at any time. \nThe book does, of\
      \ course, remember where you are when you close the program and will load at\
      \ the exact same place. Let's be real, my first one of these I had no clue how\
      \ it worked and had to ask a friend. Thought I'd just add that bit of information\
      \ in case you are as [strike]dopey[/strike] unsure as I was.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\
      \ \n\nI highly doubt this would be something I\u2019d recommend to anyone I\
      \ know. The whole thing would need a serious overhaul before I even considered\
      \ poking at it again to collect the remaining achievements \u2013 I'm an avid\
      \ achievement hunter by the way; Take that for what you will.  \nEven for the\
      \ low price I\u2019d say no and would likely request a refund if I still could."
