    reviews: "\u201CAll in all, Dear Devere is a delightfully enchanting story, masterfully\
      \ written and executed. I don\u2019t say this often, but, this game is absolutely\
      \ perfect from start to finish, and I highly recommend playing it when you have\
      \ the chance. Get caught up in Angela and Devere\u2019s story, and uncover a\
      \ little bit of magic.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://blerdyotome.com/2020/05/03/nanoreno-2020-review-dear-devere/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Blerdy Otome</a><br><br>\u201CThere are\
      \ so many things about \u201CDear Devere\u201D I want to praise, which makes\
      \ it hard for me to start this article. Do I start with applauding the strong\
      \ worldbuilding and dialogue writing skills of Jasmine Osler? Or should I rather\
      \ point out the congenial voice acting for the two lead characters, realized\
      \ by Chintarmanya Vivian as Angela Bard and Mike Young as Mr. Devere? Perhaps\
      \ I could pass one or two compliments to Paul Robins, the creator of the beautiful\
      \ soundtrack? Or wait, maybe I could begin by swooning over the well-crafted\
      \ illustrations for each envelope, that either act as visual, synoptic symbols\
      \ for the actual scene or as mystical foreshadowings for upcoming events? I\
      \ am unsure.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://game-curator.com/jams/nanoreno-2020-dear-devere/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Curator</a><br><br>\u201CThis game\
      \ was so enjoyable and unique. The writing is done really well, and you WILL\
      \ feel attached to Angela and Devere. Their romance is adorable, and the letter\
      \ correspondence really fleshed out their characters in ways that I\u2019m not\
      \ sure showing actual sprites would have done.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://sonicnancyfan.wordpress.com/2020/05/08/otome-bishoujo-review-dear-deverekaty133/\"\
