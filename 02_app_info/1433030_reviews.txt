As the previous 6, it's a time management game (i.e perform a serie of actions in a given time to reach a predetermined goal).\n\nFor those who don't know anything about the serie, it's a good enough time management game. It works without issue (on Win7 64bit at least), the game is responsive, there are in-game achievements, etc.\n\nFor those who are familiar with the serie, well, it's another story. What's obvious right at the beginning is the change in the levels' design. Obviously, a new team handled it. I finished 58 of the 60 levels with gold time on first try. That is clearly a sign something's different. Several levels could be finished in less than half the allotted time ! on first try !\nAnother change is that there's no more mana temple - only MOAI statues to get mana.\nNow for what I believe is the strangest part : the pirates (island invaders) can freely wander by and ask for ransom on any exploited land (farm / mine / etc.) What's strange is that you can't interact at all while he walks to said land. You could zap out the ghosts that randomly came and attacked your constructions in previous entries in the serie. No such luck here, which is VERY frustrating.\nThere's no bonus levels (the star ones that triggered on the map when all, on its way, were beaten with gold status). Also no bonus level in the menu once you've beaten all the \"standard\" levels.\nSome achievements imply to replay many times already beaten levels - I gave up once everything was with gold status.\n\nI think this entry is not as good as the previous entries in the serie, however it still is enjoyable. It took me 8 hours to make it through with several in-game achievements still open.\n","timestamp_created":1609024928,"timestamp_updated":1609024928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkP/W0PYCcvnGvQI="}
