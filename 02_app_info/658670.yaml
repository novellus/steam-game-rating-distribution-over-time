    review: Put your $1 in your pocket. So not worth it. $1 for 3 poorly designed
      levels with what can be described as weak at best competitive multiplayer. There
      is no actual competition. Levels drag on with too much time per round. No real
      game play or strategy. The only reason I don't request a refund is that in hopes
      that my $1 could possibly fund some improvement.
