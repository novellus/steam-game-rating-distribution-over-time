    about_the_game: Hooklings is an indie <strong>co-op platformer</strong> for four
      players that will transport you back to the arcades of the 80s. Just don't do
      anything nefarious that alters our timeline while you are there.<br><br><strong>New
      gameplay in a classic framework</strong> lets you grab and pull your enemies,
      make those enemies hit more enemies on the way to the wall which makes you experience
      joy.  But take care! Every attack can inadvertently result in your own death
      or the death of your friends. Then your friends will hate you and you will experience
      sadness. Sadness is the opposite of joy. We don't want that!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1018240/extras/hookligs.gif?t=1600465743"
