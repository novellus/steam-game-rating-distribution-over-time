RIP Multiplayer.\nPro7 Games as Publisher. RIP Community.\nGo buy freeware private server OG GunZ if you want to play.\nGunz 2 was fun until i could somewhat solo the endboss. Uninstall afterwards. Nothing you can do anymore.\nRIP[/i]\n\n[b]Now:[/b]\n\nI do not understand why i voted so harsh on this. \nThis game has awesome graphics and very little actual glitches, the devs really made their part in giving people the feeling of having the control without using things that feel like complete game breaking glitches.\nThe K-Style skills gained in Gunz 1 is of course worth nothing in this. Only the effort in learning it - something completely new - is.\nGunz 2 has its own ways of competition, especially the hero selection  is very small and fits nicely into whatever feeling of a world Gunz 1 has left behind. Of course all the K-Stylers of Gunz 1 feel intimidated if all their skill is reset to 0 with completely new features. \nThis is like comparing starcraft 1 to starcraft 2. Theres nothing to compare except for the looks and the noises and sounds. Completely different games each with their own ways of competition.\n\nIts 2019 and i still think the graphics of this game are pretty nice. Expecially if you consider all the indie devs having a low poly appearance in pretty much every single case.\n\n[i]\"Host system\"[/i]? Yes indeed RIP multiplayer, but the fact that the devs thought about giving the game the possibility to never die out just because there is no dependancy for servers any longer makes this game one of the better LAN party esport games. Period. \nHow do you wanna call your friends to play a game if the servers are down because you flamed the devs for decisions they HAD to make? Right. not at all, officially.\n\nHonestly Pro7 games is something i still consider a crapload of trashgames pushed into the masses. But gunz 2 is far away from that and we, the gunz 1 from back then gotta feel honored that they actually managed to push such an esport heavy title to such a broad audience. \n\n[i]Is it dead?[/i] Yes. \nYou gotta find people via external forums and wait days for them to be ready to actually be able to play a game as a duo.\n\n[i]\"Go buy freeware private server OG GunZ\"[/i] ?\nAs i said: This is the honorable release after Gunz 1 was shut down. If the community wasn't full of intimidated kids like me back then, the game probably would have made it into esport like we actually wanted it to ever since we learned that damn realod shot and half steps. \nNow we gotta start all over again. From scratch.\nAnd im sorry for it.","timestamp_created":1485948898,"timestamp_updated":1586810246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt9rQuvECf9SBcQ=="}
