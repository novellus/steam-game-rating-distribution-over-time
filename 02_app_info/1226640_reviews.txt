Now you have to progress towards each girl in a certain order and your progress seems to get deleted every update,\n\nEdit:\nSave files being deleted doesn't seem to be a problem anymore. A few updates have happened and I can confirm my progress is still there.\n\nI am not a fan of the star system that has been added. Some will feel it gives a sense of progression, which is fine. For me it feels like a content block that didn't use to be there. I preferred it when you could play the girls in the order you wanted.","timestamp_created":1604882964,"timestamp_updated":1609807035,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608418939,"developer_response":"Hello, thank you for the review. There are some issues with your review I would like to point out.\n\n1. first you do not need to do the dates in any particular order. If you have the stars needed to unlock a date you can play them in any order you like. We just added more things to achieve in the game. A sort of progression.\n2. the save file update you mentioned was a single update where we swapped systems in order to create a more secure and safe file system. It also allowed us to create new features like a tutorial, the currency system and unlockable cosmetics. Saying your progress is removed every update is just not true in the slightest.\n\nIf you could spare the time, please consider updating or correcting the review to correct these issues. Thanks!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4p7/+5/YCe4KhrQI="}
