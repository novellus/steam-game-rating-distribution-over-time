    review: 'This was not the best conversion to the Fantasy Grounds format. The campaign
      guide for example is mostly copied text put in an appendix. Locations are not
      pins on the maps as in other modules. Major NPCs are inside this story notes
      which make it harder to find them instead of having each as a story note in
      a NPC group. Even in story notes about ''meeting with x'' is not the NPC linked.

      Some text from the book is also missing but mostly about things outside the
      adventure location.

      The book only comes with one battle maps why the module also only have one battle
      map.

      The XP from some of the encounters is wrong, about 3-4 times higher than similar
      creature in SRD. For example the ''human warrior'' which have stats like a ''bandit''
      has CR 1 XP 200 while bandit in SRD has CR 1/8 XP 25. But has the same XP if
      the creature can be find in the SRD. This because they use the original stats
      from D&D Next Playtest. You might want to change these first otherwise the players
      might get confused then a thug gives the same XP as a big monster.

      The chapters are made up just as in the book and I think would be an easier
      read if one hade adjusted to be read in FG. At least I find it hard to follow
      how the story unfolds. Not for I know how to do it better...

      Another thing that is exactly as in the book is the random encounter tables.
      Even the text about the percentage that an encounter will happen is there. Like
      ''Encounter chance: 30% per hour" then a d10 table with encounters. Why not
      use the power of FG and and make 70% of the table no encounter. Why should I
      roll twice?


      Otherwise it''s a nice adventure but as DM you need prep time - don''t expect
      to pick this up and play the same day.'
