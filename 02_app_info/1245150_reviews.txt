While it adds a few new enemy types, most of them are slight variations on existing enemies. It also adds a new tileset to Corsus, but it winds up just being a reskin of the Catacombs tileset from Yaesha with a few acid pools added for good measure.\n\nMost of the additions to Corsus can only be experienced in Adventure Mode, not Campaign Mode, so you'll probably still skip the biome in your campaign NG+ runs. The only weapon added is a mod-locked sidearm that is decent, but doesn't measure up to most of the other ones. There's some new jewelry that's alright, but not as build-defining or game-breaking as the ones added in Subject. The armor sets the game adds are actually quite good, but are a serious pain to actually acquire. There's also this initially interesting \"Parasite\" mechanic that ultimately winds up being a bit too much work for too little payoff.\n\nThe new boss fights are actually quite good, though it's worth noting that one of them was added to the base game for free, so there's only really two new ones. Again though, both of them are pretty solid and use some interesting mechanics.\n\nIt also adds Survival Mode, which lets you play the game rogue-like style. It's a fun little time-waster and it gives you the opportunity to try out new gear and builds that you wouldn't have otherwise glanced at, but its a bit too shallow for my taste. Unfortunately, to get rewards for it in the main game requires some SERIOUS grinding in this mode, so don't think you can just duck in to grab the jewelry real quick. On top of that, the main reward from this mode is fragments that you spend on cosmetics, but they wind up being easier to farm by just playing the main game on the higher difficulty tiers.\n\nAgain, this expansion isn't BAD, but you're not really missing anything if you skip it and it honestly appears pretty weak in comparison to the far superior Subject DLC. If you can only spring for one DLC for this game, grab that one, otherwise swipe this up when it's on sale or something.","timestamp_created":1610044558,"timestamp_updated":1610044558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq8mI7/YCe8arwQI="}
