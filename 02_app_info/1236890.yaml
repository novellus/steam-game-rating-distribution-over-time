    review: 'Chris Christodoulou is back, offering another wonderfully atmospheric
      soundscape.


      The album comes in both FLAC and MP3 320kbit.


      *NOTES*

      -For some reason, the MP3 bonus tracks #21-23 are of 128kbit low-quality, as
      opposed to the standard 320kbit of all the other tracks, including bonus track
      #24. You can convert the higher-quality FLAC down to 320 MP3 yourself.'
