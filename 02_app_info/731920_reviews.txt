Bike infrastructure....\n\nGuess what? Bike infrastructure, to get maxed out (more than needed) in the united states, costs 1200 implementation points....\n\n1200, it costs literally 15 times more points to get ******* bike lanes built than to have a Government coup.\n\nGame makes no sense... don't get it","timestamp_created":1602245417,"timestamp_updated":1602245417,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gpvRhvUCd97lpgI="}
