It's a rough draft at the moment.  I can't honestly recommend it at this early stage. \n\nPros:  Similar to Anno Online and Settlers Online and several other browser based city builder games.\n\nCons: Font is really small. Can't restart the game at the moment.  Playing the game is really really slow.  Think weeks and months not hours and days to build anything meaningful in your towns.  Play anno online and you will get a taste for what these guys have in mind.","timestamp_created":1494890097,"timestamp_updated":1495580505,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":46,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.794671356678009033","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4uu7im9wCf8uceQ=="}
