I just forgot to turn it off over night.\n\nI enjoyed this game, my only gripe is that the collective items where often placed just where you click to go forward or backward to other scenes. Other than that it is a decent HOG. It continues the story from the first game, but explains enough to play this on it's own. There are a lot of scenes and the story is alright.","timestamp_created":1609628049,"timestamp_updated":1609628049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45tvT4vYCfoPxvwI="}
