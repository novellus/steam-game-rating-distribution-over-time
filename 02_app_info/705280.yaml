    review: 'The graphics and gameplay look simple at first glance but the cheap price,
      the different items and the reactions you get from NPCs, monster girls, and
      objects, and the humour makes this game worth buying.


      The Soundtrack bundle is worth getting, I think.  The music is so nice.'
