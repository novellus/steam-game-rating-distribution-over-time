Even though I gave the game a negative review, I still RECOMMEND it!!! It is a little treasure \n\nIt is fun. You can relax, the music lulls you, you come down and the time passes... I like it, really... it is \"Animal Crossing\" for the PC.\n\nNot to the full playable extent as \"Animal Crossing\", but you can play it on the PC. Better than nothing.\n\nBUT:\n\nNone of the 7 free theme packs, not even Steve, whose tent appears but cannot be entered, can be found in the game itself!\n\n0 out of 7 - you have to get that right first! \n\nALL are in the STEAM library, ALL are loaded multiple times, the game even loaded from the corresponding pages in the store - not a single themenpack appears in the game...\n\nWith Steve this is especially annoying because you can't get an Achivement: Enter all buildings...\n\nThese themepacks were actually one of the reasons for buying the game, only \n\nWHERE ARE THEM?\n\nThen suddenly all the fish disappear, not a single one appears. But you have 3 quests to catch fish. So then the quests in the daily quests are not all fulfillable when it says: complete 5 quests, because the 3 that you have are blocked, because no fish are there...\n\nThe game is now 5 1/2 years old. You would think that it would work... \n\nMaybe there is something I missed, but all DLC's are in the library on Steam, but not in the game. In the options I have also not found a button for activate this or this theme. \n\nThat the updating of the daily tasks is sometimes a bit messed up, you can get over that, that's not so dramatic. I can live with that...\n\nI'm lvl 17  and have now played 31 hours, all buildings and bridges built, including the large lighthouse.\n\nNow I would like to start decorating my islands.\n\nHope for tips and help. \n\nTHX\n\nEDIT 01:\n\nStill missing STEVE - and TWO archivements are not possible to get. \n\nMet all villagers and visit all buildings...\n\nIn the daylies it comes to visit him, pop up the town hall building. But she is is never there. \n\nAND YES, I know the camp in the back of the bank... thx ;)","timestamp_created":1607885284,"timestamp_updated":1609783446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525000035762786865","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn8Gk5/YCcoT1uQI="}
