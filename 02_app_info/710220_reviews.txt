Isolated from each other, both the shmup and RPG gameplay are a bit on the simpler side when you compare it to the more focused games in both genres. However, as a combination of the two Dreadstar ends up nailing the formula. There are plenty of RPG shmups out there, and nearly all of them absolutely suck, and after playing through Dreadstar I'm honestly amazed so many RPG shmups suck because Dreadstar makes the marriage of these two genres feel so natural.\n\nThe shooting gameplay is basically what you'd expect from the Genesis/Turbo-grafx era of shmups. Less about littering the screens with bullet hell and more about twitch reaction dodges. The RPG side of the gameplay has two elements to it: XP and equipment. Even if you fail to complete a level, you're always gaining XP which can help ease the frustration often present when learning the patterns in a new shmup. If you do manage to complete a level, you get a huge reward of gems which you can use to buy equipment for your ship. Nearly every aspect is customizable: weapons, shields, specials, ship size, speed, etc. Most of the replay value comes from experimenting with different builds, and while I've only cleared the game on normal I'm already positive that you'll need a variety of builds at your disposal to handle the variety in levels as you play on harder difficulties.\n\nOverall, the most dedicated shmup enthusiasts might not care for this game. But that's not who it's made for. This is a game for players who could never really get into the abstract sort of scoring gameplay that shmups have evolved into over the years. It's a game more for the strategic-minded players who appreciate the fundamentals of shmup gameplay.","timestamp_created":1607589320,"timestamp_updated":1607589320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1MrypfYCepjQuAI="}
