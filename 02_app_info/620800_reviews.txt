When you put the pitches on HoF difficulty, it really feels like you are facing a major league pitcher. It does suck there isn't an actual 9 inning game option but you can use the batting practice and play games that way, just by keeping track in your head. Maybe one day we will get a full VR baseball sim. It's a pretty great feeling when you turn on a ball and watch it soar 500ft. Definitely one of the most satisfactory feelings I've ever had in VR. If you enjoy baseball or sports vr games in general, I recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1605049316,"timestamp_updated":1605049316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqp6Z2vUCe7bSrQI="}
