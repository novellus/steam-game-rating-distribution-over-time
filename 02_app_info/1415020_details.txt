Now justice will be served! BLOODY SERVICE is a dark, gory and violent coming-of-age slasher FMV Visual Novel with gruesome deaths and clever one-liners related to tennis. Game, set, machete!","supported_languages":"English, Spanish - Latin America","reviews":"“The premise is fresh, there are characters to love, characters to hate, and plenty of unlikeable people who die in often pretty gruesome ways. Not only that, there are a ton of little details and implications about the plot that can be made, which makes the story that much more interesting. Everything a good slasher film or FMV needs.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.dreadxp.com\/review\/bloody-service-review-fmv-serves-an-ace-for-slashers\/\"
