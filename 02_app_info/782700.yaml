    review: "Ok the game cost cents , and there is no much more than some minutes\
      \ of game, if you go fast :\n the game is straightforward,  it looks like a\
      \ teatre where you click over the right place and continue, ii's very easy .\
      \ The problem is the ending, there is two options and any of them gives you\
      \ the same result, it's intentional ? I missed something?"
