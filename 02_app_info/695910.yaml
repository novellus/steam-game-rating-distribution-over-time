    review: "The Relentless is a kind of arcade game where you'll need to move to\
      \ dodge laser walls(fun) hit incoming missiles(alsofun) recharge your weapon\
      \ by finding floating balls in your area(not as fun) and shoot targets to score\
      \ points. It is strictly this, no bells or whistles aside from a couple different\
      \ variations on the game such as a mode where 1 hit kills you and a mode where\
      \ you have a set amount of time that can increase based on score.\n\nI like\
      \ the aesthetic and the sounds. I do enjoy the core gameplay however there are\
      \ some hindrances.\n\n1. Ammo spawns are annoying and reduce fun from overall\
      \ experience. An option for unliimited ammo or a different way to reload would\
      \ be welcome.\n2. Game difficulty ramps up too quickly. \n3. UI is confusing\
      \ and at times annoying. Choosing power up in that one mode isn't fun. The UI\
      \ should be out of sight while playing to create a clear game experience. Less\
      \ distractions the better. \n4. Overall I would enjoy this game if it improved\
      \ on its deficiencies.\n\nFinally, while there is nothing wrong with using high\
      \ score as you main goal, it would be nice if there were levels to progress\
      \ through (could even change color schemes the further you progress) and perhaps\
      \ some form of reward for progress made outside of steam achievements.\n\nSadly\
      \ in this form I can only recommend you give it a try and not to buy."
