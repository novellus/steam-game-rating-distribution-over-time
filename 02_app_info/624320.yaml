    about_the_game: Years after leaving his family to wander Overworld, Viktor returns
      home to find his mother has long since passed away and his brother, Zane, has
      risen from the rank of recruit to commander of the Legion. Although his ascent
      through the ranks was quick, Zane finds himself struggling with the many pressures
      that come with his position. Having left his brother to struggle alone once
      before, Viktor is determined to join the Legion to support his brother in any
      way he can. Shortly after he joins, however, a chain of events begins to unfold
      that will change the face of Overworld forever. Things are not always as they
      seem, and in bloody times like these, loyalty is more precious than gold.<h2
