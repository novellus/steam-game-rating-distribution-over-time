So it's not like I paid much. Still not great.\n\nI would say this is a very condensed version of Runescape as a single player, except that the game is unfinished. I had to watch a walkthrough to find out how to heal myself because although a lot was ripped from Runescape, cooked food healing you isn't one of them. Interface is simple, only a few keys actually do anything and I've done three quests and can't find any indication there are more. I seem to have explored all the areas, The Forest, The Bandits, Cleverville and one other section I can't remember the name of. The tutorial doesn't really explain how to do everything and good luck getting help when you get stuck.\n\nOh, and although I don't pay much attention to the storyboards, the misspellings and grammatical errors are prolific enough I noticed.\n\nIt'd be a fun game...if it were actually finished. It just doesn't go very far.","timestamp_created":1593655436,"timestamp_updated":1593655436,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwroTRhvMCeNSJkgI="}
