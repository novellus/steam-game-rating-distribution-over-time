    about_the_game: 'Business Magnate is a tycoon business simulation game where you
      can create all types of businesses: Cars, rockets, phones, tanks, trucks, airplanes,
      computers and ships. Design, produce, market and sell them. You can even run
      multiple companies at the same time. Become the ultimate Business Magnate (or
      Business Magnet).<h2 class="bb_tag">What can you do in the game</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      Company types: Cars, rockets, phones, tanks, trucks, airplanes, computers, ships<br></li><li>
      Build offices, warehouses, production facilities<br></li><li> Design products<br></li><li>
      Research new components and product types<br></li><li> Produce products and
      components<br></li><li> Run marketing campaigns<br></li><li> Manage employees</li></ul><h2
      class="bb_tag">How it works</h2>Start by creating a company: First, choose what
      to produce. For example, you can design cars (combustion engine based, electric,
      hybrid), then produce, market and sell them. Other types of products are trucks,
      phones, computers, ships, airplanes, tanks and even rockets. Once you are successful,
      you can even start more companies, and run them at the same time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Design
      and Research</h2><br>In order to meet market demands, you need to design your
      products so that customers will actually want them, and won''t prefer to buy
      your competitors products. Research new technologies and design new products
      as your move on to fit into a moving market. For example for cars, you want
      to research bigger and more efficient batteries, if you decide to produce electric
      cars, or more performant combustion engines if you want to produce gasoline
      or diesel based cars.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br>The game is running
      in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time. Manage employees,
      track financial and sales data, start and run marketing campaigns, analyze the
      market. Expand your company when you have figured out how everything works and
      manage the production plan and build new facilities, warehouses, offices or
      even launch pads.'

    review: "Played for an hour, got through the basics. Interface needs improvement.\
      \ The game looks nice, sound efx minimal. The idea is fun. Made money easily.\
      \ \n\nIts a good time killer. But nor sure I will play it very often. Streamline\
      \ the menu and the email annoyance.\nbetter tutorial."
