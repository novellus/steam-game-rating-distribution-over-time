      /><br><br><strong>For Those That Like to Read</strong><br>Hey everyone, my name
      is Jeff Weber. I've been making physics games in my spare time for over 10 years.  Just
      Flip is my latest and greatest!  <br>Like all my physics games, it gets to the
      point quick with minimal fluff and nonsense.  <br><br>Launch yourself, parkour
      style, over a single massive mountain full of steep cliffs, ski slopes, and
      interesting obstacles. Flip, Ski, Fall down, rage, get up, keep flipping!<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1072750/extras/SpringSpringSki.gif?t=1607258124"
      /><br><br>The controls in Just Flip are simple in concept, but require some
      practice to get a feel for the inertia of the flip.  The launch and flip mechanic
      has been honed, tweaked, and iterated-on for over a year to make it smooth and
      satisfying.<br>Just pull down and back sling-shot style anywhere on the screen
      and release to launch. Once in the air, mouse down to crouch or release to extend.  Stick
      the landing and repeat.<br><br>Inspired by the world of Getting Over It with
      Bennet Foddy, Just Flip consists of a single large continuous mountain of stuff
      to flip and ski over. You will not be artificially teleported back to the start
      if you fail to stick a landing, you will simply get back up and keep flipping.
      Of course, if you fail to stick the landing in the wrong place, gravity might
      have a say in where you end up.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1072750/extras/LongFallGetBackUp.gif?t=1607258124"
