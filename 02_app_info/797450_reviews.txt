I'm seeing two changes:\n\n- There's now an option to change what the colored tiles look like, and\n- In previous games, you could switch to any of the available colors at will.  In this game, the developer has added secret keys that you uncover as you complete the puzzle.  Those keys unlock the various colors.  So, you can't switch to another color until you've found a key.  On one hand, that's pretty nice since it makes the puzzles just a tad harder.  On the other hand, I'm not sure how much I like it since it makes the puzzles just a tad harder :)\n\nAnd, as always, the game is simply 100 fine, colorful nonograms that took me 9.7 hours to complete (about one more hour than for previous games). Even at the list price of almost $7, it's worth it.","timestamp_created":1555882056,"timestamp_updated":1555882056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605081498622894287","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlIPzoOoCfovcvwE="}
