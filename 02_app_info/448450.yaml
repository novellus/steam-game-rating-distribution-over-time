    review: 'I hesitate to give it a thumbs down, but I''ve decided it deserves it.
      The reason is that the controls are painfully, agonizingly and disturbingly
      slow. For example, it''s close to ten seconds after hitting the back arrow for
      the scene to go back. It''a the same length of time usually when moving from
      room to room, or even picking something up.


      It gets most things right. The graphics are decent and the puzzles are challenging
      enough. It auto-saves when you exit, and you can turn off the music, the slowness
      of its controls is maddening. (and it ain''t my computer, I''m well within the
      requirements)'
