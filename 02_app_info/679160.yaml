      \ I started scrawling away on the whiteboard literally seconds after jumping\
      \ into the app for the first time, and the accuracy of the SteamVR tracking\
      \ allowed me to create clear, quality images.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/collabhub-virtual-whiteboard-plenty-possibilities/\"\

    review: "Beautiful app, with incredible potential, at least for the work I do.\
      \ I'm planning on using this app in combination with LIV to create tutorials\
      \ in mixed reality. This is a project that I've had for a long time, but I hadn't\
      \ been able to find the right tool. This program has everything I need, but\
      \ it is clear that this is still in an Early Access stage. It crashed a couple\
      \ of times during my first test drive and I got a little sick after a while\
      \ probably due to a low framerate. \nI really hope the developer is aware some\
      \ of us will use this app not specifically to collaborate with others in the\
      \ same environment, but to create material in mixed reality. There is no other\
      \ whiteboard app with these capabilities (like an import picture feature that\
      \ actually works) and in such amazing environments. The summer house is simply\
      \ fantastic."
