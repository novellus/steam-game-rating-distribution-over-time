Single player is also decent. I've played the demo more atm, so keen for this full version to see how you guys develop it with new mechs and maps and stuff. The game modes are mint. \n\nAlso, can't work out online multiplayer, if it even is in yet. If not, looking forward to it one day hopefully. \n\nThanks again. And buy this if you got a spare $6.","timestamp_created":1472983653,"timestamp_updated":1472983653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4qNuq+tYCfa7WYA=="}
