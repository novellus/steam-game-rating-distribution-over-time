I recommend buying this game. \n\nAs you look into the face of a clean glassy wave, you can carve it up.\nThe Surfer is smooth and fluid while surfing. you can carve, do cutbacks and generally surf on a wave.  \n\nI hope other people support this game as the developer clearly surfs and can translate this into a surfing game. \nPersonally i was not initially impressed in the idea of travelling and searching for spots, but the implementation of this principle is really good. You can find all sorts of varied waves on the world map.\n\nAs it is early release, expect a game that is not fully complete. but the surfing works really well. The entry screen and navigation menu is functional.","timestamp_created":1609509068,"timestamp_updated":1609509068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzuuN3/YCe8qzvwI="}
