    review: "This is more of a tentative Not Recommend, since there's a lot of good\
      \ elements to this VN but they ultimately aren't brought together in a satisfying\
      \ way.\n\nDon't Forget Our Esports Dream is a fun VN that serves as a prequel\
      \ to SC2VN. The art is pretty, the UI looks snappy, I liked most of the character\
      \ designs and dialogue, and the music was very good. As an aside, the minigame\
      \ featured prominently while playing was also pretty fun. \n\nDespite this,\
      \ I wasn't sold on the story. The protagonist, Bolt, is a pro-gamer trying to\
      \ make it big in the South Korean Esports scene with help from his friend who\
      \ he has \"a latent crush\" on, Jett. The premise is interesting, and I enjoyed\
      \ playing SC2VN, so I figured I should give this game a shot. Unfortunately,\
      \ the climb to the top story that made SC2VN so compelling did not translate\
      \ well to the bigger scale of \"Don't Forget Our Esports Dream.\" It seems like\
      \ this VN tries to bite off more than it can chew. The plot deals with a pro-gamer's\
      \ struggle to be the best, a hinted at but ultimately never-explored romance\
      \ (for reasons that aren't really explained), and then tries to comment on issues\
      \ ranging from the organizational mess that is international esports, female\
      \ representation in gaming, the bureaucratic nature of esports in South Korea,\
      \ and even the unhealthy amount of studying and CSAT prep that Korean students\
      \ face. \n\nIt's too much. The plot brings up these issues, has the characters\
      \ discuss them, puts the issues to the side, and then suddenly realizes at the\
      \ end that they need to resolve everything and just turns it into a massive\
      \ infodump of dialogue between the two main characters. It felt like the story\
      \ couldn't keep track of its own subplots, and it was a frustrating experience\
      \ when things just ultimately weren't resolved beyond a simple 5 line conversation.\
      \ \n\nIf you enjoyed SC2VN I recommend playing this. Honestly, I'd probably\
      \ recommend playing this even if you aren't familiar with SC2VN. But the ending\
      \ and epilogue is frustratingly shallow and doesn't do the great premise of\
      \ the VN justice."
