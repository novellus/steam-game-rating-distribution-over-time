The enthusiasm and creativity of the developers is remarkably inspiring. The game revolutionizes the genre, by adding a infinite scaling difficulty, which allows for great replay value. Halloween Puzzles is my favorite game, and I cannot wait to see the upcoming and elusive sequel, Elden Puzzles!","timestamp_created":1609455963,"timestamp_updated":1609455963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6HD3fYCfqSevwI="}
