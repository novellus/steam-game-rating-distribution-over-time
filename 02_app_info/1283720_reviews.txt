When you mine down to far you just keep falling. If you were to press the \"Respawn\" button and press space after it keeps pressing \"Respawn\". If you knock a enemy in the air it just flies to the left which is funny but weird. The tutorial in the game is under all the UI. Anyways its good the moving is good with the motion blur, ect. I also watched the YouTube video linked and I noticed that you are pretty young. That's not bad, it is cool because most people can't even make a game this good that are older then I assuming you are!","timestamp_created":1592331538,"timestamp_updated":1592331538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5eGW3/ICfs65jgI="}
