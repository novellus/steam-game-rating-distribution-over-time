    review: "It's exactly what the description says, a minimalist game, nothing to\
      \ do with adventure though, just a plain arcade shooter.\nThe controls are a\
      \ bit weird, that on a controller you both speed up and shoot with the shoulder\
      \ trigger buttons, but you can also play with the mouse and shoot with the spacebar.\
      \ \nI couldn't say what is better, mouse/keyboard is faster but in other levels\
      \ the controller felt better.\n\nYou get a few normal levels, boss, and that\
      \ twice more (about 10-12 levels total including boss fights if i am not mistaken)\
      \ so not that many as it says in the description but it's enough.\n\nTo adress\
      \ a negative review from 1 person.\n-Yes you can get hurt by hitting walls,\
      \ but that's usually if you go too fast (which makes sense) go slow and it barely\
      \ happens.\n-Boss fights, it might feel slow,  but just keep the shoot button\
      \ pressed instead of aim and then trying to fire, it will go a lot faster.\n\
      \nFor the price it's an okay game, but prepared to get frustrated (if you don't\
      \ mind that). \nMy only gripe is the survivor mode where you have to survive\
      \ 8 waves (the achievement says 9 but when you start the 9th, you already get\
      \ the achievement so you don't have the survive that one) but those are really\
      \ insane the higher you go. \nYou can try to get a record, but it's pure torture\
      \ rather then something fun."
