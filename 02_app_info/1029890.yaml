    about_the_game: The cameras are all focused on you; the center of the scene. Not
      just in character, you are the character. The part to play is singularly yours.
      Written just for you. You are met with silence. No barking orders from the director.
      No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand
      to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words.<br><br>Your past
      has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required
      to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you,
      not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within
      that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences
      drive you into who, or what, you must play. <br><br>Darkness surrounds as you
      stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat
      are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras
      pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity.<br><br>A deep
      and commanding voice rises from the distance. Act.<br><br>What part will you
      play?<br><br><strong>Game Features:</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Story-driven
      exploration - You must explore the world around you. Discover your past, and

      Your world may change with the slightest of provocations, you must decide what

      of the ship that play the scenes for the film become ever more incredible, and

    short_description: Layers of Fear 2 is a first-person psychological horror game
      with an emphasis on exploration and story. Players control a Hollywood actor
      who heeds the call of an enigmatic director to take on the lead role in a film
      shot aboard an ocean liner. Beware, for all may not truly be what it seems.

    review: "On one hand, this is similar to first game. On other.. let's me be straight.\
      \ For me, it was struggling, almost whole time. Story didn't touch me and in\
      \ parts when I wasn't pursued by monster I suffered from very slowing storytelling.\
      \ For comparison, first game could be beaten in something about two hours (here\
      \ it took four, I tried to make it quick). And there wasn't any moment when\
      \ I wanted to stop. \nSecond part is more flash-y, has more creaking sounds,\
      \ its four acts (in fact five, but last one is short) are long and filled with\
      \ information you couldn't understand at early stage. \nI get only one ending\
      \ and I don't think I could bare another playthrough."
