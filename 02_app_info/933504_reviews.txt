Some stuff in here is really good and practically game changing, others are... pretty much worthless. To review each individual piece:\n\n[b]Costumes:[/b] They're alright. Decent mix of cool aesthetics and fanservice, my favorites are definitely Mitsunari and Daqiao's but they're all pretty good. Still doesn't do much to help this game's overall lack of costumes, but I'll take what I can get.\n\n[b]Mounts:[/b] They all look pretty good, but only two of them are really worth using: Sleipnir for having the highest speed of any mount, and Fenrir for its unique attacks that, while low on damage, are decently effective at crowd control. And Ultimate is adding an even faster horse, so... unless you like one mount's aesthetic, this is pretty inconsequential.\n[u]EDIT:[/u] Koei Tecmo, in their infinite wisdom, decided to make Infernal Black an early purchase exclusive. You can't even pay for it later. Wonderful decision, very consumer friendly, you are an amazing company. Sketchy as hell business practices aside, unless you bought the game early, Sleipnir is still the fastest mount in the game.\n\n[b]Sacred Treasures:[/b] By FAR the best part of the season pass. Every single standard treasure gets a second variant which has completely different normal and charge spells. These add so much more freedom to each character's playstyle, and helps a lot with the repetition of sacred treasures between characters. Most of them are just plain fun to use, and there aren't any really bad ones like some of the basegame treasures (you know the ones). Even if everything else in the season pass doesn't interest you, I'd recommend picking these up individually or waiting for a sale on the pass just for these. They're excellent.\n\n[b]Scenarios:[/b] Not bad. It's nice to have more endgame level challenges, though the stories are corny as to be expected. If you really want to unlock the later camp rewards and don't want to grind Pandemonium, these give a lot of crystals from their battle objectives, which is a plus.\n\n[b]BGMs:[/b] Some decent songs, It's Saw Squared is an absolute jam and the world could always use more Oriental Rush remixes. For the most part, the basegame's OST is better in my eyes, but these are nice to have I guess.\n\n[b]Challenge Mode:[/b] Absolutely [i]horrible.[/i] Dull, copy pasted challenges from DW8XL, none of the rewards are worth it and they were all locked behind this mode post-release. Not to mention they're full of blatantly hacked high scores, so they're not even worth playing for the competitive factor. Worthless.\n\nOverall, this is a mixed bag. It goes on sale usually whenever the game itself goes on sale, so if you can pick it up for $15 or so, I'd highly recommend it. Would definitely avoid at full price though, $30 is [i]not[/i] worth it for everything you're getting.","timestamp_created":1577995569,"timestamp_updated":1597347126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr9vT9PMCeZ2p6QE="}
