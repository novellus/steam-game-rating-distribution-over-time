That's hopefully a bug. They get stuck, show nonsensical paths through and around buildings, and new commands don't affect them.\n\n- Group movement isn't functional. Individuals will choose ridiculous paths you couldn't see coming, apparently because of obstacles. This can lead to stuck units as described above.\n\n- Scratch that: Individual orders lead to the same problems anyway.\n\n- The command system is a mess. It lacks info and feedback, but it's hard to say if it's unresponsive or buggy. At the very least, it requires to get uses to it.\n\n- Big absentee: The UNDO command. Can't find one. A TBS without an Undo command, that doesn't make any sense. What is the point of the \"End Turn\" command then?\n\n- Big annoyance: The camera keeps rotating against my will, while translating from actor to actor. It's fine to center on a unit you select, although I'd rather keep it a proper command (like a double click.) Just stop ruining my lovingly selected angle and losing me on unfamiliar maps.\n\n- Huge absentee: You can't save. This is a forgivable oversight since it's the first strategy game ever designed.... just kidding, an unabashed shame is what it is. A system built for hours long battles. Uninterrupted hours, as the moron doesn't even save on quit.\n\nFurthermore, the game has memory issues (like using 10 times too much,) loads forever, stutters, and sometimes can't even close cleanly (external kill required.)\n\nI need to decide if I get a refund, or if I give the devs a chance to fix things. On one hand, I'd love to visit the rest of these attractive maps. On the other hand, the lack of saving makes this title an exemplar of incompetent pointlessware, and I should assist natural selection by not feeding lazy developers.\n","timestamp_created":1603554075,"timestamp_updated":1603554075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545960366725921631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l6zRrfUCcsfsqQI="}
