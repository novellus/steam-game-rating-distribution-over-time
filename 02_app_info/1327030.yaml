    about_the_game: "Good security starts with a strong password! But strong passwords\
      \ are difficult to remember. What if there was a way to remember a simple password\
      \ and have it changed into a strong password token? Easy Password Tokenizer\
      \ was made just for that. It turns your easy to remember password into a strong\
      \ tokenized one. Install now and be safe!<br><br><strong>Why should I use Easy\
      \ Password Tokenizer?</strong><br>Because humans are really bad at coming up\
      \ with truly random passwords. People often use words or numbers that mean something\
      \ to them: a pet\u2019s name, their mother's maiden name, their kids\u2019 birthdays,\
      \ song lyrics, etc The problem with this is that you end up with passwords that\
      \ are easy to guess. <br><br>And remember: it\u2019s not humans who are doing\
      \ the guessing. It\u2019s computers. An ordinary desktop computer can test over\
      \ a hundred million passwords per second \u2014 and this number climbs to billions\
      \ of passwords per second if the computer is using GPU-based cracking tools.\
      \ Password length and complexity are essential. <br><br>So don\u2019t risk it.\
      \ Use a random password generator like Easy Password Tokenizer to create long,\
      \ truly random passwords that, even with the strongest computers, take ages\
      \ to crack.<br><br><strong>No data is saved</strong><br>There are a lot of password\
      \ solutions out there but most of them save passwords in a central place behind\
      \ a master password. You essentially outsource your passwords to these solutions.\
      \ If the website or app you use has a vulnerability or gets hacked you still\
      \ lose all your passwords.<br>Easy Password Tokenizer does not save anything\
      \ for you. All you need is an easy to remember password and it will generate\
      \ the strong password for you.<br><br><strong>What are strong passwords?</strong><br>Long:\
      \ The longer a password, the more secure it is. A strong password should be\
      \ at least 12 characters long.<br>Random: Strong passwords are a combination\
      \ of letters, numbers, cases and symbols to form an unpredictable string of\
      \ characters that doesn\u2019t resemble words or names.<br>Unique: A strong\
      \ password should be unique to each account to reduce vulnerability in the event\
      \ of a hack.<br><br><strong>Do I need a unique password for every account?</strong><br>Yes!\
      \ Using the same password across multiple accounts is a huge no-no. If hackers\
      \ learn the password to one of your accounts, they\u2019ll have your password\
      \ for all the others, too. So never recycle passwords. Use different, unique\
      \ passwords for every account. (And no, simply adding an exclamation mark or\
      \ other character to the end of a password does not make it unique or strong.\
      \ Hackers can easily crack variations of passwords like this.)<br>With Easy\
      \ Password Tokenizer however you can do this in your base password (the easy\
      \ to remember one). Just adding one character to the end or changing the length\
      \ changes the token completely!"
