It's an addicting challenge.  \n\nYour multiplier is a set of three angled targets on the side (ABC) and you can activate C on the left flipper's lane (which I haven't figured out an easy way to do yet).  The ramp has three stations at the end of it with increasingly difficult (though randomness can get you really lucky) drop target sets corresponding to each. It's very easy to see which stations you have unlocked by looking at the color-coded lights under the ramp.  When you hit ramp with stations unlocked, it'll stop the ball and give a satisfying chime for each one in order.  If you don't have station 1 yet, it'll just fall out the top so try and get them in order (Good luck).  The middle has a feature that loops the ball to the other flipper.  Overall, it's a really well-designed table and I wish I could own the real thing.","timestamp_created":1608325058,"timestamp_updated":1608325058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Znpu/YCd76juwI="}
