    review: MEDIUM The route doesn't looks that great to me. The colors are off and
      some rocks float. Also, it looks nothing like the feather river canyon. It doesn't
      come with enough rolling stock.(2 engines, a caboose, container flats, a bulkhead,
      a boxcar, and a reefer) but other than that it's a good route. And it's Western
      Pacific.
