    about_the_game: Mason is pure sandbox and more of a toy simulator than a game.
      You don't have to work toward achieving any goals or grind resources. Just build
      as much as your heart desires. You can build anything from a small structure
      to a large city or even multiple cities in a single scene.<br>Animated figures
      will bring life to your builds and help you to forge a story and role-play.<br><br>*You
      will not be able to save your progress in the demo version.<h2 class="bb_tag">Infinite

      unique bricks. The basic bricks collection contains generic shapes that can
      be used in any setting. Other collections contain bricks, furniture, and figures
      that are based on a theme. You can construct any shape and decorate structures
      with extensive collections of bricks and figures.<h2 class="bb_tag">Modify Brick's
      Material</h2>You can apply color and materials such as wood, metal and stone
      to each brick.<h2 class="bb_tag">Top-Down and First-Person Modes</h2>The top-down
      camera gives you full control while building structures. first-person mode lets
      you explore the environment from close range.
