    review: 'Some weird server issues, but messing with your DNS cache can evidently
      fix them, as it did for me. The game is just as pristine and unique as when
      it came out, shedding the skin of "Left 4 Dead ripoff'' right out of the gate
      with some really meaty melee combat and some really wonderful visuals. A little
      short, but I guess that''s why there are like 6 DLC packs for it that are definitely
      worth it. 4-stacking in this game is fun as hell and when the samey source-engine
      gunplay of L4D2 starts to wear thin, this is a much different but equally satisfying
      co-op experience. Definitely a recommend, much simpler and easier to get into
      than its sequel. Big hopes for the upcoming 40K version, as fatshark are very
      faithful to the world and the hilarious characters fit perfectly into the overzealous
      and grandiose tapestry of warhammer.


      Get it for your mates!'
