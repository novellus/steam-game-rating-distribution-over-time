      \ a girl trapped between two contrasting worlds: the ordinary world, and the\
      \ World Behind the Gate. After suddenly finding herself alone in the World Behind\
      \ the Gate, Rehtona collects \u201Cmemory fragments\u201D (scattered throughout\
      \ this world) in order to find out what happened \u2013 but whenever a complete\
      \ image is assembled, a memory that doesn't seem to belong to Rehtona becomes\
      \ imprinted onto her mind ... <br><br>Each level features a complete sequence\
      \ of puzzles derived from the interactions between the two worlds. Players act\
      \ in one world, and anticipate how it will impact the other world in order to\
      \ overcome puzzles and find memory fragments.<br><br>As she painstakingly collects\
      \ each missing piece by bouncing between two distinct dimensions, Rehtona\u2019\
      s ultimate quest for the truth may be more than she bargained for \u2013 a shocking\

      .<br><br>As Rehtona chats with friends in the town square, the world as she\
      \ knows it began to change without warning \u2013 and another world appeared\
      \ to overlap with reality. Suddenly, Rehtona finds herself alone in the town\
      \ square \u2013 and an unfamiliar door appears before her eyes. A weak voice\
      \ could be heard behind the door \u2026 calling her name. <br><br>Rehtona musters\
      \ up the courage to open the door, but she could see nothing but an isolated\
      \ world beyond it. Then her own world begins to shatter as she falls into unconsciousness.\
      \ <br><br>When she awakes, she realizes that she is still in her own world \u2013\
      \ but that world has now become empty and isolated \u2026 similar to what she\
      \ saw on the other side of the door. She finds a photo in a picture frame lying\
      \ in front of her house containing a simple yet mysterious message: \u201CFind\
