It is not an accurate reflection of what virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) should be. Nor is it an accurate representation of exposure in general. This VRET system is potentially harmful to any one with clinical or subclinical levels of anxiety. I would NOT recommend this to a client and if I did I would open myself up to legal action due to the potentially psychologically harmful content within (i.e., the 'warning' page and the entire antidote thing).\n\nAlso to the delivers, please learn the different between rubber hand illusion and general and other proprioception illusions. (You can could both from this environment - not that you do - but what is described is a general proprioception illusion).","timestamp_created":1518190978,"timestamp_updated":1518191303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.652783215045928955","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lZvQveECfsi1mAE="}
