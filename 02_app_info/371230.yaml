      \ Ueland have found the perfect mix of comedy and thriller, a sort of Ten Little\
      \ Indians meets Weekend at Bernie\u2019s meets Wall Street. The laughs are original\
      \ and sharp but the style is pure fifties, like something from the Hitchcock\
      \ canon (or really Hitchcock through the lens of Mel Brooks).\u201D<br><a href=\"\
