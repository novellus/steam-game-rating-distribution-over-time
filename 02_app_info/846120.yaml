    review: "Hello Pollution feels like someone had the idea of making a game about\
      \ hiding trash underground. And that's as far as that idea goes. The story almost\
      \ goes somewhere a few different times but doesn't actually go anywhere. It's\
      \ boring. And repetitive. Once you play the first level, you know the entire\
      \ gameplay loop. It never gets more difficult or interesting. In fact, I would\
      \ say it only gets less interesting as you play it. The physics are incredibly\
      \ loose leading to failures when you haven't even touched anything. The \"story\"\
      , if you can call it that, is just random characters cryptically telling you\
      \ that they have committed crimes against humanity or nature and you have to\
      \ put the barrels in a hole now. Sometimes you can burn stuff. That's it. That's\
      \ the whole game.\n\n I bought this for $2.59 and I felt ripped off. The fact\
      \ that the dev wants $12.99 normally makes this an ab-so-lute DO NOT BUY."
