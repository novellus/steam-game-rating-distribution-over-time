Son!” And it’s a very accurate description. It’s all in good fun, though, as it’s a fun, slapstick comedy that doesn’t take itself seriously, at all.\n\nThe focus is squarely on the puzzles with the story’s main purpose being to string a bunch of ridiculous events together to keep the player moving from puzzle to puzzle. The puzzles themselves range from fun to frustrating, especially the last couple.\n\nThe artwork is reminiscent of the Paper Mario cut-out style and works quite well. It’s colorful, playful, and enjoyable to view. It’s a bit of a contrast to the overall tone to some of the game’s content, which can get quite crude. This also carries over to the game’s humor, which starts of okay but gets pretty vulgar. It’s pretty juvenile, but the game advertises that upfront, so it’s not a surprise.\n\nOverall, a fun puzzle game with colorful art and decent music. I enjoyed my time with it and hope to see more from the devs.","timestamp_created":1609381423,"timestamp_updated":1609381423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+fSm2/YCeML8vgI="}
