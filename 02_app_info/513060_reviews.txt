I would not recommend the game as it is now, assuming no further updates. I will leave my original thoughts up, however.\n\nI enjoyed this game very much, for many of the same reasons that other reviewers have stated: the variety of heros/creatures and their abilities is great, especially when combined with solid turn-based combat featuring smart AI and roomy maps that let you outplay your opponent. If you're just looking to kill some time on a fun little turn-based strategy game with some decent depth, this game could a good choice. There are some problems, however.\n\nMost importantly, development seems to be glacially slow, despite the fact that the dev had been fairly active on the forums. This is just speculation, but based on their responses, funding for the game seems to be rather low, and that combined with how long it has been since the last update leads me to believe that further updates are not going to be seen in the near future. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was already finished and polished, but it isn't. \n\nA couple things bug me quite a bit, mainly the fact that you have to pick each class and buy each of their abilities before you can see what they do- you can't make a decision based on what you know, but rather based on what you can guess or what you have learned from taking it in the past (if you can remember such an occurence). Also, the way that towns level up makes leveling your heroes awkward, since you want your stronger heroes out front conquering new lands, but the new lands will be at a very low level, whereas the towns in the back where you want your weaker heroes to level safely will be much higher level and their quests will be very difficult for your weaker heroes to complete. The quests themselves do not have that much variety- there are like 3-4 types of quests, the main differences being which units are in the quests (determined by the location of the town) and the levels of those units (determined by the level of the town). \n\nThese issues aren't gamebreaking by any means, but they are enough to dampen my enjoyment of it and they have made the game stale for me after a relatively short period of time. If development begins to ramp up again and this game gets some quality of life changes that give us (the players) more information on the units and abilities along with more varied quests/combat environments, I could definitely see myself coming back to it, however. Alternative game modes such as a Campaign, co-op/hotseat/any form of multiplayer would also tempt me back if I managed to get a friend into the game. I have mixed feelings about this game, but I did get quite a few hours of enjoyment out of it in the end, so I will give it a tentative reccommendation.","timestamp_created":1534921016,"timestamp_updated":1544421341,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49O6ry+cCcqyCqQE="}
