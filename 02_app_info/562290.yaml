      /><br>Knights of Galiveth is a Multi-Character Metroidvania Style Action RPG
      Featuring Permadeath. Explore different fantasy environments with the 8 Knights
      of Galiveth, each with their own stats and skills that make exploring different
      with each character. Some areas will only be accessible to specific characters
      while other areas will require you to use teamwork between characters to get
      through. The game features &quot;permadeath&quot; meaning that when a character
      loses all it's HP and falls they're gone forever. This can restrict you from

      paths to take to get to your objective.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/562290/extras/story.png?t=1569260879"

    review: 'Good concept but there''s only need for 3 characters in total - The Shield,
      The Shooter, and The Double Jumper. Reducing the number of characters would
      have greatly simplified the game. Overall, the game is extremely buggy plus
      you will never finish it because after a certain progress through levels, the
      game just starts crashing. You''ll never go beyond that point. This game can
      be resurrected if the developer gets back on it and works on some of the feedback
      from players. But the developer has been absent there from the start.


      DON''T BUY THIS GAME! DON''T EVEN PLAY IT FOR FREE! It will give you a headache.'
