There are various puzzles, which can be played as easier Match 3 puzzles if you wish.   So far the puzzles appear to be of medium difficulty.   There is an easy travel map which I used often.\n\nI recommend this game for adventure lovers and puzzle lovers.  There may be some parts things which are hard to find but the guide helped me to find them.  I plan on completing this game and getting all of the collectibles and achievements.","timestamp_created":1597845322,"timestamp_updated":1597845322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkZfAg/QCcKK3nAI="}
