I especially like the upgrade mechanic where taking permanent upgrades makes you weaker for a short time. This way you always have to keep in mind the long term and short term implications of taking an upgrade. \nThe bullets and patterns are always clearly distinguishable, never had problems with that. Only major complaint I have, is the lacking soundscape as there are very few sound effects in relation to what's going on on the screen, which feels very odd.\n\nIf you're looking for a shmup that's a little bit out of the ordinary, give Rheum a go.","timestamp_created":1583399376,"timestamp_updated":1583399376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyKL91PACe5Ga9gE="}
