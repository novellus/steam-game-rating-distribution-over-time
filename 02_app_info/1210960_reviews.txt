The One with the 6 Colours and the 54 Squares, remember?\nNo, no, you don`t have to turn Rows to get one Colour on each side, no, you just have to …click!\nIt is simple. Click on one Square and it Changes. Simple, huh? Well, no. Because the Squares next to the clicked one,are changing, too.  Oh and did i meantion that it is a Cube?\nYou can easily turn around that Cube in every Direction. So clicking a Square at the Border will also change the Square on the next Side. Oh yes.\n\nYour primary Object is to get them all to a special colour. Easy to learn, but hard to master. \nYou can do it 2 Ways. \nFirst: Wild clicking in hope to get it solved.\nSecond: Logical Thinking.\nYeah, the first one can lead to the wished Result, but can also be frustrating. Better not.\nI prefer the Second but it also mean, that you have to take your Time and think … in Rooms.  All can be done in a few Clicks, if you do it the right way. \n\nOh and if one Cube is not enough, you can also try Hyper Cube. 2 Cubes and clicking on one changes Squares on both. Happy braining, dear Reader.\nIf two and even one Cube is too much, you can choose the 2D Way. Just 9 Squares.\nA Cube is annoying for you? No Problem, you can also have the form of a Window, a ball or a Star. A Sandclock? Or even a Skull? Your Choice.\n2 Colours are to easy? You can go up to 6 Colours. And yes, you can also change the size.\nIt is really amazing how many Levels you have to solve.\nAnd if this is not challenge enough, there is also a Clickcounter. Solve it in less Clicks and you get 3 Stars. If you need too much clicks you will get two or just one Star. \nTo get all the Achievements you have to get all 3 Stars.\nThank God there is no timer. That would give your Brain a Final Fatality.\n\nOh, i forgot to mention. You can change the Background and choose one of many animated Features for it. So amazing beautifull, that cannot be described, that have to be seen.\nAnd not to forget the really wonderfull Soundtrack.\n\nYes, dear Reader, we have a really rare Pearl in the Ocean of Games here. \nThere is nothing i don´t like. A technical simple but really challenging Game in a beautifull Area with wopnderfull music. Easy and well fit fully Mouse Control, you can also use keys, and that all for a fair price for what you get. \nFor me it is a near Perfect Game and it is in Early Access, so there is more to come.\nYou want a real Challenge? Then this is for you.\n\nI also want to thank the Developer. I was heartly suprised as he wrote me after he saw my comment under a review, that \ni´am lightly colour blind. \nYeah you can laugh, a Wyvern that sees no colour, hohoho. \nFun aside, i have my Problems with some mixed colours. I´am able to see and knowing the Main Colours. Anyway the Developer saw my comment and for the next update he put in Symbols and other options for People like me.\nFrom reading my comment to implent the new Options only 3 Days were gone.\nThat is an really amazing gesture. I thank you so very, very much for beeing so kind. \nI really like that Game and now i can enjoy it.\nA big, big Thanks.\n\nAnd Thank you, dear Readers for Reading.\n","timestamp_created":1598716393,"timestamp_updated":1598716393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.662310779094696045","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1598734615,"developer_response":"Your review is absolutely incredible!\nWords can not describe how much I thank you for your honest, positive and astonishing detailed review of my game.\nI really appreciate what you did here.\n\nSo thank you very much and have fun with my first brain teasing Steam game!"}],"cursor":"AoJ44oa7nfQCc5zGngI="}
