    review: 'this is a somewhat "lame" game: at one point, the mechanical device showing
      years stops and disappears and the screen on the device shows "error" on each
      and every scene you want to enter. Second, the HINT buttons miraculously stops
      helping you, with no obvious reason for the player.

      The story about "sparkly creatures", looking like fireflies has not been resolved.
      I haven''t grasped how to get rid of them.'
