    review: 'Music is beautiful & puzzles were okay, but the pacing is too slow. While
      you can put together the gist of the story & background lore off of watching
      the cutscenes, having all the dialogue in the robot language keeps you somewhat
      disengaged & confused for as much time as the slow & unskippable cutscenes take
      place. The dialogue does translate to english (each of the robot language characters
      corresponds to a different letter of the English alphabet), however thats only
      if youre willing to take the time to manually decipher it yourself. The game
      having a mode to switch this would keep players a bit more interested & engaged
      for the cutscene time between puzzles.


      Very easy to 100%. Also, there is a 100% walkthrough in the guides section that
      does have the language translated if you wish to read along with that as you
      play.'
