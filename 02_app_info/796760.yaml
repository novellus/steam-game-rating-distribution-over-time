    review: "[H1]Warning: Game doesn't work well on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nThis game\
      \ does NOT load up on your Oculus Rift headset by default (does render to desktop).\
      \ You have to do a Windows 7 compatibility fix to get this game working on the\
      \ Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Unfortunately, that messes up the game.\
      \ The scales end up messed up and you have a fishbowl effect. So while playing\
      \ this game you will feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters ... load up\
      \ on the Dramamine and good luck with that. \n\nAnyways, I got this on sale\
      \ for $1.39 USD and I can't get a refund because I waited too long to play it.\
      \ You do need a room-scale setup. Don't waste your money on the Oculus Rift\
      \ unless you're okay with the fishbowl effect ... mad props to you if you do.\n\
      \n[b]Rate ??? / 10. It looks like a good game. I can't play it so I can't rate\
      \ it. Therefore, I don't feel right giving it a negative review. You've been\
      \ warned![/b]"
