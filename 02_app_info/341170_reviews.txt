If you love Megaman or Metroid, you'll love this game too. It feels like a 90's platformer with a 90's-esque art style.  \n\nThough most people will probably play the ~6-7 hour campaign and move on, there are a few difficulty modes and challenge runs that can probably let you squeeze out another 15 hours if you want to see more. The skill ceiling is high too: some moves cancel one-another, and there are tons of fun movement abilities you gain throughout your playthrough. The story is also surprisingly enjoyable, though I don't want to spoil anything. \n \nThe inflation mechanic is fresh, though it sometimes feels awkward to play around people, as they may get the wrong idea. \n\nOverall, this game is worth your time.","timestamp_created":1609866844,"timestamp_updated":1609866844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9tLi6fYCe4fhwAI="}
