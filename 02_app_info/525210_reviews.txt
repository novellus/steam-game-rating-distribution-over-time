At least there are several movement options, and the archery mechanic feels good, but that's all the positives I can think of.\n\nThe dungeon is just rectangular connections and the enemies zigzag to rush you (even the huge minotaur ones) which doesn't fit with what mass they should have. Even when firing directly where an enemy is running, after you release your arrow they can course correct and dodge it which is fine for a small goblin but an ogre shouldn't have that dexterity. When playing stealthily and using the decoys it is super satisfying to land a sneak headshot because there is no aim assist or path tracing, but once you miss here we go time for QCQ trying to fling as many arrows as possible. There is no snap turning so when you get surrounded you have to physically spin around while flailing to draw arrows which there is a good chance of them dodging even at point blank. The campaign says \"more levels coming soon!\" of course...\n\nSkyrim VR is a much MUCH better version of exactly what this was trying to go for, but that game has so much more as well, so don't waste your time on this.","timestamp_created":1595185968,"timestamp_updated":1595185968,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuMaftPMCf4qrlgI="}
