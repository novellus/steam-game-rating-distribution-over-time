      \ on trial, accused of a brutal murder. How far will you go to exonerate yourself?\

      bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2><strong>Gameplay in Bohemian Killing is a combination\
      \ of a courtroom drama, and a walking simulator. It can be classified as a first\
      \ person experience, or a first person interactive story adventure game.</strong><br><br>The\
      \ story is set within two time frames. In the present, you find yourself locked\
      \ up in the courtroom. You're getting acquainted with the evidence, witness\
      \ testimony and questions posed by the Judge. Each question triggers a flashback\
      \ - and begins your testimony. During the flashback you find yourself in a Parisian\
      \ district, with each of your decisions, interactions and action affecting Alfred\
      \ Ethons' testimony and the final verdict.<br><br>To help you in your testimony,\
      \ you'll have access to all the evidence gathered on the case - expert opinions,\
      \ reports and witness testimonies. Each of them can be (but doesn't have to\
      \ be!) refuted in a number of different ways.<br><br>In the <i>Evidence</i>\
      \ menu you can familiarize yourself with testimonies of witnesses, forensic\
      \ expertises, physical evidences, etc. They are grouped into appropriate categories,\
      \ making them easy to find.<br><br><i>Sample:</i><br>A neighbor testified that\
      \ at approximately 10 p.m. he passed you in the entrance of the tenement house,\
      \ noticing that your clothes were covered in blood? Try testifying that your\
      \ neighbor lies and prove that he has a reason to do so. Or maybe you'll get\
      \ into a bar fight just a few minutes before, so that you can testify that the\
      \ blood the neighbor saw was yours, and not the victim's? Or maybe you will\
      \ cut yourself while shaving, covering your clothes with blood that the neighbor\
      \ sees later? But what if the court finds your time of shaving conspicuous and\
      \ torments you with even more questions? How will you get out of this?<br><br>With\
      \ a wide range of possibilities that can lead to several standard endings and\
      \ one additional hidden one, the game doesn't consider any path &quot;a bad\
      \ one&quot;, ensuring that each playthrough will be different.<br><br><strong>To\
      \ adjust the game to the preferences of each player, two modes are available:</strong><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In the <i>Standard</i> mode, the outcome depends entirely\
      \ on your creativity and ability to solve logical problems. You will suffer\
      \ the consequences of your own actions.<br></li><li>In the <i>Story</i> mode,\
      \ your attorney will advise you as you progress along, commenting on your decisions\
      \ and choices, preventing you from acting in a way that might prove to be harmful\
      \ in the eyes of the court. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VOICE ACTING</h2>The\

    short_description: Paris, 1894. Class differences and pervasive racism finally
      lead to a tragedy. A year later you find yourself on trial, accused of a brutal
      murder. How far will you go to exonerate yourself? Will you lie? Manipulate
      the evidence? Frame others? Act insane? Confess? Your imagination is the limit.
