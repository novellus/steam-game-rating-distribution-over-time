    review: 'This expansion is a 7/10 for me. I''ve played the main game a ton and
      bought this to keep myself surprised. Overall like most of the reviews state,
      it does add more content. Though there isn''t a TON of new content. this being
      a 5$ DLC, it is appropriately priced. I enjoy the foreign aid packages a ton,
      and I think its a great idea, though I believe it would do players who bought
      the expansion good if there were more units or choices for weapons. It draws
      a strange line between "Is this DLC supposed to add a harder mode to the game
      to challenge players?" and "I can''t tell if this was added just to be an expansion
      for new content." Most of this is pretty bias but i felt like MNB2 kept the
      feeling of surprise alive by adding tons of blitz waves and new units you could
      get and don''t get me wrong, this DLC adds a TON of enemy units and i''ve yet
      to discover them all, though it just doesn''t feel like a DLC to me; it feels
      more like a major update.


      Overall, this isn''t bad at all. though it just doesn''t feel like a DLC.'
