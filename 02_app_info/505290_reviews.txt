The game may not be super complex or anything, but god damn it is so much fun to play. The controls are smooth, the mechanics well develpoed, and the gameplay is fantastic. I highly recomend this game to anyone with a few freinds who wants to kick back and have a whole lot of fun","timestamp_created":1484697247,"timestamp_updated":1484697247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487531691789627075","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40cO219kCet/vbw=="}
