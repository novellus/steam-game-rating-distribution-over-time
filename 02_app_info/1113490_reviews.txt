It’s calming, it’s challenging, and it’s definitely rewarding. This is the perfect game to unwind from a particularly stressful video game or after a long day at work. If you even remotely enjoy video games and are looking for something different and wholesome, River Legends: A Fly Fishing Adventure is definitely a trophy catch.","timestamp_created":1577767928,"timestamp_updated":1583545970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493918716907501221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1b2s2fACcoDI6AE="}
