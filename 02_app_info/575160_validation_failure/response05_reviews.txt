Your own playermodel is always visible, weapons and environments are highly detailed. Now this would clearly be a compliment, if most of the assets created were actually made by the developer / designer in question, which I can confirm are clearly [b]NOT.[/b]\n\n[b]Unfortunately, more than half of this game was built from ground up copy-&-paste assets bought from the Unity Asset Store.[/b] Now as I have explained multiple times before, the use of assets from such a store per se is absolutely no problem to me, yet I cannot and will not give appreciation to something someone just took and put into their project without any alteration. This is not the way a template is supposed to be used, in my opinion.\n\n[quote=Enix][...]While [b]pre-created templates are an easy way to circumvent difficult design work[/b], they are merely [b]meant as a foundation[/b], a basis to develop your unique artstyle and/or design on and not leech off of it (like it is currently happening all over Steam Greenlight[, which Art of Stealth was voted through]).[/quote]\n\nSource:\n[url=https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/9901]Prelude Assets[/url]\n[url=https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/?_escaped_fragment_=/content/57210#!/content/57210]Mission 1 Assets[/url]\n[url=https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/8429]Bonus Mission Assets[/url]\n\nApart from all this, there are [b]some visual bugs[/b] existent in the game, which need immediate fixing.\n\n[h1][b][u]Music & Sound[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nApart from the soundtrack of the menu, which fits the whole stealth theme in a \"Mission Impossible\"-esque vibe, [b]the rest of the score is surprisingly lackluster.[/b] Common orchestral tunes and choirs fail to convey or underline any sense of emotion and/or gameplay and are mostly put on loop or just played once, leaving you with awkward silence for the rest of the level. \n\n[b]Weaponsounds and ambient effects are fitting. On the other hand, nothing really stands out.[/b] Enemies scream ridiculously loud when they die and dead bodies still emit audible footsteps. Some interactions are followed by an unexplicably loud and unfitting chime, many other actions have no audio feedback at all.\n\n[b]Voice acting, my favorite! Very inconsistent.[/b] Some parts have actual voice acting, nothing impressive unfortunately, yet other parts feature simple playback by text-to-speech machines. Overall, shallow and nothing worthy of note here. Moving on!\n\n[h1][b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nAs mentioned above, [b]the name is NOT the game.[/b] I grew up with titles such as \"Thief - The Dark Project\" and the early \"Splinter Cell\" series and I can wholeheartedly state that Art of Stealth has nothing in common with other stealth games.\n\n[u][b]The game does not seem to reward you for trying to choose a stealthy approach to a mission.[/b][/u] Most of the time, a stealthy approach to a mission is not even possible, since the enemies seem to be programmed to know where you are from the start (at least in some parts) and simply follow the quickest route to your position.\n\n[b]Detection by the enemy is ridiculously easy and unfairly towards players, which either never played such a title before or even stealth veterans like me.[/b]\n\n[b]Ultimately, this almost always leads down to the player being forced to kill enemies instead of being able to avoid them completely.[/b] And, in my opinion, stealth is exactly [b]NOT[/b] this. As Lambert in Splinter Cell - Pandora Tomorrow stated: \"[...][u]Your gun should always be your last resort. Invisibility is your best weapon.[/u]\" A clear flaw in game design for me.\n\n[b]The story,[/b] if you would like to call it a story, [b]is a run-of-the-mill hunted good-guy-turned-villain story who escaped prison to perform a stealthy burglary and hop the border in order to escape the law.[/b] Uncreative to say the least, given that nothing seems to make me feel a shred of empathy towards the protagonist.\n\n[h1][b][u]Weakpoints[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nWhere should I start? Let's begin with my [b][i]\"false advertising\"[/i][/b] claim.\n\nGiven the description from the store, the customer is supposed to [i]\"face heart-wrenching decisions\"[/i] which will help the protagonist [i]\"evolve as you play!\"[/i]. [b]There are neither of those things.[/b] You decide to kill or to be killed. There is no form of progression that lets you improve the protagonists abilities.\n\n[i]\"You will be able to stick to the cover of darkness[...]\"[/i] [b]Again, this is not the case. There seem to be no clearly defined areas that are shrouded in darkness and are keeping you safe from being seen.[/b] In fact, most of all the areas you visit are brightly lit up.\n\n[i]\"From placing decoys to special takedowns, you can use all of these and many other powerful trick to pursue and eliminate your enemies with great results.\"[/i] You know the deal, right? [b]None of that is possible in the Art of Stealth.[/b] You can shoot or die. If time runs out, you die too. That is it.\n\n[b]A multitude of bugs is still present.[/b] Some assets have a clear bloom / shine effect on them, despite it being the middle of the night. The player and enemy models are overexposed in parts of the game. When day turns to night in one mission, the lighting stays as if it was clear day. A nightvision-goggles overlay does not seem to affect the playermodel itself. You can use bullet time as long as you want. Changing options decreases your final score. I could go on, but you should get the idea - [b]this game is nowhere near \"bug-free\" as the developers want it to be.[/b]\n\n[b]The total playthrough time varies between 20 minutes and 40 minutes. Art of Stealth relies on multiple playthroughs without actually giving good incentives to do so,[/b] resulting in a [b]total playtime of two (2) hours max.[/b]\n\nArt of Stealth also suffers from the \"Call of Duty-difficulty problem\", where [b]upping the difficulty of the game only increases the damage enemies dish out.[/b] Given this is supposed to be a stealth game, [b]this should not be the case.[/b] Instead, [u]there should be alterations in enemy movement, behaviour and player punishment upon detection as well, which, as far as I have seen, seems not to be the case.[/u]\n\nOverall, [b]it seems entirely unclear to me what the game actually wants to achieve.[/b] The title and description states that Art of Stealth wants you to be a stealthy player, avoiding combat whenever possible, while on the other hand, [u]the gameplay is mostly contrary to the stated above and disregards what the game actually wants to be.[/u]\n\n[h1][b][u]Concluding Thoughts[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[i]Art of Stealth is not the game it wants to be. It seems like it missed the topic. While the gameplay loosely touches on some stealth aspects, the general possiblity of actually executing stealthy maneuvers is just completely missing.\n\n[u]Rebuild Art of Stealth from the ground up (with your own assets!). Reward the stealth approach. Fix the numerous bugs I listed. Make the story coherent and plausible. Be consistent and creative with your design. Find more ways to drive a story by showing and less by telling. Correct your description. And most importantly... improve your PR. There is no shame in accepting your wrongdoings. I could respect anyone more who accepts his mistakes and/or weaknesses.[/u]\n\nGiven that and the false advertising that is taking place, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you, dear customer, are seriously looking for a good stealth game, you need to check out other games such as [b]\"Mark of the Ninja\", the \"Splinter Cell\" series or the \"Thief\" series.[/b] These games are what I would consider [u]genuine stealth games[/u] (sorry, if I didn't name your favorite one).[/i]","timestamp_created":1484673444,"timestamp_updated":1484673819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631904363632202148","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l5Td1tkCftDsbw=="}
