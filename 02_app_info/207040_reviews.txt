I bought it in 2011 played few hours then completely forgot it nearly 10 years. I didnt remember how was the game play and why I was so curious that why I dont remember the game since I usually really like sidescroll shoot em ups. So I downloaded it again.\n\n+ The gameplay is actually really colourfull. Power ups, special weapon, time slow mechanism, temporary shield and life-time gain with every hit, it gives more than an average sidescroll shoot em up.\n+ Graphics are shining. I mean really. Even after 10 years I can say that they done an excellent job with design, depth and details. You dont get bored with visuals even if you play same level hundreds of times.\n\n-\tThe problem with the game starts with its atmosphere.  It is dull. Overdose! and I realized that that made me get bored and forget the game easily. There is nothing in the game that pulls you in that world.  The game makes you feel like story is someting and the game play is something else. Makes you feel irrelevant, like “playing flappybird clone to pass the level and in order to learn the what happens next in the visual novel” or like “Bejewlled style matching the colours in order to kill the dragon and recue the princess”\n-\tSoundracks are also colourless. I mean for a shoot em up I always expect some aggressive, joyful or rocking music at the background in order to pull me more in the game and provoke me to shoot more aggressively… Unfortunately there is none. It is more like flying and shooting in the bliss until some Hungarian sentences start.\n-\tThird part the voice acting. Ok I cannot speak Hungarian but voice acting feels like some 3rd class dubbing for some C+ movies. You can find no excitement, no energy, no atmosphere in it. Furthermore after a while it bomes annoying like static.\n\nAre you a shoot em up collector? Definitely buy it. But if you are a gamer who wants some action and excitement, dont buy it.\n\n@Developers: Duraaak, good graphics, Duraaak, good play, Duraaak, Hire some good voice actors next time, Duraaak. \n","timestamp_created":1606744254,"timestamp_updated":1606744254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4/TajPYCdfPqtQI="}
