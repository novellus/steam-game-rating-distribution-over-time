    review: well let's see the game I liked for the most part but I was concerned
      about pablo being dragged behind I.R.I.S did deliver one line humor like references
      without knowing the meaning the game is very short it can be played within 2
      hours at most it is 17 levels long it can be replayed again but the fact that
      pablo didn't speak English well there was the fact that I.R.I.S couldn't translate
      pablo's voice due to her voice translator module was unavailable however I did
      laugh on the references in the game there was some movie and TV references as
      well that isn't so subtle I was able to get the references quickly early on
