You're supposed to be a blind girl but the way you see feels more like you're on drugs than your blind character giving images to sounds and you're always running and jumping everywhere...\n\n[b][u]Gameplay :[/u][/b] There's a weird mechanic that enables you to \"see\" where you're going... but it's done horribly. Some strokes of colour appear around objects when you get close enough to things or when there are sounds next to them ( for exemple when you throw the cute hamsters to walls ). But these strokes of colour are often just chaotic and personally they gave me a headache. At first it was okay, because you're next to the sea, there's a lot of wind=noise and everything is easy to see when you get closer. But then it's all dark, the said strokes appear out of nowhere and disappear just as fast. Sometimes you see something really far ( go figure ) and when you try to reach it you bump into a huge wall. You'll get lost a lot, you will never be completely sure of where you are. There are some parts with enemies where I got stuck and the solution was (maybe?) to just go around ? But again, it's so horrible to find your way in this game that I ended up just jumping and running everywhere until I made it.\nWhat annoyed me the most was that it would seem like you could go somewhere ( like a huge forest on the side of the road ), but if you tried, it would get all buggy ( which made me feel even more sick ) and I would get kinda stuck and had to jump and run sightless until I either found my way back to the working map or was killed by the game for going too astray.\n\n[b][u]Achievements :[/u][/b] ~2h to unlock them all with a guide, much more on your own.\nSome will unlock for no reason, for exemple I got the \"stand still for 30secondes\" just by starting the game and \"Complete the game in under 30 minutes\" even though I took much more time. There are two grindy achievements : \"Drown 50 mokos\" ( the hamsters ) and \"Throw 1000 mokos\"... This is going to take some time, it's just sad to think it will take you more time to finish this than to finish the game. And finally, the collectibles... there are little blue lights hidden in the game, 50 to be exact and this is a nightmare. Because of the epileptic lights I really didn't want to explore and still tried and still only got half of them. There are places where you technically can go but it feels like you weren't supposed to and sometimes you even have to commit suicide to get out of there... the problem is, if you are used to hidden collectibles you're going to look in every corner, but here I would often lose a lot of time getting somewhere for nothing, add to that the fact that's it's horrible to keep track of where you are and where you're going and you'll end up running in circles going mad.\n\n[b][u]Another game with the same theme I recommend playing instead of this:[/u][/b] \"Beyond eyes\" which is a pretty and nice slow game and \"A Blind Legend\" where you actually navigate only using sound.","timestamp_created":1562083439,"timestamp_updated":1598731536,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586871027946472168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Oj0nfQCfrrvygE="}
