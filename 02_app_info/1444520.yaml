      Tribal Hunter is an action platformer. You play as a village guardian who can\

      \ grow, you can use this 'growth' as energy to fire projectiles at enemies!<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player hunts enemies and can eat them to increase their\
      \ fullness meter. If you eat enough, you will grow in size! Your size and fullness\
      \ then also functions as a magic meter that you can spend for various effects\
      \ like healing yourself or casting powerful magic like fireball!<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nBecoming bigger has both pros and cons. Your punch will become much\
      \ more powerful at larger sizes along with increased damage resistance from\
      \ your bouncy full body! However, becoming bigger also means you are a bigger\
      \ target for enemies to hit. Also, certain types of enemy attacks are piercing,\
      \ dealing extra damage to your full tight body, so be careful!"
