      /><br><strong>MULTIPLAYER</strong><br>We've always wanted to experience this
      style of RPG with a few friends. With that in mind, Isles of Adalar will support
      up to four player co-op on release. However, we know multiplayer isn't for everyone
      so we will manually scale the difficulty of every encounter to keep the integrity
      of the single player game design. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1112620/extras/ModSupportGif.gif?t=1603407432"
      /><br><strong>MOD SUPPORT</strong><br>Our vision is for Isles of Adalar to become
      known over time as a nearly endless RPG experience rich with narrative driven
      content. With this in mind we've designed our game to support mods and user
      generated content from the very beginning. Everything that exists in game is
      created using the same level editor that ships inside the game, so the modders
      have access to all the tools we use ourselves to create campaigns. <br><br>Just
      shipping tools for modding is not enough to realize our vision. We are going
      to be actively working to build up a creative community around our game. This
      starts with making tools as user friendly and efficient to use as possible so
      that small teams of only a handful of people can make large scale campaigns.
      But in addition to the tools we will also be giving players extra content that
      is not used in the base game so that their campaigns can feel unique. This will
      range from environmental biomes, to different styles of architecture and even
      new enemies.<br><br><strong>ROLE PLAYING AND REPLAYABILITY</strong><br>Choice
      and consequence is at the core of our dialogue system. We use a hybrid (mostly)
      text based system that features non specific voice lines for NPCs. This allows
      us to have in depth dialogue with the characters in the world but also gives
      the player necessary feedback to reflect the NPC's general attitude and response
      to the player. For example, you may try to intimidate a bandit and if you fail
      the speech check you may get a voiced response saying something like &quot;I
      won't stand for this!&quot; but the text can be more in depth and context specific.<br><br>Instead
      of using a speech skill to determine dialogue choices and persuasion success,
      the player can assign multiple personality traits to their character and these
      traits will give unique responses. The success or failure of a persuasion attempt
      is determined by both the player character's level and if a specific type of
      persuasion logically makes sense in the context of the situation.

    review: 'Do you like the sounds of overly loud squishy foot steps? How about the
      look of inexplicable water spots in your vision when  coming out of the water?
      How about carrying a weapon(staff), when stowed that looks like you have like
      two feet of a wood stick pointing out of your midsection?

      I was willing to give this a shot, knowing it''s early access and has a long
      way to go. It''s too early for early access. Visually, this reminds me a lot
      more of Morrowind than Skyrim, but there isn''t really a comparison to either,
      it''s too far behind both. This is in a stage that should only be used for internal
      testing. I didn''t play nearly long enough to see any major bugs, just bad graphics,
      unbalanced environmental sounds, bad implementation of controls(stuck in third
      person for no reason until an npc comes to you, then forced to first person?),
      inexplicable swimming (can''t keep your head above water?), ability to see better
      through water when you aren''t in it than when you are, awful character customization,
      and weird collision with objects that you aren''t next to, and apparently can''t
      be any closer to. Maybe come back in a year or two.'
