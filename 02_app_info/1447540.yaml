    review: 'Enypnion is a short point ''n click adventure game where you have to
      guide Jonathan through his dreamworld... solving puzzles and passing obstacles.
      Travelling through this bizar world might even learn Jonathan a few things about
      himself. I liked this short game... there was something intruiging about these
      sureal locations and bizar encounters. For an indie game by one person it was
      a very polished product. Nice graphics, music and sounds. Puzzles were also
      interesting and well integrated in the story.  recommended!
