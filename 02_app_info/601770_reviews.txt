Like a good 3ft zone where you wont hit anything.\nI still hit my fan a few times when I got really into it.\nIt's a serious work out but it is fun as hell. 10/10 still sweating.\nSpectating is like a game in its own. Really fun having 3 friends and winner tags out and spectates the next game.\nSeriously I love spectating matches waiting to play. 11/10 on that never seen a game make spectating fun.\nLove the customization of your characters. You can be completely unique. 10/10 on that.\n9$ on sale? That's a friggen steal my friends. You are missing out if you have buds that play VR. Get them this game. Play it with them. I guarantee you'll have a good time.","timestamp_created":1609803436,"timestamp_updated":1609803436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/uHw5/YCe9XFwAI="}
