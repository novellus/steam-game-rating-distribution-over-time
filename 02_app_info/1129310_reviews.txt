I wish there were more choices of places to go in each room, different enemies and more reasons for liking a gun more than the other. It is very fun to operate firearms in this game but it would have been better if we could actually shoot the guns more, maybe have another type of enemy that is less menacing and appears in groups for example.","timestamp_created":1610077321,"timestamp_updated":1610077321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48saF8PYCcaG5wQI="}
