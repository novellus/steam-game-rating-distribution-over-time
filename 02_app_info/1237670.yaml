    short_description: Are you the new recruit? Well, grab your weapons and descent
      into battle on distant planets. There you will combat the Alien invasion called
      the Cubicon Conjunction. Waves will hit you so you better blast these invaders
      from the sky before they crash onto your base.How many will you take down?

    review: 'Found this through ModDB, and it certainly is ripe for a mod.  4 things
      you gotta do.  Watch ''High Score'' on Netflix,  Youtube ''Player One - Space
      Invaders'', Fire this baby up, and then watch ''Ready Player One'' on Netflix,
      and the 5th thing is for someone to make a Pixelated Cthulunoid Mod for this
      thing.
