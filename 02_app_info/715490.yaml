    about_the_game: 'Above: The Fallen is a 2D side-scrolling, puzzle - platformer
      game that is centered around travelling upwards instead of to the left or right.
      The goal is to climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to
      break through the canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same
      time throughout the game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark
      forest.<br><br><img src="https://media.st.dl.pinyuncloud.com/steam/apps/715490/extras/lore.png?t=1577205738"
      crossorigin="anonymous"/><br><br>Mankind has been driven from their homes among
      the trees by the Night King, a nightmarish beast whose origin has been lost
      to time. Now, man lives in the dirt, fearing the moments the Night King leaves
      his roost to prey upon their vulnerable forms. <br><br>Every generation the
      elders send a young couple out into the world to find a new home for their people
      where they need not fear the relentless hunger of the Night King. Every generation
      these journeys have failed. This time however, the young couple has decided
      to ascend into the trees and reclaim their ancestral home instead of fleeing
      into the darkness. Can they rise above?<br><br><img src="https://media.st.dl.pinyuncloud.com/steam/apps/715490/extras/mechanics.png?t=1577205738"

      that require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the canopy.
      Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers an additional
      challenge and requires you to think about each character''s positioning before
      moving. If you don''t get the hang of it right away, don''t worry, it won''t
      be long before you''re climbing through the jungle like Tarzan.<br><br><img

    review: "[table][th]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34907518/]Review\
      \ by Games for Lovers[/url] - only GOOD local co-op games!\n[/th][/table]\n\n\
      You want to play something with your significant other?\n\nThen this game MIGHT\
      \ be something for you. Is it a good game? Well, partially. I had fun finishing\
      \ it with my SO, but\n\nit is buggy (but comes with lots of savepoints)\nit\
      \ is short (it still took us some days to finish)\nit is rather easy (don't\
      \ expect a real platforming or puzzle challenge, but we still managed to get\
      \ stuck at one puzzle)\nit is abandoned (at least I could not find the programmers\
      \ to ask for help with abovementioned puzzle)\n\nStill, we enjoyed the game!\n\
      \nYou play a sweet young couple trying to climb the trees of an ancient forest\
      \ in order to break through the canopy to find a new home for your poor people\
      \ (in the clouds?). The game is strictly co-op. While you can officially play\
      \ both characters with one gamepad, this is simply not as much fun as playing\
      \ together. \n\nYou will encounter easy platforming and mostly easy puzzles,\
      \ often using some of the special abilities your characters will learn during\
      \ their journey. There are enemies, but not many. Perfect for a stress-free\
      \ gaming session with your SO!\n\nWorks fine with XBox 360 gamepads.\n\n[u][b]\
      \ Conclusion:[/b][/u]\nNice (and affordable) co-op game for couples, despite\
      \ all its shortcomings."
