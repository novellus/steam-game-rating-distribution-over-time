    review: "This game....\nwas clearly written by someone whose only knowledge of\
      \ college is from what they could see from their car window on vacation to Disney\
      \ World during Spring Break in 1996. \nThey have no idea how to actually talk\
      \ to WAMAN \nAnd they attempt to be feminist but its actually misguided misogyny\
      \ from someone whose only knowledge of feminist theory comes from bad porn videos.\
      \ \nAlso why do all the girls have foreheads bigger than my dreams? \nI can't\
      \ figure out how to see one (1) titty \nand all the inner monologues are hella\
      \ creepy and I hope this guy stays a beta cuck forever \nP.S. Developer is a\
      \ virgin"
