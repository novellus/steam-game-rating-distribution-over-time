    short_description: The Jinko rugby club's training camp has begun. As the team
      engages in intense practice, a lone man appears and tells them they're wasting
      their time. The harsh words of former national team coach Komori Shingo leave
      the team at a loss. Meanwhile, Sekizan asks him what the team is lacking.
