    review: I thought it was fun. It did seem a bit rough, as if it were a bit amatuerish,
      but still a fun little game. Some of the levels are frustrating and you have
      to be careful where you place your units. You actually have to pick the spot
      where they are stangind and if you are a bit too far away from one path or another
      they won't be in range.
