    reviews: "\u201CKine is an intensely entertaining and challenging puzzler dripping\
      \ with charm. It has bags of character and will have you smiling from start\
      \ to finish. I can\u2019t say much more than do yourself a favour and buy this\
      \ game.\u201D<br />\r\n10/10 \u2013 TheXboxHub<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CCrazy\
      \ as they may seem, it's these musical dreamers that ensure Kine makes your\
      \ heart skip as your head rings!\u201D<br />\r\n9/10 \u2013 Edge Magazine<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CIt all adds up to a deceptively delicious package, and\
      \ a generous one too - there are loads of levels to take on. Kine, like a Magic\
      \ Eye puzzle, is much more than it initially seems.\u201D<br />\r\nRecommended\
