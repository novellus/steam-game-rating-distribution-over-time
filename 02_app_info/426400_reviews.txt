I don't have a single complaint for this movie. Great story and setting, fantastic acting, great special effects that have aged well and an awesome soundtrack (please sell this as a movie DLC). Well worth a watch and I can easily say it's worth the $10.99 asking price.","timestamp_created":1534552394,"timestamp_updated":1534552559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.636553704738616943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42bmdpeUCdpXXqAE="}
