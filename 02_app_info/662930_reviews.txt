I'm not too far into it so I don't know how deep the strategy goes, but it looks promising.\n\nHowever one major complaint is that the ENTIRE thing is SO DAMN SMALL!!  \"TinyRTS\" should not mean that you make tiny UI!  It is crazy hard on the eyes.  There is so much wasted screen real estate.  My only guess it is that way because of more complex and advanced levels I have not got to yet.  The game REALLY needs a zoom, but it probably goes deeper than that.  \n\nOtherwise, cool sounds, cool tactics, cool upgrades and I like the real-time mechanic.","timestamp_created":1600988190,"timestamp_updated":1600988190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw06KV4fQCeZPsowI="}
