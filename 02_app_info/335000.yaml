    short_description: TORMENTUM is a dark Point &amp; Click adventure game.The dreamlike,
      nightmarish atmosphere of the game was inspired by works of painters H.R. Giger
      and Zdzislaw Beksinski. The game's final look and feel was also strongly influenced
      by the universes of games such as Demon's Souls or Dark Seed.

    review: "BottomLine at the Top:  I give a somewhat reluctant endorsement for the\
      \ P&C aficionado to try this one out.   \n\nIntro:\nI had some reservations\
      \ about this one at first.  As a big Giger fan obviously the art style drew\
      \ me in.  But I can usually smell a Hidden Object game from a mile away and\
      \ this one\u2019s game play style trailers was setting off my detector.  Fortunately,\
      \ it was not an outright H.O. game but keep in mind this was designed for smartphone\
      \ gaming and thus has that kinda app-y game feel to it.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\
      Pros\n-------------------------------------\n-Art style can be summed up with\
      \ \"WTF...\".  Detailed and great for fans of H.R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksinski.\n\
      -Atmospheric Soundtrack.\n\n-------------------------------------\nMeh...\n\
      -------------------------------------\n-I wish people would hand me objects\
      \ instead of throwing them on the ground for me to pick up.  This is enough\
      \ of a problem for me in real life I do not need it going on in game ( /s ;)\
      \ )\n-Autosave Only.\n-No interaction icon bar.  As a lover of classic P&C games\
      \ this is a little disappointing but it\u2019s not a requirement for a decent\
      \ P&C either.  \n-Game flow is relatively good but overall puzzles and gameplay\
      \ elements feel simplistic at times.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\
      Cons\n-------------------------------------\n-Short game considering its price.\
      \  I have shied away from making judgements on game price as all games are ultimately\
      \ up to the buyer to determine if they got their money\u2019s worth or not.\
      \  That being said my total game play came in at around 2 1/2 hours and had\
      \ I bought the game at its regular asking price of $12 I personally would have\
      \ been unhappy.\n-I didn't realize this game had more than one ending until\
      \ it was too late.  As its only autosave this was disappointing. Relating to\
      \ the first con above, to me it is a faux pas to rely on replaying to \"get\
      \ all the endings\" as a substitute for substantive game play time.  The game\
      \ was alright, but I wasn\u2019t so enthralled that I'm gona go back and replay\
      \ most of the same scenes just to see a different ending.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\
      \nOverall, you buy this primarily for the crazy artwork and macabre atmosphere.\
      \ The gameplay itself is lacking and to me it was overpriced for the total game\
      \ play time.  That being said if you are looking for a quick afternoon jaunt\
      \ in a demon infested hellhole of a world and do not want to head over to the\
      \ DMV to get your fill, this game is a decent option if you can find it on a\
      \ good sale.\n\n\n\nFor more point and click goodness, check out our P&C fan\
