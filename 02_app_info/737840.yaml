    about_the_game: GYROCUBE is a Virtual Reality and Mobile puzzle game, that invites
      everyone to participate in a global challenge; solve the cubes as fast as possible!
      The game is based on the traditional physical cube puzzles loved by many, that
      however has failed to inspire a strong and original digital experience - Until
      now!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><i>Features</i></strong></h2><strong>Contains
      the most popular cube configurations</strong> (2x2x2,3x3x3,4x4x4, and 5x5x5)
      - There's a cube for everyone! <strong>Series Mode</strong> is also available,
      that requires you to solve all 4 cubes as quickly as possible, in order to compete
      on the Series Mode Leaderboard.<br><br><strong>Personal Statistics and Global
      Leaderboards!</strong> Show your friends that you are better and faster than
      them! Compete to be part of the Top 4 - and you'll let everyone world-wide see
      your time to beat.<br><br>The cubes can be customised in a variety of colours,
      such as traditional cube puzzle colour schemes, color blind mode, etc!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Community
      Driven Design</strong></h2>The entire design process has involved the Cubing
      community quite heavily. This has been through open feedback sessions, closed
      beta tests, and others. The entire project was driven by the cubing community
      and their excitement about the possibility to solve and interact with the cube
      puzzles in a new and fresh way, whilst also only requiring them to have access
      to their phone. <br>The game invites everyone to try a couple of cubes for free,
      whilst providing them tools to see their progression as they become better,
      whilst also giving them a chance to have their name appear in everyone elses
      game on the leaderboard.

    review: "I want this game to be good. I do. There are some issues I have with\
      \ the game. \nFirstly, I am not sure how well the game works on other devices\
      \ but on the Oculus, the actual pointers for the remotes are too far up, and\
      \ my remotes seem to be just fine.\nSecondly, the way you spin the cube is WAY\
      \ too finicky. If you could possibly have some way of holding the cube while\
      \ trying to move your hands without spinning it, like integrating the triggers\
      \ on remotes, that would be nice.\nAlthough these issues are small, I would\
      \ like to point out that this game costed [b]$9.00[/b]. This is a [b]great[/b]\
      \ concept for a virtual reality puzzle game, but when two things that are essential\
      \ to the gameplay are not working, I cannot in a truthful manner recommend this\
      \ game."
