Great art!\n\nProtagonist's characteristic clashed with my own which sometimes annoyed me at certain parts, but I enjoyed the game thoroughly regardless. Rich dialogues and good sense of humors.\n\nCompared to ep 1, story style and theme are different (which you can probably tell what type they would be based on the opening song). Character's personalities stayed consistent though which is very hard to do, but they did it seamlessly.","timestamp_created":1609633745,"timestamp_updated":1609633745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hrnp4vYCeID0vwI="}
