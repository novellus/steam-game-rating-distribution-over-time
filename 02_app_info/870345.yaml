    review: 'if you get past the first three episodes, it starts to get interesting,
      many more characters are introduced and much of the backstory comes into light.


      That said the first three episodes are boring as hell, the combat is dull with
      much action feeling cut out. Only the three main characters have the spotlight,
      there are no villain of merit only local trouble from one pit-stop till the
      next. Oh and a lot of talking.


      I was so bored after the first episode that I almost fell asleep, and after
      the second episode I seeked something else to watch.


      It has the potential to get better with the next season, I''d personally give
      it a 6.5/10.0'
