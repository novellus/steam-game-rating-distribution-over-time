However, there was a good amount of care put into it for the small amount of people who worked on it. It is a COMPLETE game, but it still feels as though it is missing something. It only took maybe an hour or so to beat, it went a lot faster once I realized killing the enemies has no purpose whatosever and you can just run past them. Its got a small story told through found logs, 4 bosses, and maybe 5 weapons.\n\nAll the weapons suck except for 2, the fireball and the rocket. They are slow, clunky, and the accuracy is abysmal which really describes the movement entirely since there's no run button and you walk and jump at such a leisurely pace despite being in mortal danger. \n\nThe enemy variety is relatively high for such a short game, and they are pretty well created as well, however their attacks range from annoying to useless as projectiles are easily dodged. I was not \"worried\" about any of the enemies since they pose little actual threat, just a time sink mostly.\n\nBosses were great! Each had at least 2 attacks, and while they trivially were easy, I really didn't expect this game to have such well done animations and attacks, this is a big plus.\n\nWorld design was good as well, despite the simple pixel palette they used, its enough to signify where you are in the map just by looking at the walls, this was a really good choice and a the overall maze/metroidvania style of how you progress through it was kind of cool. It was just complex enough so you'll remember *most* of the previously inaccessible passages by the time you get a new item to open them.\n\nStory was kind of ehh, I didn't really expect much from this and really didn't get much. Not very compelling but I think that's also a symptom of the meaningless gameplay. The only real progress you get is when you get a new gun, when you die, and god forbid you do, you are reset to the last checkpoint and all enemies respawn. This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't agonizingly long distances apart sometimes.\n\nI will give this game a gold star for being a 100% complete game with all the features a game should have, I ran into no glitches and I was able to complete it and get everything the game had to offer me without too much issue. It's sad that I have to say that because a lot of games that look like this end up being gigantic messes or asset flips, but this is not that. It had a very reasonable scope and accomplished everything it set out to do.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game is that killing enemies doesn't do anything for you other than get them out of the way, in Metroid they would occasionally drop items, in this there is no reason not to run right past them if you are able to. I see that some of the game level features were designed with you having to kill the enemies in mind, I was able to completely ignore these once I realized it was optional. Maybe a score or something?\n\nThis is NOT a bad game for being a crappy quality game, this is a subpar game with a very tiny scope that doesn't do anything wrong, but isn't particularly noteworthy either. For $10, hell no, your money is better spent. However I would pay attention to this dev in the future as this seems like it's their first game and they might improve in another one.","timestamp_created":1609785131,"timestamp_updated":1609785131,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4//eq5/YCdYC8wAI="}
