      \ in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic.\
      \ Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when\
      \ you have some remote work to do too. But don\u2019t freak out. It's all about\
      \ dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for\
      \ one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this\
      \ all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing\
      \ you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise,\
      \ you go insane!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet's find joy too in this frenetic shelter\
      \ simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing\
      \ all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare\
      \ time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor,\
      \ dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the\
      \ fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need\
      \ to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE\
      \ the clock strikes. If you don\u2019t, you go insane, and it\u2019s Game Over.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\u2019s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before\
      \ the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let\u2019s find little\
      \ pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before."
