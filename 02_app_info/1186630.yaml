    review: Poor excuse for a Trpg game, made myself finish it but that was achievement
      in it self. Most anoyoing things would frame rate of a turtle, the cam going
      bonkers, not to metion constat crashes, no mini map, no press x to highlight
      itims on the gorund and ABSOLUTLY no option setting yey sound and music are
      the only options. Again finishing it was a miricale.
