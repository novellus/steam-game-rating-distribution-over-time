This is exactly what I am looking for in a puzzle series; a slow upticking in difficulty that gently drags you into the game but doesn't frustrate you until close to the end.  \n\nOf course, there is some problems; minor ones, but they are still there.  Despite being like Picross, there is no note function or lock that allows you to say \"I think this is a blue hex (equivalent of a bomb in minesweeper) and this other square is a hint hex (which you left click to uncover to see how many surrounding hexes are supposed to be blue)\" or to prevent you from accidentally clicking a hex incorrectly.   That is mostly all I have against the game, so I would say a good series at a good price!","timestamp_created":1609894279,"timestamp_updated":1609894279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49abL6vYCeYLvwAI="}
