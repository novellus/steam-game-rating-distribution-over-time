      \ a lot of style.<br><br>OK, but... what does that mean? Well, <strong>Dynasty\
      \ Feud</strong> is different from other brawlers out there, taking inspiration\
      \ from several genres to offer an experience that is faster, leaner, and a lot\
      \ of fun! <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649290/extras/Game_Features.png?t=1572389497\"\

      \ /><br>In <strong>Dynasty Feud</strong> you won\u2019t pick a character to\
      \ fight, you will pick a whole dynasty formed by 5 of them. The characters are\
      \ your life bar, if you lose all of them, that\u2019s it, you are done. What,\
      \ really? No way! And they die fast, really fast, REALLY REALLY FAST; one hit\
      \ and that character is gone. Yeah, gone. The next character will appear, but\
      \ it will be a totally different one, with its own weaknesses and strengths.<br><br>Value\
      \ your characters and measure your movements carefully. Knowing their capacities\
      \ and how to use them is as important as knowing your enemies. Plus there are\
      \ 40 like this, so... have fun. A miscalculated jump, a surprise burst or missed\
      \ attack can be the difference between death and glory. Uuuhh, that sounded\
      \ serious.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649290/extras/Choose_your_dynasty.png?t=1572389497\"\
      \ /><br>Each character is unique. Each character plays different. Each dynasty\
      \ is special. <br><br>From melee juggernauts to sneaky snipers, along with invisible\
      \ ninjas and a TNT-loving cactus, a true Dynasty Master can adapt to any opponent\
      \ by making the most of each of its family members. <br> <br>Let's see who they\
      \ are shall we...<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649290/extras/Cowboys.png?t=1572389497\"\
      \ /><br> <br>The Cartwrongs are specialized in LONG and MEDIUM RANGE bullet\
      \ attacks. Their key to victory is to keep enemies away by using their zoning\

      \ /><br><br>With a good mix of PROJECTILE, EXPLOSIVES and MELEE, the Fancier's\

      \ /><br><br>The Uurg Aaarg members are a mixed bunch with decent PROJECTILE\
      \ and mid range capacity, as well as some powerful MELEE options. They are hard\
      \ to control, but powerful once you master them.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649290/extras/CavemenStats.png?t=1572389497\"\

      \ /><br><br>The House of Arthur is an exceptionally resilient dynasty, with\
      \ many of its members having shield and armor. They do sacrifice mobility and\

      \ /><br> <br>The People of the Sun's main strength is in their powerful SUPER\
      \ FEUD attack, in which each character gains a special power, coupled with their\
      \ ability to sacrifice themselves to automatically fill the SUPER FEUD meter.<br>\

      \ They spend mind energy to attack, which they then need to recharge. However,\
