    review: CLASSIC 8-bit GAME! Caverns of Karvella is a classic 8-bit platformer
      game originally meant as a project for beginning developers created by Stephen
      Archer. He has taken the project and turned it into a more complete game with
      more levels, enemies, and plenty of other features. Explore through terrifying
      caves finding keys to unlock the door to the next level, collect diamonds and
      gold coins to boost up your score!. In this game there are 3 stages of levels,
      each level gets progressively harder as you battle your way through the Caverns,
      Jumping over spikes and cave monsters can be tricky, SO BE CAREFUL! as you only
      have 3 Lives through each level until its GAME OVER! Can you make your way through
      the Caverns or Karvella and escape?! Will you take on this challenge to become
      the ultimate Karvella explorer!?..
