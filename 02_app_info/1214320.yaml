      /><br><br>In Frog X Log, you must catch as many fly's as possible with your
      abnormally long tongue until a inevitable fatal mistake.<br>Each Fly is colour
      coded and in turn, must be caught with the right colour of tongue.<br>One out
      of three colours is picked every 30 seconds which triggers a tongue colour change,
      for every 10 Fly's picked, the difficulty spikes along with a few surprises.<br>However,
      if you happen to catch a fly with the wrong colour, you will trigger a game
      over and a potential froggy explosion.<br>Simplistic controls are all that are
      required, arrow keys to move and the space-bar to temporarily freeze and stick
      out your tongue.<br><br><strong>Happy Hopping</strong><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1214320/extras/flys.png?t=1586563123"
