      \ up to you to play through a week running her shop!  Cerise is pretty easy-going,\
      \ so sleeping with customers isn't very difficult, but what will you do when\
      \ there are more folks around than you have time to deal with?  They won't all\
      \ stick around forever, and the choices you make will ripple throughout the\
      \ rest of the week.  Or you can just not worry about it \u2014 there are no\
      \ bad endings, and you don't <i>have</i> to make everyone happy.<br><br>But\
      \ watch out \u2014 someone keeps trying to sneak in and ruin everyone's good\

      notes: "This is a sex VN, so there are a lot of explicit illustrations!  If\
        \ you don't like that but you'd still like to read the text (which is mostly\
        \ real dialogue, not narration), there's a Kitten Mode that censors the artwork.\r\

    short_description: Cherry Kisses is a low-pressure visual novel disguised as a
      tiny RPG. Run a sex shop for a week and sleep with your varied cast of customers.
      Satisfying everyone in a single playthrough is a bit of a puzzle, but completely
      optional.
