This game is not labeled as \"early access\" but the developer states in the credits for the game that he plans on adding content over time.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df7Gz0Vstco\n\nNo progression except leveling up, which does nothing except make your spells stronger.  No classes to choose,  No races to choose.  You're a wizard with five spells from the start to the end.  What is here on launch day can be completely beaten in under 30 minutes.  30 minutes with zero replay value is NOT worth $12.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED as the value is way too low for what is offered.  If this game had 5 or 6 hours of content for the $12 asking price, I'd give it my thumbs up.  What is here is worth no more than $2 or $3 on launch day.\n\nI do like the game play and responsive controls however.  If the developer adds about 10x the current amount of content, I will come back and re-review this game and it would likely earn my thumbs up.  (Or dropping the price to about $1.99 would also earn my thumbs up)","timestamp_created":1609283725,"timestamp_updated":1609283808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524269282817840576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsMWy2PYCcfjMvgI="}
