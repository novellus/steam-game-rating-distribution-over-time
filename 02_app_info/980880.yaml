    review: 'It has the goal of 2048 with a bunch of other game mechanics already
      mentioned by other reviews and tags that I added as off my review.


      + Pros

      - Unique gameplay

      - Many unique enemies

      - Many Level Up abilities that makes almost every gameplay different

      - Who''d thought roaring golden tile faces would be so tasty?


      ~ Cons

      - Simple background; while not really a major problem, the gameplay board IS
      rather small but that''s because of the needed additional stuff and acquired
      abilities that come as gameplay progresses. My point is that maybe there could
      be added background skins that could be unlocked somehow.

      - Despite that the trailer video had music, the game itself doesn''t, which
      is a shame.

      - The Achievements look close to impossible! A million points? A billion?! TRILLION?!
      QUINTILLION?!?! No wonder there''s such a low percentage of worldwide completion!
      Sure the screenshots on the game''s store page show possibilities but how can
      anyone possibly be THAT GOOD for the rest, especially with those "You Win" and
      "You Really Win" Achievements?

      - The characters have no names that I''m aware of, which is a shame because
      they all have their own unique trait. Make a list of them and for all 40 abilities.

      - No Trading Cards. Yes, this is obviously my opinion but this game HAS the
      potential to have this feature. Mr. Sun, with all the different characters and
      gimmicks you made for Twinfold, I''m sure you can get the mindset to come up
      images, Steam Profile Badges, Emoticons and Profile Backgrounds for us Steam
      uses to get a little more for our profiles.


      Conclusion, Twinfold really is a good game to play; it''s just a crying shame
      that it''s also just another in the forgotten depths of Steam players'' interest.
      My additional tags put on for the game''s store page isn''t enough; maybe Mr.
      Sun should consider making it better known again if he hasn''t moved on to other
      things...'
