The problem is that this was in the initial early access and now there is no players due to lack of activity from the developers. \nBut...\nThey have recently announced (December 2020) that they are still working on the game and it has taken them longer than expected, which is a relief. I may recommend this game once the new update comes with the marketing push. \nIn short just wait for the 2021 update!","timestamp_created":1606580947,"timestamp_updated":1609614822,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwp6Gh4vYCeL3KtAI="}
