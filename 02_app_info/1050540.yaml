    review: "I don't know what I just played but this is the worst attempt at a knockoff\
      \ Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley game I could have tried. Movement is clunky and\
      \ stilted, items swing the way you're facing, not where you're aiming. And you\
      \ can't turn to face an object if you're touching it. \nThe $3 I spent on this\
      \ was too much, this seems like somebody's high school Game Maker project more\
      \ so than a serious attempt at a commercial game."
