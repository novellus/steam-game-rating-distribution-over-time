      released!!!!</h2><br>Thank you all for being so patient. Please download the
      update and give your feedback on the new track artwork and the new AI system.
      <br>Along with the new artwork and AI have been loads of bug fixes and other
      small improvements. <br><br><strong>Release Notes</strong><br><br><strong>Brand
      new environments</strong><br>The race track artwork has been completely re-done
      from scratch, and uses the latest graphics enhancements such as PBR (Physically
      Based Rendering) to make the game look even more realistic. <br><br><strong>Improved
      truck cosmetics</strong><br>The truck body paint and tyres now used improved
      shaders and look much better in-game. The truck customise screen has also been
      greatly improved.<br><br>You can now also move/rotate the truck around in the
      customise screen. <br><br><strong>In-game multiplayer notifications to get more
      matches</strong><br>Many players complained that they had troubles matching
      people in multiplayer games. <br><br>If you are in the main menu, or in a single
      player race, and somebody in your region opens the game, you will both get a
      'Game found' notification. You have 5 seconds to press ENTER to join this game.
      If both of you do not press ENTER within the 5 seconds, the notification will
      disappear and you will not see another notification in that race. <br><br>If
      you both press ENTER, you will be taken into a multiplayer race. <br><br>Currently
      multiplayer matching will match you with anybody within 10 levels of your player
      level. <br><br>No more sitting on the multiplayer matching screen waiting for
      someone to join!<br><br><strong>Multiplayer sync improvements</strong><br>Multiplayer
      sync has received a complete overhaul, synchronisation of opponents trucks is
      now much smoother and more accurate than it was previously. <br><br><strong>Longer
      content path</strong><br>Previously players were completing the game too quickly,
      so the upgrade path is now more lengthy and costly, and players will need to
      race in multiplayer and daily challenge races to increase their income in order
      to beat the higher level AI opponents in career mode. Remember to drag 4 unique
      cards into empty upgrade slots to get your free upgrades.<br><br><strong>Brand

    review: Arghh.  I'm rarely compelled to leave a review but the interface of this
      game is terrible.  "Partial Controller Support" means you can't do anything
      out side of the actual race with your controller.  I also have a terrible time
      with it letting me select the upgrade cards and drag them into the upgrade slots.  One
      card will select and drag with zero problems... try to select a 2nd different
      card and it will not work until you've tried it like a dozen times.
