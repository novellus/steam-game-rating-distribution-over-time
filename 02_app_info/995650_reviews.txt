Today we will be looking at “Occult Siege” a Priority Assignment DLC.  As with the others of its kind it includes a few random missions themed around a story that have different paths.  But, is something like this worth the $3?\n\nDrive me Closer:  Like the others there really isn’t much here to talk about, the story is another of the choose-your-own-adventure style and I do look forward to trying different paths in the future but the missions themselves are nothing to mention as you’ve seen them over and over.  The reward is a Tarot card, one that increases your Glory which is great for the weekly glory grind, which alone is really worth the cost of the DLC.\n\nJust like the prevous ones this is all based around the reward and maybe a bit on story.  With that said I’d highly recommend you grab it for the tarot card alone.  Enjoy!\n","timestamp_created":1590859820,"timestamp_updated":1590859820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510676145553588867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvs2os/ICccWeiwI="}
