It is WAY too dark and I can't see or find anything besides two doors that say they need keys. This game NEEDS a brightness slider. I wandered around blindly in the dark clicking on everything trying to find a key. No luck. Are there even any keys to begin with? I have no idea what this game wants from me to continue. I can't see and there is no way to open the doors. Into the refund pile you go! I'm outtie 5000.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis is really messy. I give some leeway given that it is a single Dev, but this game REALLY should have been beta tested before release because it is nearly unplayable.\n\nI purchased this for $5 on sale and I'm shocked by the pile of unfinished mess I've gotten. I don't normally refund because I believe in letting the money go to future development, but I am seriously considering it this time. \n\nFirst, the game had a really hard time actually starting. I clicked play and my computer sat there for a solid twenty seconds before anything even happened. When 99% of my games start instantly, this was troubling. Then it attempted to start the game in VR mode, which stopped responding and crashed. Probably because this is not the machine that I have set up for VR so there was NO headset to detect. And further, this game isn't even VR!! Wth??\n\nThe game tried to access a nonexistent VR headset a second time and I was able to close the window that popped up. Jesus. For a game that is not VR, it seemed to really want to be played that way. \n\nI finally get to the menu and it's pretty straightforward, but no graphics options. Ok... I've played other games like that and they weren't bad. I kept going. \n\nYou start the game and it takes you to a briefly written plot synopsis. Woman disappears, sends a letter asking for help, and here you are. Got it. You have to hit 'backspace' to make the story go away. Then once you find your footing, your eyes are assaulted by giant white letters telling you that there IS in fact a graphics menu! Errrr, ok! I hit the designated letter 'G' to get there. \n\nIt said that everything was set to low quality so I bumped them all up to medium to see what a higher setting looked like. I hit 'C' to close and feel annoyed that the Esc key isn't universally used to shut all menus as it would be in a standard game. Annoyed and frustrated. Not a great start. I just wanted to play the game at this point.\n\nI back out of the graphics menu and everything looks like doodoo. What the hell happened? I hit 'G' again. The graphics once again say they are all set to low. What? I just changed these! What is going on? \n\nI tried to keep playing, but then the game sound screeched and stuttered like when the starter on your car engine goes out. Reeeeeeeeeeeee-tickey-tickey-tickey-tickey-BOOM!! And crashed to the desktop. Whoa. \n\nAll of that being said, I'm really stubborn and do my best to try and get through the game anyway. But as it is, this is an unplayable mess that is priced at nearly $10 retail. Nope. Nope!
