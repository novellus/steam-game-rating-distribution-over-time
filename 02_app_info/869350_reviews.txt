I wanted to pace it but nope ended up playing in one go but definitely don't regret that. I like the story setting to this game. I can see how much the creator is invested in this game. All the characters were pretty nice and solid and the twist at the end....hahaha some shockers. Downside is how short act 1 was and because of that certain characters didn't seem fully developed. But it's definitely worth it. I hope more people play this game!","timestamp_created":1610075040,"timestamp_updated":1610075040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkO387/YCeL+4wQI="}
