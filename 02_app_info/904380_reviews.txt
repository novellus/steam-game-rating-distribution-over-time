And to be fair, a game that 'borrows' so much of the trappings of DD should really have 'borrowed' the combat mechanics and depth of progression too, seriously.  So if that's what you are looking for, go look at Iratus or something that won't savagely leave you hanging.\n\nNow, with this out of the way, Vambrace is a ok game.  Severly overpriced at $30, but I got it at $10 and I don't regret it.  The combat is overly simple and procedural, and is mostly there to pace the story.  The crafting is also super simple, and the rpg/progression is nearly non-existent (companions don't level and each have ONE single item slot, items have, at best 3 tiers of quality). The main character skills up a few times during the story, but that's barebone to the point of triviality.\n\nSo why am I even giving this the thumbs up then?  Well, the universe, world and story work well and is somewhat original (although you do wonder why they lifted their races straight from D&D's Forgotten Realms, more 'borrowing'...)  The ambience is very nice, their art direction is on point (although, it's pretty much DD with a blue/cold tint) and I got immersed. The gentle grind of running expeditions and the brief exploration of the classes and items was pleasant (if extremely shallow).  Overall, I had a nice time.  Mind you I would have been furious at full price, but at $10, there's enough there.\n\nSo caveat emptor.  Know what you are buying: a short VN (visual novel) like game with DD inspired visuals and a patina of DD mechanics that's only skin deep.  If you are ok with this, and get a price you feel is appropriate, there's a universe where this is a decent buy.","timestamp_created":1610055083,"timestamp_updated":1610055083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v9yw7/YCefGwwQI="}
