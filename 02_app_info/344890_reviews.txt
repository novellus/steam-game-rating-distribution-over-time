Please look up the developers and the game before even considering a purchase.\n\nI bought the game back in 2016 expecting it to be treated like other early access games; incomplete to start with but slow, eventual progress towards a polished game. The game concept is the only redeeming quality, but its worthless without an actual game to back it up.\n\nTrue to their name, the devs have engaged in nefarious practices such as false advertisement, including padding of the feature list. See the right side of the store page? Several of those features don't even have a purpose in a game like this, much less are actually useable - the game has no multiplayer whatsoever, yet is tagged for PvP and Co-Op. They've clearly labelled the game to get on as many lists as possible. They've also randomly increased the price of the game to more than AAA-levels ($75+) periodically.\n\nThe game has not received any update in the public branch in over 3 years, and their internal dev branch (at least the one on steam) hasn't received an update in over 4 years. Yet, they continue to add tags to the game, change the title of it, make edits to the store page - all in an effort to spur people into dropping money on something they think is being treated with any care at all.\n\nThey seem really good at setting up roadmaps and promises of future updates / features in various places and then immediately abandoning them. Read the early access text closely - they intended a full release in 2016, nearly 4 years ago now. Further, they set up a 'public trello' roadmap, which hasn't been touched since mid 2017. Now, they have opened up a Discord where they farm out work on the game to community members with 'shares in the company' as the carrot on the stick - and even then,  there is no visible contribution or progress beyond a few token submissions, with responses from the devs sometimes taking months.\n\nI only paid $6 for the game and I still feel ripped off. I'm a fan of early access, and I've had some poor experiences with it, and usually it is worth the risk to help a new developer. However, this game is by far the worst experience I've had with an early access title - at least the second and third worst admitted they were dead and went F2P (and open source) after 3 years of stagnation instead of trying to edge more money out of customers and never respond with even a single update to the game.\n\nIf they're out of funding, they should start a kickstarter or something.","timestamp_created":1606871046,"timestamp_updated":1606871046,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592628538608551025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw98q+kPYCcYHStgI="}
