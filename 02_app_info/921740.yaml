    review: "This is a pretty standard Hidden Object Game.  There are maybe 10 levels\
      \ if I'm recalling correctly.  Each level has 6 modes of play.  Once you've\
      \ played through each mode the next level is unlocked.  The first mode is always\
      \ a standard HO mode where it tells you what to find and you find it in the\
      \ image.  The second mode involves descriptions of the object the game asks\
      \ you to find.  The third mode requires you to find 25 of the same object (for\
      \ example you find 25 cups).  The fourth mode is to find the difference between\
      \ the two pictures.  The fifth mode is a jigsaw puzzle.  The sixth mode is to\
      \ find the two matching objects, like there are 8 keys and 2 are identical.\
      \  In order to move on, you need to gain both a star and a gem. \n\nPassing\
      \ each mode/level is sort of related to time but, essentially you want to make\
      \ sure all your clicks happen as close to each other as possible.  In the standard\
      \ modes, this just means finding everything as fast as you can (I believe you\
      \ need to be around 30 seconds to get the star and gem).  In the spot the different\
      \ mode though it doesn't matter how long you take as long as you find all of\
      \ the differences immediately.\n\nThe game's interface isn't great and parts\
      \ of the game seem to freeze or stall with no way to move forward.  Sometimes\
      \ you can bypass this by escaping back out to the main menu and playing again\
      \ but other times that doesn't work well.  There aren't very obvious methods\
      \ to navigate and that can be a little frustrating at first.  I think one of\
      \ my biggest pet peeves with this game is the lack of direction.  So for example,\
      \ it doesn't tell you how much time you need to complete something in to get\
      \ the gem or star.  It doesn't tell you how many differences you need to spot\
      \ (it's 5 by the way) and when it comes to descriptions some of them are terrible!\
      \  I literally had to waste a round every now and then just randomly clicking\
      \ objects in the image to figure out what it was describing.  Other times, the\
      \ description was obvious but, humorously wrong, like the \"Stoned Lion\" as\
      \ opposed to the \"Stone Lion\".  I had quite a fun time picturing what a lion\
      \ would look like when stoned.  I found I had to play the first and second mode\
      \ several times in order to figure out where everything it asks you to find\
      \ is and then be able to get quick enough to meet the speed requirement.  The\
      \ bonuses fade too quickly in my opinion and to be honest this made me frustrated\
      \ and I enjoyed the game less.  I think I prefer other HOG's that have a timer\
      \ per object as opposed to the whole level so if there's one item giving you\
      \ trouble you don't lose the bonus/speed benefits of having found previous items.\
      \  I also don't care for their hint system.  It doesn't work on a timer system\
      \ and refill slowly on its own.  Instead, you are given a set number of hints\
      \ to start and then can purchase additional ones with in-game gems.\n\nThere\
      \ are also coins awarded which you can use to buy some upgrades to your home\
      \ but, I don't understand the point as it doesn't really tie into the story.\
      \  Of course, I guess that fits in here since the whole thing has a really tenuous\
      \ tie-in with the story.  The trailer for the game looks pretty interesting\
      \ and intriguing but, you don't actually see any of that in the game at all.\
      \  They use Shahrzad and the Arabian Nights theme but, they are telling a completely\
      \ unrelated story of their own.  Shahrzad doesn't tell the king stories to calm\
      \ him down over his daughter wanting to marry someone she tells him stories\
      \ to psychologically manipulate him into self-healing and trusting women again\
      \ after being cheated on by his wife.  It's actually a masterpiece exemplifying\
      \ the intelligence and cunning of the Arab and Persian woman.  This game instead\
      \ tells a bastardization of the story but fails to give any real meaningful\
      \ elements to make it it's own or engage you.  It's a basic plot only there\
      \ to serve as a means of moving you to the next scene and tells very little\
      \ actual story and doesn't really link well to its trailer or anything.  I still\
      \ don't know what my role as the player is in this game.  I seem to have been\
      \ sucked into the story but for what purpose?  To find some stuff for people?\
      \  Don't I care about getting home?  Why do I have a house here in this storybook\
      \ fiction?  Why would I waste time upgrading it?  What's up with the end scene?\
      \  Is there supposed to be a sequel?  Something seems like it didn't quite get\
      \ told to bring you from level ten to the end scene.  It just didn't make much\
      \ sense.\n\nThe graphics are really nice looking, very evocative of Middle Eastern\
      \ and Persian elements.  There is some occasional Middle Eastern and Persian\
      \ -esque music but much of the background music isn't very authentic to Persian,\
      \ Arabic, or Turkish music so feels out of place to me in this setting.\n\n\
      I'll also note that I initially had problems getting this game to play at all.\
      \  I had to completely turn off every aspect of my antivirus/antimalware/antispyware\
      \ software in order to get it to run.  I know that some games have problems\
      \ in this same way but I had to do more than just pause my software to get it\
      \ to run and that's a little worrisome and odd to me.\n\nI've decided to give\
      \ it a recommendation but, it only just barely passes because I still enjoyed\
      \ it when it was working well.  If I were giving this stars, I'd probably rate\
      \ it a 3.  I only recommend this if you love HOGs and if you can get this on\
      \ sale.  I don't believe it's worth the full price at about $10.  I played for\
      \ nearly 6 hours (some of that was actually it sitting there frozen or stalled)\
      \ which at full price makes this game about $1.70/hr of gameplay which I think\
      \ is too much."
