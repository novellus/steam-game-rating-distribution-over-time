I'm not sure if light should work like they do, but aside from this, it's a lovely little shunter.\nI think it instantly became my favourite british diesel shunter in this game, the wagons are also nicely made and with really neat weathering and graffiti. I love this loco's slightly sloped sides, narrow cab and tiny 0-6-0 wheels, it just feels very nice to look at to me. The sounds are very nice, there is no annoying idling, everything is seamlessly mixed. The horn is not separated into two different buttons for each tone but it sounds good enough for me to be okay with it.\nAlso I've been very pleasantly surprised to see it show up as quickdrive AI on the West Highland Line Extension route. I ran the blue version on it just because I thought it would fit there and oh! just saw that the people making preloads felt the same as another 07 began to roll next to me! It really fits in there and adds something completely different to its much bigger comrade class 37. For that reason, it's also worth getting the blue reskin because it fits the late BR oriented traffic better.","timestamp_created":1593988007,"timestamp_updated":1593988007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xdjFkPMCecaQkwI="}
