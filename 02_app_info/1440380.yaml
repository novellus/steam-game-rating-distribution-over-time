    review: 'Something about this concept appealed to me, and I took a gamble despite
      not really liking PvP games.

      This is launch day, and there''s a lack of immediate players. I feel like Burn
      the Witch has been priced out of impulse buy range, and especially out of "buy
      a copy for a friend" range which would have benefited it hugely.

      After a while I found a lobby with two other players, and it was a fun ten minute
      diversion. I''m not sure if the sense of paranoia causes people to just attack
      on sight, or if they just didn''t understand the objective. The game doesn''t
      seem to work well with small groups, since killing at random is a 50/50 chance
      of a win anyway.

      (I''m also not sure the game is working as intended. One game where I was the
      witch, I was stalking around and then heard one person killing another - presumably
      a peasant killing another peasant. The game ended with "Peasants Win" on screen.)

      This could be a fun little game, but it really needs to find a playerbase first,
      and I feel like that''s not happening at the current price point (14.99 USD).'
