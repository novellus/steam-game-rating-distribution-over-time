    review: "[b]As someone who has dumped probably 100 hours into [i]Plants vs. Zombies[/i],\
      \ naturally I'm drawn to [i]Hipster Attack[/i].[/b] [i]Hipster Attack[/i] has\
      \ some really high points, and some low points. To emulate the legendary [i]Plants\
      \ vs. Zombies[/i], it's all about balance, which is where this title stutters\
      \ a bit. \n\n[b]The high point with [i]Hipster Attack[/i] is in the humor, artwork,\
      \ and animation.[/b] And that stuff is seriously great. The low point is with\
      \ some of the mechanics. Most of the mechanics are a straight rip from inspiration,\
      \ but the new ones are not great. There is flying tofu that you have to click\
      \ to kill and it makes the whole thing overly twitchy and spammy. Another thing\
      \ is that the battlefield gets really chaotic and it's easy to lose your cursor\
      \ and even clickables. I think it's just the nature of the artwork. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\
      +Fantastic artwork and animation\n+The humor is great\n+Most of what is here\
      \ is fun\n+Price point is great\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-[strike]No Vsync so the gaming\
      \ rig screams[/strike] Fixed!\n-[strike]Needs options for larger cursor[/strike]\
      \ Fixed!\n-New mechanics aren't great\n\n[b]Yeah, I mean it's worth three bucks.[/b]\
      \ Sure. It isn't perfect, but it scratches that itch."
