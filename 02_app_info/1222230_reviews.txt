I think I finished the campaign in about 2 hours.\nHave nothing much to say about the single player, maybe if you're a flight sim fan you will dig it. it was not really my cup of tea.\n\nThe true source of happiness in this game is reveled when you go online to the multiplayer mode.\nYou actually have to gain true experience as a pilot to be able to dogfight anyone else on multiplayer and I friking love it.\nI found myself spending hours in the game trying to find new maneuvers  to surprise my opponent from the back, or from the front in a head on encounter.\nThere are a lot of variables to take into account while chasing someone in a dogfight or running away from them in one (warping, speed, distance, engine trail, gravity of other ships etc...) so, there is always some way for you to either kill the other guy or out maneuver him when he is chasing you.\nIt's like every time you kill or get killed, you learn a new skill or a new way of action that you could not think of before.\n\nThis true gain in experience you get from each dogfight is worth the entire game for me.","timestamp_created":1582761250,"timestamp_updated":1582761250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576580226421356201","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzYH7wfACddjk9AE="}
