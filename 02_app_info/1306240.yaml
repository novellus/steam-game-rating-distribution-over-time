    about_the_game: '<i>Freelance Trucker: Insurance Fraud Edition</i> puts the player
      behind the wheel of a commercial semi-truck, and in control of the finances
      of the trucker himself.  Navigate dangerous roads in unique delivery jobs, with
      a variety of cargo types depending on the job.  Safe and timely deliveries will
      earn you an honest paycheck, but these payouts yield diminishing returns, and
      the more lucrative gigs require more expensive insurance classes.   If your
      delivery ends in catastrophe, you''re entitled to an insurance claim, presuming
      you''re insured.  Players can use insurance payouts to unlock increasingly dangerous
      delivery jobs, higher salaries, and superior insurance plans.<br><br>This game
      was developed in Unity 3D by Blue Banana Productions.  This is a vehicle crash
      simulator that will test your driving skills.  It also includes a &quot;money
      management&quot; system where players can monitor damages, buy insurance, and
      use insurance to transfer damages into cash.  Players must carefully decide
      when and how to &quot;commit insurance fraud&quot; by sabotaging deliveries;
      it is necessary for career advancement, but too much destruction early on is
      not sustainable.   Players are given 5 save slots for parallel trucking careers,
      all of which can be overwritten if players wish to start new careers in previously
      used slots.  <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1306240/extras/transformerSite.gif?t=1605822791"
      /><br><br>Vehicle physics are based on the Eddy''s Vehicle Physics Unity 3D
      asset package, but modified so that players can perform aerial stunts, &quot;hydraulic
      hops,&quot; on-demand vehicle destruction, trailer detachment, and a &quot;lock
      up&quot; move similar to drifting.  Environments are semi-destructible, and
      most unique assets were created with Blender.  Texture and art assets were creating
      in the Paint Dot Net program, and audio assets with Audacity.  Inputs are managed
      by InControl, and support PS4 and Xbox One controllers, as well as keyboard
      &amp; mouse.  Next generation (PS5 and XBox Series X) controller support is
      still being determined, as these systems were only recently released.  Using
      a controller is recommended, as the button mapping is more intuitive, and driving
      may be easier, but a controller is not required.  <i>Freelance Trucker: Insurance
      Fraud Edition</i> features an original soundtrack by the Strange New Sounds
      studio.'

    review: Neat little game to waste some time, I enjoyed causing some mayhem and
      trying to survive until the goal (it's not always that easy). Far from perfect
      but enjoyable for sure for an indie title. Good job!
