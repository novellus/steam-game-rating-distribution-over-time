    review: "A great challenge platformer.\n* The controls feel somewhat too heavy,\
      \ but you get used to it. \n* The game flow (try-die-repeat) is perfect, there\
      \ is no downtime or annoying loading screens, everything is very snappy.\n*\
      \ Instant leaderboards, so you can instantly see after each attempt how good\
      \ it was and how much further you can push your time (if the intrinsic motivation\
      \ isn't enough).\n* Gameplay variety: each level can be played in a few categories\
      \ that often provide quite different experiences.\n* The music comes from staples\
      \ of the genre, so no complaints there. \n* The visual style is great. It may\
      \ look too bright and overloaded in screenshots, but it is much better in dynamics.\n\
      * The story is an unexpected bonus -- it is small and non-invasive, but it is\
      \ there and it is cute, presented via comics between episodes.\n\nOverall, I\
      \ like this game a lot, it hits all those singleplayer-Trackmania vibes for\
      \ me (\"run the track until you are happy with the time, then move on to the\
      \ next one\") without being the bloated monster that Trackmania has become.\
      \ \n\nThe devs here have done an amazing job with what little budget they had.\
      \ You can definitely see some rough edges (some menus look clunky, character\
      \ models are very low-detail, time bonuses are not explained anywhere etc),\
      \ but this game has it where it matters, and it's a real shame to see it lost\
      \ in the depths of steam with not even enough reviews to get a rating.\n\nP.S.\
      \ The game runs flawlessly on Linux with proton"
