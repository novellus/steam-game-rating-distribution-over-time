The control are extremely simple: Space to jump and double jump, mouse to aim and fire. That's it.\nThis isn't a perfect game mind you. There's some bug here and there, the gameplay is extremely simplistic and the game take less than 40 minutes to complete. It is however a game that cost less than 2$ with multiple difficulty mode. And between each zone, there,s a bit of the story that's told through little illustration with no word and you are able to understand what is going on. The music is also really great.\nFor the first ever game made by that developer, it's a good game IMO\n","timestamp_created":1605852480,"timestamp_updated":1605852480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoIiR8vUCfIq2rwI="}
