I've never worked so fast to leave a bad review. Half the time, you can't even select your characters to use their skills. I've had multiple \"game over\" screens indicating a lost battle, but will still have a couple remaining party members. Other strange glitches coming in and out of scenes. The writing sucks, you're thrown in to a random world with really no backdrop of what's going on. Basically, some developers had an idea for combat and hastily scrawled a story around it. Don't let a somewhat pretty looking game fool you...this isn't Blackguards, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, or any other reasonably competent turn based game. This has been sitting in my library for years, and now I know why I've put off playing it so long. \n\nIrredeemable TRASH.","timestamp_created":1610081210,"timestamp_updated":1610081210,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6bGU8PYCfbm6wQI="}
