    review: "I must admit that Emma: Lost in Memories is a hard game for me to review.\
      \ On one hand, it's has a really novel idea that I love. On the other hand,\
      \ it's main flaw is pretty glaring, and if it's price wasn't so low or if steam\
      \ had a \"Neutral\" rating, I probably wouldn't be recommending it.\n\n[b]\u2022\
      \ Minor Pros[/b]\n- While some of the reviews here say that the game is too\
      \ short (and for the average game, it indeed is), I feel it lasts exactly long\
      \ enough that all it's concepts are well explored, but short enough that it\
      \ doesn't become boring or drawn out.\n\n[b]\u2022 Pros:[/b]\n- The hook of\
      \ the game is amazing. It's innovative in concept and well executed. It ties\
      \ in with the story too, which is nice.\n- The overall mechanics are simple,\
      \ yet fully explored. Despite having only three buttons (or less, in the later\
      \ stages), the levels never got repetitive.\n- The Feather Collectibles offer\
      \ some replayability and, in most levels, create a whole new challenge instead\
      \ of only making the original challenge slightly harder.\n\n[b]\u2022 Minor\
      \ Cons:[/b]\n- The difficulty curve is not the best. It wasn't uncommon for\
      \ me to struggle with a level, only for the following two or three to be a breeze.\n\
      - Yes, most of the times you make a mistake you die and restart pretty quickly.\
      \ Still, it was not uncommon for me to realize I had messed something up and\
      \ then spend a couple of seconds looking for a wall of spikes or pit to throw\
      \ myself into, which doesn't feel good. It's very nitpicky and less relevant\
      \ later on, where 3/4 of the level kills you, but I don't think a instant reset\
      \ button would hurt.\n\n[b]\u2022 Con[/b]\n- The only big problem I have with\
      \ this game is that it's focus as a puzzle platformer fades over time, and it\
      \ starts becoming a relentlesly difficult precision platformer. This becomes\
      \ pretty clear at the halfway point and forward, where in many levels you quickly\
      \ figure out how to reach the finish line, but actually getting there can be\
      \ pain. It harshly diminishes the initial satisfaction of solving the puzzle,\
      \ and devolves into a endurance test of trying to succeed in two or more almost\
      \ pixel-perfect actions in a row. Since sometimes the solution involves this\
      \ kind of platforming, it can also be hard to distinguish jumps you are supposed\
      \ to make to solve the level and jumps you can't make at all.\n\n(Sorry for\
      \ any grammar mistakes. English is not my native language, but I feel like this\
      \ sort of feedback is important for the developers, specially since I liked\
      \ the concept of the game so much.)"
