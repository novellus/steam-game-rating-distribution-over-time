    review: "Caveat: I only put 2 hours in to this game in two different sessions.\
      \ I gave it two tries and then I was finished with it. Here is why: \n\nWhen\
      \ the game begins you start with a pistol, and a wave of aliens insects attack\
      \ you from the front. You are stationary. There is limited movement but you\
      \ are essentially a turret. It took me a few tries to get past the first wave.\
      \ With the pistol these insect aliens take many shots. They move slowly but\
      \ because they take so many hits to kill every shot counts, so you need to score\
      \ dozens of hits and hope to kill them before they reach you. It is all very\
      \ monotonous and boring. \n\nOnce they reach you they stand around the crate\
      \ thing that represents your body, and your life starts slowly draining. You\
      \ will eventually die from this obviously. After figuring this out getting to\
      \ wave 2 wasn't difficult, just boring. I could not find many options as far\
      \ as switching weapons or finding power ups. Just the one weak pistol. If someone\
      \ explains how to choose different weapons a la Space Pirate Simulator I will\
      \ revisit the game, but this is effectively space pilot simulator minus the\
      \ ability to move and dodge, ability to choose multiple weapons and shields,\
      \ enemies that are a challenge to hit, ranged attacks, and cool backgrounjd\
      \ atmosphere.\n\nThe best I can say about this game is that the graphics are\
      \ pretty good, although the levels I played were cramped and bland. I always\
      \ feel bad giving a game a negative review, and always trie to find something\
      \ good to say about a game because I buy games based on positive reviews and\
      \ I understand that games that don't appeal to me aren't necessarily bad, but\
      \ this game has no saving graces."
