      \ Golden Grain many times. Growing up he dreamed of finding the treasure, however,\
      \ he didn\u2019t have enough strength and determination. Now, when he is grown\
      \ up, he decided to fulfill his childhood dream and find this artifact.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nJoin our hero, to experience a wonderfull adventure in various and\
      \ colorful locations. Starting in a modest forest, throughout rich castles,\
      \ down to the secrets of the deep sea. Help Birdie defeat the threats he might\
      \ encounter, and with help of other travelers lead him to the Golden Grain.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIn &quot;Go! Birdie&quot;, you have to collect all fruits\
      \ present in grid-based, maze-like levels. Other animals will try to stop you,\

      \ bonus levels, where time is your only enemy. You can either maximize your\
      \ score by beating whole game at once, or play it cool from chapter to chapter."
