After you complete 3-4 which is the final level, you unlock a stage select from the menu screen. Nate's head sprite even changes if you can finish the game. Corruption Mode is a fun bonus mode.\n\nI must admit that I got stuck in level 2-4. The best controller I recommend is the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. I was able to finish the last level with a Switch Pro on Steam. I had more trouble playing this game using a Playstation 4 controller.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend buying this game on Steam. The price is affordable and the bonus modes add extra value. I admire the retro game design, because I am currently creating my first Gamemaker game. I would easily purchase a sequel in the future from Kupoapo Games.\n","timestamp_created":1609882092,"timestamp_updated":1609882092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnuic6vYCeMXpwAI="}
