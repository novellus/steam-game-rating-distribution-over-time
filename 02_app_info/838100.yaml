    review: "Point is a nice, short puzzle game if you feel bored. If you rarely play\
      \ puzzle games this is a nice distraction when waiting for a short amount of\
      \ time since the levels are compact and generaly do not take more than 5 minutes,\
      \ similar to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/266010/LYNE/]Lyne[/url]\
      \  or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/Hexcells/]Hexcells[/url].\
      \ If you are a hardcore-puzzler you will probably go through this in one short\
      \ sitting. However for 80 cents it is well worthwile in my opinion.\n\nYour\
      \ goal is traversing through a network of nodes and edges to the goal whilst\
      \ reaching the exact point count shown on the goal node. You gain points by\
      \ traversing through nodes which add 5 points or double your points, there are\
      \ also nodes which subtract 5 points, teleport you or reset the map. There are\
      \ a total of 50 levels.\n\nThe 80's asthetics are a nice touch, though I would\
      \ have liked the design of the different nodes to be more distinctive. Everything\
      \ that changes is the number of corners around a given node, and the game doesnt\
      \ communicate what node does what, you have to find out by trial and error.\
      \ This was a bit frustrating because some nodes do nothing but look different\
      \ than the starting node which does nothing, yet also do nothing leaving me\
      \ at first confused if I oversaw something. Also the teleport-nodes all look\
      \ the same, so if you have multiple teleports you have to find out by trial\
      \ and error where they go and memorize them. A bit of colourcoding really would\
      \ have helped here.\n\nIn almost all levels the goal node corresponds to the\
      \ maximum points you can reach, although in one level I managed to score 5 points\
      \ more than the goal. Sadly that makes the game a little to predictive, since\
      \ you for example always want to collect 5 points as soon as possible if they\
      \ are in reach. It would be nice if some levels would require to lose some points\
      \ on purpose to reach the goal, requiering more strategy.\n\nThough not as bad\
      \ as in most puzzle games I played, this gmae suffers from introducing new concepts\
      \ to early while not fully exploiting the allready existing mechanics to its\
      \ fullest, in order to create an artificial sense of difficulty. A puzzle game\
      \ which handles this nearly perfectly to my opinion is \n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/353540/Stephens_Sausage_Roll/]\
      \ Stephen's Sausage Roll [/url], where the complexity grows exponentially with\
      \ every new tool at your disposal, which rarerly happens in this game.\n\nAll\
      \ in all I think this type of puzzle-game has a lot of potential and could be\
      \ expanded upon by different number-modifiers, directed edges (Eulerian Path),\
      \ and many well known concepts of graph theory."
