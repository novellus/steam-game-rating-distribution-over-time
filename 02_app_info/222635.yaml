    about_the_game: "One of the classic early diesel era locomotives, the Class 52,\
      \ comes to Train Simulator as seen on mainline rail tours across the UK.<br><br>Built\
      \ by British Rail for the Western Region between 1961 and 1964, the Type 4 locomotive\
      \ followed the Western Region\u2019s preference for diesel-hydraulic models,\
      \ compared to the more usual diesel-electric locomotives seen elsewhere on the\
      \ network and a need for a high-powered locomotive to head top-link services.\
      \ In total, 74 models were built at BR\u2019s Swindon Works and Crewe Works,\
      \ and the twin Maybach engines delivered a top speed of 90mph (140 km/h). <br><br>Whilst\
      \ the design of the Class was largely successful, its working life was relatively\
      \ short, with retirement beginning in the early 1970s and the Class being fully\
      \ withdrawn by 1977 and scrapped shortly after. They were also never renumbered\
      \ under TOPS, becoming the last class of locomotive on the BR network not to\
      \ carry a TOPS number.<br>However, their popularity has seen some locomotives\
