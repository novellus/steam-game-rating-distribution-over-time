      \ tanks like the Crusader Mk.I. As a result of the modernisation, the armour\
      \ on the tank was strengthened, but the basic design remained unchanged. The\
      \ engine installed allows the tank to reach a maximum speed of 42 km/h. The\
      \ armament on the tank is represented by a 40mm Ordnance QF 2 pounder cannon\
      \ with 110 rounds of ammunition, as well as two 7.92 mm BESA machine guns. This\

      \ the service ceiling of the fighter by almost a kilometer and improve the climb\
      \ rate. The aircraft was immediately put into mass production, and went on to\
      \ participate in the final phases of the Battle of Britain. The 1175 hp engine\
      \ allows this fighter to reach a top speed of over 560 km/h. This premium fighter\
