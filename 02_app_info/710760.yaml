    reviews: "\u201CHigh Noon VR is WAY more fun than any $9.99 stationary shooter\

    review: "\n[h3][b]An uninspired wave shooter marred by horrible voice acting and\
      \ a ridiculous grind.[/b][/h3]\n\n[b]High Noon VR shows glimmers of good work,\
      \ then throws it in the trash.[/b]\nThe environments are passable (if a little\
      \ repetitive), the guns are well modelled, and the shooting gameplay is simple\
      \ and effective. There's a foundation of a halfway-decent game here, if it had\
      \ more content to it. Instead, High Noon employs cheap tricks to stretch out\
      \ its content far past its welcome, and these make its other flaws even more\
      \ unbearable. \n\n[b]\u0CA0_\u0CA0 Progression is a grind.[/b]\nEvery enemy\
      \ in this game has a health bar that your weapons deplete. Even headshots aren't\
      \ enough to kill enemies if your weapon isn't a high enough level. You're forced\
      \ to accumulate cash for upgrades, but this progression takes far too long and\
      \ requires repeating levels - especially if you don't specialize in one choice\
      \ of weapon or another.\n\nIf the game didn't have this grind, you'd blow through\
      \ its levels in 45 minutes and then immediately request a steam refund of your\
      \ $10. Obviously, we can't have that.\n\n[b]\u0CA0_\u0CA0 There's no mechanics\
      \ for cover, dodging, or other damage mitigation beyond shooting.[/b]\nFights\
      \ in this game are effectively a DPS (Damage per Second) race - you need to\
      \ blow away enemies' health bars before they take yours out. There's no way\
      \ of mitigating damage aside from shooting threats - no use of cover or moving\
      \ your body, which is a terrible waste of roomscale VR's potential.\n\n[b]\u0CA0\
      _\u0CA0 Enemy design is dull and their voice acting is uninspired.[/b]\nOnly\
      \ a half-dozen different character models in the game exist, with a boring palette\
      \ swap of their clothing colors. After you fight a boss in one stage, they become\
      \ mooks in the next one for you to stomp on. You'll occasionally hear a \"Hey,\
      \ you!\" from the 'sexy' female enemies. What fun.\n\n[b]\u0CA0_\u0CA0 The narrator\
      \ sounds like a sexist basement dweller.[/b]\nBetween badly reading western\
      \ romance novel text in the shopping stage, to calling the women 'skanks', the\
      \ narration of this game is unredeemable trash. The developer's response was\
      \ to add a mute button for him and call it fixed, when honestly, these narration\
      \ files should have just been deleted outright.\n\n[b]Bottom-line, this game\
      \ isn't worth buying, even at sale rates.[/b]\nIf you're looking for a simple,\
      \ Western-themed wave shooter, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/685690/GunsnStories_Bulletproof_VR/]Guns'n'Stories[/url]\
      \ easily beats out this game for the same price point on every single aspect.\
      \ There's no ridiculous grind, higher quality enemies, and a far less obnoxious\
      \ narrator. Plus, it features a demo.\n\n[quote]\n[b]For more reviews like this\
      \ one, follow the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38513044/]\u0CA0\
