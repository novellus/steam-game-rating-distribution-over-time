I want to mention that I have not watched the other anime. Nor have I went through the VN yet. ( Despite having both.. Backlog on both and I admit I do not watch anime or go through vns in any particular order. I just go through the stuff when when the mood strikes me. This does make me want to go through the VN soon tho.. )\n\nNow to my view on the anime.\n\nI am just going to say that.. I really liked this anime. It is a bit dark in some aspects so thats going to be a bit of a warrning there. ( I mean like.. Really dark. ) A decent amount of the story can be predicted if you pay attention to what is going on but there was one thing I admit it was.. Umm.. Yea. I did not expect something to happen. Now I did think something was due to something happening but not in the way it did. ( Yea I know I am being cryptic here but I am trying my best to not do any spoilers. )\n\nAt this point all I can really say is. I really enjoyed the anime but it has some messed up scenes in it. Due to that I can not recommend it to everyone. This anime wont be for everyone. Especially those who can not handle gore or traumatic events in anime format. Also if you have a fear of hospitals this might just increase that a bit. ( Thankfully I do not but I am going in for a major surgery in a few days as of this review.. One that is supposed to take several hours and was told I will be in the hospital for at least 1-2 weeks if not more. Not the most I have spent in a hospital but still sucks XD )\n\nNow here is the portion of my review to tell you about Steam's video player. It needs work like I stated in other reviews I have done so far. So please keep that in mind. The video portion is also provided by Crunchyroll and I will be honest when I say.. I do not know for sure if this is censored or not. Odds are it is in some way or another.","timestamp_created":1498485199,"timestamp_updated":1498489388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483125478029251099","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvq+78twCcaKXfQ=="}
