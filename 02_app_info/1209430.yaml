    about_the_game: "Dungeon Cards is an exciting mix of puzzle, card game, and a\
      \ classical roguelike. Each movement of your card creates a unique and challenging\
      \ situation, a mini-puzzle which requires strategic thinking to solve.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nIn this card roguelike, you move your character card about a field\
      \ of nine cards. You have to clash your card with neighboring cards to move\
      \ it. Monster cards and trap cards will decrease your card's health, healing\
      \ cards will... well, heal you, cards with gold will increase your game score\
      \ and there are also many other cards with unique abilities and behaviors.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is built with a classical roguelike formula: it is\
      \ a turn-based dungeon crawler in a fantasy setting with selectable characters,\
      \ procedurally generated dungeons, pixel art graphics, and the permadeath.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose one of the ten heroes, descend into the magical dungeon\
      \ and slay hordes of monsters in quest of epic loot!"
