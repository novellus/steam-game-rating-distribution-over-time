Buyer beware. Other than that, it's a simplistic wanna-be \"FTL\", but its not. It could be good for small children who just barely know how to read. In fact, it should come with an expected player age of 7 years old. This isn't insult or malice, I just think that the target audience should be an upfront aspect shown to the buyer.","timestamp_created":1575000525,"timestamp_updated":1575000525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490625947713851929","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jJnW2u4CfuSc3wE="}
