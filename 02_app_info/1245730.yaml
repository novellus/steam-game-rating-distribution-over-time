    review: This game is awesome!  I love the simple, yet entertaining graphics and
      the music is super catchy.  The sound effects of the cat noises crack me up!  Even
      the subtle, dry yet witty dialogue adds to the games charm.  It is evident that
      this game had lots of heart and soul put into it!  If you like cats (or even
      if you don't) do yourself a favor and buy this game.
