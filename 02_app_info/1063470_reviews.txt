I hate giving bad reviews but the UX design of this game is atrocious.  For example, they could have had you duck forward like they do in real life while going down the slope but instead the game has you wave your hands around in a way you're not even sure it wants you to, in a way completely unrelated to ski jumping at all.  And the tutorial makes no sense at all, makes the game basically unplayable.  Had I not got this on sale and left it sit there for a few months I'd have requested a refund.","timestamp_created":1605066699,"timestamp_updated":1605066789,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iPLb2vUCfOnWrQI="}
