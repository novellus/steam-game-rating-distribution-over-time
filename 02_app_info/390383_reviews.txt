I will say though that there are some alternate tunings here. Joke and the Thief is in drop D and the lead for Slow Ride is in like Open E or something. \nStill, the rhythm part of Slow Ride is in standard tuning, fun to play and includes the solo. I'm a big wolfmother fan so Joker and the Thief is awesome and Ziggy Stardust is cool too","timestamp_created":1509949202,"timestamp_updated":1509949202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Yv/x98CeqTEigE="}
