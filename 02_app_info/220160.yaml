    review: "PC port is utter trash. A lot of issues with their shitty connect software\
      \ that is mandatory to use. \nAnd the worst part: You CAN'T get the DLC. There\
      \ is no way for you to get it or play it on PC. The DLC for Evo was amazing\
      \ and added so much to all parts of the game.\nThis is still the best Trials\
      \ game of the series but only if you can get it on a 360."
