    about_the_game: "You run at high speed and attack enemies.<br />\r\nThe main point\
      \ is to enjoy feeling of speed and your own dexterity. For me, just running\
      \ forward is a pleasure itself.<br />\r\nMoreover there's a gameplay which requires\
      \ accuracy of your movements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am a big fan of the old 90s\
      \ games, and I tried to reproduce the graphic style of some games of that era.\
      \ In general, I tried to make levels in the spirit of the first Quake, and to\
      \ achieve the same feeling of a shotgun. Although this is not the main weapon\
      \ in my game.<br />\r\nIn summing up, you may enjoy the game if you like fast\
      \ running, feeling of speed and the action games in general.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n* A hard to master game with unusual gameplay.<br />\r\n* Fast-paced, it requires\
      \ good reflexes and dexterity.<br />\r\n* Short, it only takes an hour or two\
      \ to beat.<br />\r\n* Software-rendered retro style graphics from the '90s."
