The actions sound aren't invasive (in these type of game, there is also the risk about sounds very disturbing after a few of minutes, but the taken choice has been correct according to me, for except about the click button into main menu as I said.\n- Story: it' simple. It's a plot between one of the most important and tragics events of the world and a fantasy adventure (good the choice about an hero-machine and the link with a simple coffee machine, I like it, because these imaginative features can approach to the game also young gamers). Summarily, the game's story wants to present a mature game but correctly adapted to new generation of gamers (and more young. It's a way to hand down to a new generation the vintage look of the videogames, always current)\n-Gameplay: simple and intuitive (with keyboard and joystick). Anyhow, the tutorial is available for every doubt or difficulty. Be careful to the movement of the character. I think it's very fluid until you got used to it. But this fluidity is a positive feature in particular if you play to the \"extra\" game ( I don't want spoiler anything. You must try it, it's funny).\n","timestamp_created":1525610875,"timestamp_updated":1525610875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507586479187011719","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4h9HfmuMCdsbknwE="}
