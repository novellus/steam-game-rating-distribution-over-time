The \"painterly\" graphics are pleasing, and it is a very streamlined game. You choose one of two places to go, and find there either quest advancement, an item (weapon, armor, jewelry, treasure, potion), a shrine (that refills one of your stats), or an enemy. You can sort of create your own build through equipping the ten active, three passive, and three free skills that you'd like. You can also equip items that lend themselves to what you're trying to do. You can trade the treasures you find for weapons, armor, or potions.\n\nI chose to use a weapon that doubled my damage, but greatly increased the chances that my spells would fizzle (fail). I would then use Steady Advance (which cannot fail and makes your next skill succeed) to push through my Doom skill for 30 willpower damage. This simple strategy was quite effective, but there were still many enemies that bested me, including a tentacled monster that seemed to gain 15 or more in his willpower stat every single turn.\n\nAlthough I liked the \"bones\" of the experience, there are just too many issues here to recommend: \n[list]\n[*]If you fall in combat, you retreat. You can't switch your skills around and then re-engage with the enemy you were previously fighting. Once you retreat, you can only go to a different location. This represents a missed opportunity for the player to engage with the skills being offered.\n[*]Certain locations seem to \"gate\" areas, and I was often disoriented as to what river I'd crossed and where I needed to go to complete each quest. Certain locations seem to only be present in certain regions.\n[*]Figuring out how to view item stats during trades is un-intuitive. You have to click on a small button underneath each item to reveal it's stats, one by one.\n[*]It's unclear how to raise your armor proficiency. I obtained many pieces of armor that required armor proficiency of 1, 2, or 3 long before I obtained the skill. I finally obtained the skill by equipping a random piece of jewelry that gave me an armor proficiency point.\n[*]I acquired many seemingly random items, such as sulfur and an inactive potion, but these never came into play during any of the quests I did.\n[*] I often encountered a trader that was meant to help me consolidate my treasures (allowing me to trade multiple treasures for one of higher value), but I could never equal the value of even one of his treasures, even with all of mine combined.\n[/list]\nLastly, the game just began to slow down to a crawl after a while. I reached a witch that seemed to have a lot of tasks she wanted me to do, and I just felt like I ended up going everywhere but where she wanted me to go.\n\nThe frequency of my battle losses also increased, without me feeling that I was getting access to any better skills or equipment to improve the performance of my willpower-attacking build.\n\nImproving the game would involve covering armor proficiency in the tutorial, allowing the ability to retreat and re-engage in battle (perhaps if you had not been killed), giving the traders lower value trinkets, and perhaps providing some sort of \"overview\" map. The locations seem randomized, but perhaps players could be informed of what \"region\" they are currently in.","timestamp_created":1576527690,"timestamp_updated":1576544662,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54600822925567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn87YiO8CeO7k5AE="}
