    review: 'Yea, yea I actually would recommend this game.  It ended up being a lot
      better than I expected it to be from initial impressions.  It plays a lot like
      Castlevania, though you have a much smaller primary weapon - thus less opportunity
      for damage mitigation.  However, the game''s design takes this into account.  There''s
      opportunities to heal, usually appropriately placed.  The biggest hurdle is
      just figuring the game out.  The game, and manual if you track it down (it is
      not included in this release) both lie.  You can tackle the stages in any order,
      and beat the bosses in any order, but each sword has ONE boss that takes double
      damage from it.  Once you swap to another sword, you cannot go back.  So there''s
      a linear pattern you are supposed to play in, but if you are good you can do
      it however you like.


      A unique feature is the falcon.  In two player mode, the second player controls
      the falcon, letting them deal damage elsewhere on the screen while the main
      player progresses.  This helps find hidden items, and the bird is required to
      damage some enemies.  You do have partial control over the bird in single player,
      can set it to fly, and attack, but it''s much more capable in someone else''s
      hands.


      The game is challenging, but not overly so.  Once you get the hang of it, it
      can be completed fairly quickly.  I honestly do believe this is a bit of a hidden
      gem for the system.  And yes, it is emulated, so you could use the ROM with
      another emulator if you wished.  Worth a purchase, on sale at least.'
