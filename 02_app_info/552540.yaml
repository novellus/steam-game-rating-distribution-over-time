    review: "I wanted to like this game, I really really did. I waited for it to release\
      \ and bought almost immediately after it did. However it's just not what I expected.\
      \ \n\nLet me preface by saying that I have a soft spot for rpg maker games.\
      \ There was a point in my life where all I had was a hand-me-down PC, slow internet\
      \ access and barely enough cash to scrape by on. I played free rpg maker games\
      \ to unwind. I still pick one up now and then to enjoy. \n\nLet me start with\
      \ what I liked. The mapping and character art is great. This game looks really\
      \ polished. Sprawling maps to explore. I love nothing more than grabbing a pencil\
      \ and keeping track of maps and where I have yet to explore. This game has a\
      \ nifty map option that helps you see exits on each map. I really enjoyed that.\n\
      \nI do intend to persevere with Lotia and finish it but I put it down for the\
      \ following reasons:\n\n1. Random encounter battles with the same redundant\
      \ fight over and over again. I could tolerate this usually but exploring the\
      \ huge maze like maps and having a battle every five steps is just gluttony\
      \ for punishment. If I'm rolling my eyes at the start of each battle, here's\
      \ your sign.\n\n2. Lackadaisical character development. I have no feelings for\
      \ the characters whatsoever because I had no introduction to them. The game\
      \ began with a brief cut scene that tried to play out with urgency but failed.\
      \ I have little information about the characters in which to gauge their motivations\
      \ for being who they are and doing what they do. You simply handed a party of\
      \ the standard classes of rpg characters and expected to give hoot about their\
      \ job/plight and I just wasn't able to muster it BECAUSE.....\n\n3. You are\
      \ bombarded with books/tomes of try-hard science-fictiony lore that reads like\
      \ they plucked the worst writer from the syfy channel and tasked them with this\
      \ portion of the game. After reading about 15 of the long winded tomes I decided\
      \ I didn't give a **** about the dream world or it's history. I quit reading\
      \ them. They are BORING and convoluted nonsense. They try to weave a dreamworld\
      \ setting where everyone exists in an alternate reality....or wait....is everyone\
      \ asleep....no wait....that can't be it....it's just all jumbled up in my head\
      \ and I can't make sense of it because the premise sucks. It sucks. It's dumb.\
      \ I'm sorry.\n\n4. It's easy. I've played a shit ton of rpg's in the past 15\
      \ years. FFVII was my first. I recently beat FFXV. Chrono Trigger. The tales\
      \ series. The Lunar games. The Trails games....you get the point. There is no\
      \ challenge here. They try to hide the challenge behind beasts that stand for\
      \ emotions but it's just a facade for the basics.\n\n5. The world map is a list.\
      \ You select a location from the list. Usually the first point on the list is\
      \ where you are coming from (a town). Then there are a few random maps with\
      \ some loot and the last point is the general destination you are supposed to\
      \ be going to. You explore momentarily, nab a chest or two, exit the map and\
      \ select another point from the list. The more fun maps to explore are the target\
      \ destinations. It's a weird way to do an overworld map and it would be forgivable\
      \ if it weren't for problems 1-4.\n\nI don't know guys. I keep thinking about\
      \ all the free or super cheap rpg maker games I've played over the years that\
      \ stole my heart. Even if this one had been free, I don't think I would have\
      \ finished it. Since I paid for it and played too long for a refund I will try\
      \ to finish but I'm disappointed. Seasoned rpg fans beware."
