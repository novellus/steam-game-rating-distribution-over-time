    review: Out of the series to date, this is the best of the 4 so far. But it's
      still not worth the full price, and it will make less sense than usual if you
      didn't play the previous games. I might be a bit too harsh on this one, as it
      was less reliant on HOs and had more puzzling, and features like a map and lockable
      inventory bar, but given my lack of enjoyment of the rest of the series, I can't
      say I would recommend it. (And in case you were wondering, yes, I played them
      all to the end, but I was too late for the refund (yes, I tried), and I just
      personally couldn't justify not playing games I spent money on, so judge as
      you will. :-) )
