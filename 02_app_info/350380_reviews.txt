This is probably my favorite BOOK of all time.  The movie was ok but poor casting and pacing made it underwhelming.  The book is just a different animal - its a light hearted techno thriller vs the action movie Hollywood tried to produce.  And this \"experience\"  is nothing but a 10 minute advertisement / summary of the movie.  Basically its a handful of key moments of the story with 2D clips and 4 (give or take based on definition of game) interactive mini games in between.   \n\nThat being said, you feel mostly disappointed because of the potential this could have had.  The visuals clearly had some effort go into them and, for a few seconds (literally), in a few key spots it actually does enhance the overall book if you are a fan.  The opening walking to the door is neat, first mini game (sorting) is terrible but the room itself was well done, crane mini game was ok, driving was actually kind of fun, ship thing was ok and the space part was pretty fun.  All very restricted and all very, very short.  But the designing of the rooms / environments were good enough that i just wondered why bother when they really did nothing with it.\n\nI typically don't mind spending a few dollars even if its for a short experience but solely because i felt this was nothing more than an advertisement for the movie i am refunding since i already paid for the movie.  They could take out the cut scenes and add a Steam Home environment size camp with access to the different mini games (and even logs) and a few basic things to explore and then i would have kept it as a short \"The Martian Experience\".  But in its current form...","timestamp_created":1609110286,"timestamp_updated":1609110286,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw682c0/YCde/0vQI="}
