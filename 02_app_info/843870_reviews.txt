The logic is flawed in measuring your actions - preventing you from making legal plays because one of the multiple things you could do would result in an illegal play (for example, if there are three playable cards in the discard, you can't pick it up and play two, discard one - because it sees you *could play all three, and if you did, *then you'd have to discard the card in your hand but you aren't eligible to do that).  \n\nIt's adequate, in the absence of a better option, but I can't really \"recommend\" it.","timestamp_created":1604641545,"timestamp_updated":1604641545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4stuFzvUCf+rOrAI="}
