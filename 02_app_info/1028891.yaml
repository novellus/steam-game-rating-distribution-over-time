    review: "Greetings Everyone!  This will be a short review for the Cosmetic DLC\
      \ \u201CSeal of Inquisition Footprints\u201D which is well, exactly what it\
      \ sounds like.  You leave footprints that are shaped like glowing I\u2019s (the\
      \ symbol of the most holy Imperial Inquisition).\n\nHappy Feet:  I am torn with\
      \ this DLC as it is only $2 and I like to support developers, not to mention\
      \ there is never enough cosmetics in any game as you will be looking at the\
      \ same character (more or less) for possibly a hundred hours.  But, it is $2\
      \ for something purely cosmetic and provides very little to the game outside\
      \ of fun immersion (which might be enough as it is).  It would have been nice\
      \ if this included a mission to unlock it, something narrative maybe?  And a\
      \ minor buff would give a reason to choose between other cosmetics.\n\nAfter\
      \ thinking I\u2019ll say this, if you enjoy cosmetics then I\u2019d recommend\
      \ otherwise I\u2019d wait for a sale, they happen fairly often and grab it with\
      \ a bundle.  Enjoy!"
