However, I can't really recommend it very much: navigation awkward, videos extremely blurry, keep traveling through walls and need to restart. Concept sounded good, but the execution felt very lacking, and there was very little coherency. Gameplay was minimal and content extremely limited. Felt more like a partially completed demo version\n\nAll that being said, it's short enough to perhaps try for yourself, and just refund if it doesn't appeal to you as expected.","timestamp_created":1538877635,"timestamp_updated":1538877635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m6eQpuYCe7WdrAE="}
