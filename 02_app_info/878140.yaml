    review: "[b] Witch of the Woods [/b] is a resource management game where you are\
      \ trying to balance the ecosystem of the forest, while also battling the spreading\
      \ corruption. Sounds like a great concept to me. You cast spells that change\
      \ the population of different animals which influences the food chain, if one\
      \ of the animals die you loose the game. There is just one little problem. I\
      \ beat the game in 10 minutes and I was not even trying to do so. You should\
      \ have seen the stare on my face. I am not trying to be a jerk here, but if\
      \ your resource management game can be completed in 10 minutes by someone who\
      \ never played the game - the decision making aspect of your game has failed.\n\
      \nThe game has 3 different modes such as story, standard and endless. Unfortunately,\
      \ all of those modes kind of amount to the same thing because there is nothing\
      \ to look forward to, not even miserable achievement for surviving. Maybe if\
      \ they had a couple different maps with different seasons, that would be good.\
      \ Perhaps new maps could add more animals. But as it stands Witch of the Woods\
      \ has absolutely nothing to accomplish beyond the 5 - 20 minutes that it takes\
      \ to beat it. I am not angry because I wasted money, I am angry because the\
      \ developers wasted a good concept. Can we get an actual reason to keep playing\
      \ the game? \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ nice aesthetic\n+ promising concept\n\n\
      [h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- completed in 10 minutes...\n- nothing to work toward\n\
      - the decision making, should probably be more complex?\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts:\
      \ 4/10 [/b]\n\nHey the concept is great and the gameplay has potential. At the\
      \ very least we should get some achievements to grind the endless mode for a\
      \ few hours. Ideally though, I would like to see 3 more maps for each season\
      \ with a few new animals, then it might be a decent game. Like you got to give\
      \ the player something to work toward, your decision making game needs to give\
      \ some resistance. I beat it in 10 minutes, there is nothing to do here. Yea\
      \ it looked pretty, not much of a decision making game though.\n\n[code]If the\
      \ game shows some improvements, I will consider removing this review. Please\
      \ contact me if you have updated your game and want a revision. https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/[/code]"
