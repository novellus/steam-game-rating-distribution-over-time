However a little difficult to control actually.  You have seen beat em ups, hack and slash and space shooters but this game hybrid combined feel a little odd actually. Sometimes no matter how many times I kill the special stones feels a little useless because it does not increase the special bar very fast. But that did not stop the fun. The pixel graphics are very beautiful and very cute including characters like Ninjin Akai even the Corgi. The story is pretty usual but in the end? That is really actually ta twist! Also the co op or going to a quick match feels empty. Best way to make the game fun is to invite a real friend who bought this game.","timestamp_created":1609993317,"timestamp_updated":1609993317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qI3F7fYCf/WXwQI="}
