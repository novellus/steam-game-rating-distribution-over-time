    about_the_game: BoxTheTop is a geometric intelligence game created by two independent
      developers.<br><br>Players try to estimate the number of boxes falling into
      an isometric area to increase their points. As certain scores are exceeded,
      players win different performance badges and the game level becomes more difficult.
      Each player gets a place in the overall score table according to their performance
      badges and score.<br><br><strong>PERFORMANCE BADGES</strong><br>The game has
      8 performance badges that are earned depending on the score the player has.
      Each badge game is a bit more difficult and allows the player to earn more points
      for each question. In this way, players can increase their positions in the
      rankings more quickly.<br><br><strong>LEADERBOARD</strong><br>The overall score
      table shows the top 3 players with the most points and the game owner's position
      in the ranking. Points earned at the end of each game change the player's overall
      score and position in the rankings.<br><br><strong>GAME</strong><br>When the
      game time starts, the boxes fall from the top to the platform and are arranged
      as isometrics. After the boxes are dropped, some boxes will not appear in the
      player's view, because they can remain behind other boxes, but they can be guessed
      by looking at the boxes on the bottom and side.<br><br>The number of boxes is
      estimated by pressing the numbers on the side and the user is shown on the screen
      whether the answer is correct or incorrect.<br><br>When the game time is over,
      the player's score is calculated and added to the total score. If the user does
      not have a performance badge, the scoring screen will be displayed in front
      of the player.<br><br>Have fun..

    review: 'I say once you figure out this game I reccomend this game! It challenges
      the mind for this casual game. It looks easy but once you get started it does
      get harder. the simple graphics make this game great for this style. Its not
      expensice so just buy it and challenge that mind. A+
