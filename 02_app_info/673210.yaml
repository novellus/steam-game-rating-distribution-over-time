    review: 'For an early access, this game is pretty good. It''s challenging to figure
      out how much distance you can get out of your batteries, figuring out the best
      trade routes, and even landing (I haven''t even attempted trying to land on
      runways because I''m fairly confident I''ll crash and burn, so I just land in
      vtol). You almost have to be... strategic about everything, which is nice.


      There aren''t many downsides so far... However, they need to figure out how
      to fully balance the burn rate for batteries/engines. One of my quests in the
      beginning was to go buy a ship on an island 70 km away, and my scarab, even
      with upgraded batteries, wasn''t able to make that distance (I even played around
      with thrust strength to make it last longer). Again, it''ll all come down to
      balance and other key factors.


      All in all, a really awesome early access and I''m looking forward to more updates.'
