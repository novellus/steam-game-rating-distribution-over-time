    review: Trine es un juego de plataformas y puzles en 2 Dimensiones que te lleva
      al lugar de un Mago, un guerrero y una ladrona cuyas almas son unidas por un
      objeto magico llamado el Trine. El juego dura unas 5 horas sin el nivel extra,
      una experiencia corta, pero entretenida, no por su historia, la cual para ser
      sinceros es bastante generica, sino por el simple entretenimiento que causa
      ir para adelante pasando por los obstaculos que se presentan en tu camino, matandolos
      con el caballero, usando magia para mover los objetos con el mago o colgandote
      y largando flechas con la ladrona. Una de las bellezas de este juego es su apartado
      artistico. Mas en la version Enchanted, que maneja unos escenarios hermosos
      sin exepciones en ningun nivel. El juego tampoco es muy caro, y en relacion
      calidad/precio el juego es muy bueno para su insignificante precio
