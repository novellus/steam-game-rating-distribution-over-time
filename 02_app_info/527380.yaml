    review: 'I am writing this not to talk about the game''s positives, but about
      its negatives, which are far more obvious and significant when playing.


      The game is divided into two campaigns, Ceres, the one you start on, and Mars.
      Each campaign is divided into sectors, and you must defeat each sector, which
      is one map. You control a small vessel and fly it in a side-on view. You can
      rotate and thrust your ship, and pick up and drop certain items. Your gun can
      fire in any direction, controlled by the mouse, and you have three secondary
      rockets or bombs. You have a mission, which varies each map: it might be to
      pick up a Marine APC from your ship and drop it in a certain location, or destroy
      three enemy targets, and so on. There are gun turrets which open and fire at
      you, pods that fire at you and are released from buildings, doors or shields
      that block progress, and sometimes you need to land on one platform to get a
      battery that you pick up and take to a socket. Nothing too complicated. As you
      complete each sector it brings you closer to completing the campaign. It also
      earns ''fleet resources'', which you can use to automatically win a sector,
      or to build improved weapons or ships. These are lost when you die though (you
      have three lives in a mission).


      So the gameplay is fairly simple and not very interesting, as are the graphics.
      Those in a sector are adequate, definitely looking like an earlier era, while
      the animated sequences, introducing the story, are just bad. Gameplay can be
      frustrating, since on harder missions you get swarmed by enemies, which cluster
      around you making it difficult to aim accurately or even move. Since they keep
      spawning from their silos it can be difficult to even reach the silos to destroy
      them.


      A lot of the achievements give you no idea what to do to achieve them, which
      is a major failing. Plus the bugs affect the achievements. I gained an achievement
      before I even started playing, and didn''t get one for completing the Ceres
      campaign without failing a mission.


      [h1]The Bugs, the bugs[/h1]

      You can fly through certain scenery. You can see an indicator of where your
      ship is, but you can''t see which way it is facing, which is crucial. Unless
      you immediately spin the ship around and thrust back out, there is a good chance
      you will get stuck somewhere ''behind'' the level, fruitlessly spinning and
      thrusting, trying to get the ship moving towards open space again.


      And the big one, the really big one is: you can''t play the Mars campaign. You
      can start it certainly, but as soon as you try to start the first mission the
      game crashes back to the desktop. This is such an utterly obvious problem that
      I cannot see how the developer did not fix it. He isn''t around any more to
      do anything about it.



      So for these reasons, this is very much a [b]thumbs-down[/b] to the game.'
