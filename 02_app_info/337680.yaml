    review: 'Overall the Star Hammer: The Vanguard Prophecy is disappointing. After
      completing the game on the "defensive scale" I found:

      - Achievements won''t always activate when completed while others only activate
      when you have beaten the campaign.

      - The ending is anticlimactic (at least on the defensive scale), while the rest
      of the story is largely forgettable.

      - The controls for ship energy output and weapons priority targeting can be
      tedious at times (more so if you have a larger fleet).

      - While the soundtracks are engaging at the start, there is approximately only
      9 soundtracks including the main menu (totalling at 30 minutes). After 4 hours
      of playing it can become somewhat repetitive.


      However there are some things that Star Hammer offers which are positive.

      - Character interactions during mission selection add much needed depth to the
      story.

      - Camera controls are precise and can be altered with a large degree of freedom
      (i.e free cam, top down, tracking on ships and the ability to review the last
      turn made).

      - Sound effects in large firefights are fairly immersive.'
