    review: 'The game has some really nice ideas with the genre mixing interspaced
      throughout the levels but it''s just not much fun after the novelty wears off
      and you''re left with the boring and trite gameplay for each section.


      I did like that gameplay mechanic where you went into a different gameplay mode
      to get a boost to get to a place you couldn''t get otherwise in another mode.
      That was ingenious. If you can get it cheap or in a bundle, check it out.'
