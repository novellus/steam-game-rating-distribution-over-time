    about_the_game: "Don\u2019t miss the single-player campaign from the game that\
      \ IGN awarded Best Xbox One Game of 2014, the game that Polygon rated 9 out\
      \ of 10, and the game that Eurogamer calls \u201Ca breath of fresh air.\u201D\
      \ In Sunset Overdrive, the year is 2027 and Sunset City is under siege. A contaminated\
      \ energy drink has transformed most of the population into toxic mutants. For\
      \ many it's the end of the world, but for you it\u2019s a dream come true. Your\
      \ old boss? Dead. Your boring job? Gone. Transform the open-world into your\
      \ tactical playground by grinding, vaulting and wall-running across the city\
      \ while using a devastating, unconventional arsenal. With hyper-agility, unique\
      \ weapons, and customizable special abilities, Sunset Overdrive rewrites the\
      \ rules of traditional shooters and delivers an explosive, irreverent, stylish,\
      \ and totally unique adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbrace the chaos of Sunset\
      \ City through a hyper-colorful, post-apocalyptic single-player campaign and\
      \ two bonus expansions, Mystery of Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen\
      \ Machines. Outgun crazed mutants, homicidal robots, and villainous thugs on\
      \ your journeys with the included Weapons Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br\
      \ />\r\n- An Open World with No Rules - Leap off buildings, run along walls,\
      \ and grind power lines and rails to destroy your foes from every angle.<br\
      \ />\r\n- Over-the-top Weapons - Collect and upgrade an arsenal of unconventional\
      \ weapons that use items like dynamite, fireworks, harpoons, and acid to destroy\
      \ your enemies."
