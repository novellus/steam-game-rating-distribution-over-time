It takes some moves in directions I like. The maps and other visuals that can be optionally added in were a really nice touch. The story starts off giving you so much information and it seems like you're going to be in for a long haul with tons of interesting twists.... and you are... until the end. From the point you reach your first possible \"ending\", the game just rushes towards a finish line in a way that is very boring. It's like the creator of this game put their heart and soul into writing the first 1/4 of a massive story they planned... and then all of a sudden realized that it was due for release the next day and just cobbled together a quick wrap-up at the very last second for the other 3/4 of the story. I recommend this one as its interesting and a concept I would LOVE to see thought out more in a follow-up, but I still can't give this higher than a 6/10.","timestamp_created":1607980865,"timestamp_updated":1607980865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.442028999328613281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43prIsfYCd/CdugI="}
