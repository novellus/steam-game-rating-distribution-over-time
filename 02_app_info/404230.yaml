    review: 'magix music maker 2013 had an at least stable layout, how were they able
      to make it even worse



      if its not for layout its just as bad as 2013, constant crashes, some options
      are not even possible to use or it crashes


      by the way just like 2013, checking "do not show this message again" on things
      doesnt change anything, they return anyway


      dont ever pay for this piece of crap neither all the other versions, if you
      want to make your original stuff or at least remix things this baby progam is
      nothing you want, begin with a better progam instead


      i wish i could get my money back for this bundle of trash'
