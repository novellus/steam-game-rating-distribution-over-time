    review: "Honestly this is my favorite HoldFast dlc as of right now, like dang\
      \ boiiiii the last 2 officer skins are so epic I actually feel so immersed while\
      \ playing officer when I have these skins equipped lmao. It also really nice\
      \ to finally not see the same officers over and over again lol.\n\nHoldfast\
      \ devs: releases a new dlc with amazing skins\nMe right away: tAke mY moNeY\
      \ rEEEEEEE\n\n\n\n10/10 would actually spend 20bucks on that third skin very\
      \ epic\n\n                                ||<Small Update>||\n\n100% should\
      \ create another officer skin based Holdfast dlc\n-with maaaaybe a Napoleon\
      \ based French officer skin"
