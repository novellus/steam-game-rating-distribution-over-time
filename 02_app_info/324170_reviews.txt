Way too much money for the very limited amount of time you can put into this game. The characters are very shallow and the main character is unlikable af. She just picks a fight with everyone she sees. She's way too competitive and from the very beginning sees 'normal civilians' as peasants not worth her time. It would've been fine had you played as her friend or something, but instead you're stuck playing as an annoying a*s b**ch. So... No would definitely not recommend this game to anyone","timestamp_created":1607119542,"timestamp_updated":1607119542,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw78Lyl/YCffystwI="}
