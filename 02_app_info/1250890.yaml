    review: I been with grimdawn since the early acess. And no matter how many times
      i make new charaters or travel the old roads. You always remember where you
      start in grimdawn. And the game greets you with good old Lament, a reflection
      of what your charaters actions, consquinces, or a silent prayer for the best
      and worst to come.
