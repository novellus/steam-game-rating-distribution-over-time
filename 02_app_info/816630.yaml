    review: "[b] \"Nell'oriente misterioso c'\xE8 un brigante generoso M...\" Inchia!\
      \ [/b]\nSe non altro arrivare al checkpoint del primo livello mi ha fatto rivalutare\
      \ la possibilit\xE0 di potermi cimentare con Dark Souls. Sul serio, mi piacerebbe\
      \ aggiungere qualche nota positiva, ma Monkey King: Master of Cloud, con la\
      \ sua difficolt\xE0 irragionevole, i suoi nemici dalla resistenza impressionante\
      \ (ve ne accorgerete per provare a far capolino nello shop dove potenziare il\
      \ vostro arsenale) ed i suoi scorrettissimi checkpoint (arrivati al primo boss\
      \ pregherete il signore per riuscire nell'impresa, per poi deprecarlo con disinvoltura\
      \ non appena scoprirete quanto vi \xE8 costato fallire, ritrovandovi nuovamente\
      \ a met\xE0 livello), \xE8 un gioco che non avrebbe dovuto lasciare il 1989,\
      \ e per questo, dopo averci anche riprovato, mi trovo addirittura a cambiare\
      \ giudizio, appiopandogli un pollice verso meritatissimo."
