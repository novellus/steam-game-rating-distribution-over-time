      \ Autos (nicht wie in Forza Horizen 4). Es macht Spa\xDF und ist auch gut f\xFC\
      r nicht leistungsstarke Ger\xE4te, um es locker mit 40 FPS und h\xF6her spielen\
      \ zu k\xF6nnen. Das einzig negative ist, das die Grafik zum W\xFCnschen l\xE4\
      sst aber dennoch in Ordnung geht..."
