It took me a while to figure out that I could upgrade my guns on the fly out in the world - you don't need to be at a special NPC or table.\n\nThe best aspect of the game is actually the post-apocalyptic mood. Steam reviewer \"de Woffels\" nails it, calling the world \"colorless\" and \"soulless.\" It's a game that actually feels somewhat oppressive to play. The blue color palette is overwhelming, and the seemingly-endless enemy respawns make walking anywhere feel tiresome. 460-E (Edward) does not naturally regenerate health, and must use either health kits or healers in town.\n\nThe flip side of this, however, is that walking anywhere FEELS tiresome. You're constantly running into jumps you can't make without more upgrades, analog locks you can't pick without more upgrades, and digital locks you can't hack without more upgrades. Initially I tried to make a mental note of the locations of these jumps and locks, but quickly became overwhelmed. The matter isn't helped by the fact that by the time you return, all of the enemies have respawned. I've never been much of a fan of metroidvania gameplay elements, so your mileage may vary here.\n\nOnce you have the ability to pick these locks and hack these doors and crates, things are still a slog. Hacking advanced computers is time-consuming, but so simple that it's trivial. Picking locks requires the ability to store a number of directional presses in your mind (often up to 7), so it's more difficult, but certainly not what I'd call satisfying. Many of these locked boxes hold mundane items, such as a clip for your rifle.\n\nI appreciate developer Mikkotheque's attempt to explore deeper topics, such as the humanity of Edward and the regrets of the Nova Concordia soldiers, but the low quality of the writing and the numerous typos removed any emotional investment for me.\n\nIf you want to take a chance and support an indie developer, you could do worse than Devastated. But in terms of unique gameplay and features, you could also do a lot better.","timestamp_created":1594408852,"timestamp_updated":1594408852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535398244857788086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoouLnfMCcpuylAI="}
