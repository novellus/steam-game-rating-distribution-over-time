I played it again and it is really cool now. The graphics are still strange, but it fits to the game. Check the new gameplay video. I can honestly say now, it is a fun game for a cheap price.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW\n\nIt is a wave-based shooter and ok, i have fun playing it. But there are too many things i dont like in the moment. The graphics are bad and wobbeling, the gunsounds are just a spoken phews. Because of both this, it is too less fun for me, and if it is humour, i do not like it. But maybe you, so just watch my gameplay video and see for yourself.\n\nGameplay video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_nzPqNY7zQM\n\n\n\nOld Gameplay video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/d9ANVff8iRc","timestamp_created":1595077403,"timestamp_updated":1598128205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zKX3i/QCe+eIlgI="}
