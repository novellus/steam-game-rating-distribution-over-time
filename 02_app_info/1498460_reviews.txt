The minigames aren't too terribly difficult (compared to others that I've seen in some games). I didn't need any hints and didn't use any skips. It just took some time to figure things out. \n\nThis game has a guide, including a section that shows where the collectibles are.\nIt has a map you can click on to travel and that shows where you've got activities you can do.\nIt has multiple difficulty settings\nI also has 2 types of collectibles (Glass globes and morphing objects)\nYou can also get other types of special items from completing the game.\nThere's an extra chapter, which was interesting.\n\nThe only negative I could find? The Mouse King's voice actor. It's like he just couldn't get interested enough to wake up and do his lines. Everything else was pretty and well done. I enjoyed the story, too. It's not what people are used to hearing when they hear about the Nutcracker. The story is significantly different.\n\nSo, yeah, if you like Hidden Object Games (HOG's) or point/click adventure games, this one is a good choice, especially if you want something that has a Christmas theme.","timestamp_created":1608614448,"timestamp_updated":1608614448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513888895511627197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuJG5xPYCd4yNvAI="}
