I would say that this game has A LOT of potential. I look forward to seeing how the game develops.  The programers have a great base going and it looks like they are progressing in the right direction.  \nI love that you are able to change the 'tooltip' size and adjust the number of voxels you are working on at once.  That will be very helpful when building a home/ base in the future.  \nThe programmers very clearly state that this game is a work in progress, and the purchase price is going toward developing the game.  It is clear that the game is not finished, so there should be no expectations to have a nearly finished product, or perfect game to run around in.  For anyone wanting to watch as a game is built, or to simply support game programmers, check out this game!","timestamp_created":1485734705,"timestamp_updated":1485734705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49o6s9tkCcbPpcA=="}
