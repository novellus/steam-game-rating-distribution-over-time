    review: "This game is weird\u2026most games don't make me feel so torn on my review.\
      \  I think the issue is so many individual parts in this game are fantastic\
      \ but the narrative holding up the overall game just doesn't work.  The art\
      \ direction is certainly great, the music is great, over all sound design is\
      \ fantastic.  As far as visual novels go this is a high quality one.  However,\
      \ to put it lightly the narrative doesn\u2019t make any sense.  \n\nThe overall\
      \ plot is that a secret division of the government handles monsters that are\
      \ created by people that suffer from depression/anxiety and other emotional\
      \ issues.  So that\u2019s fine\u2026but the game attempts to tell a murder mystery\
      \ without seemingly any evidence, suspects, or any narrative focus.  So that\u2019\
      s a problem.  \n\nLook, this game has a problem with a lot of murder mystery\
      \ games, the mystery can only be as good as the writer.  This game is basically\
      \ not a mystery or at least not a puzzle mystery.  No clues exist that allow\
      \ you to solve it.  The solution is utterly random and could have easily been\
      \ anything.  The game is also strange in that it doesn\u2019t seem to care about\
      \ this murder mystery\u2026at one point the game has a side plot about two children\
      \ that might be creating monsters and harming people\u2026which has nothing\
      \ to do with the main murder mystery plot.  This \u201Cside quest\u201D takes\
      \ quite a long time and this game is way too short for \u201Cside quests.\u201D\
      \  It feels like halfway through the creator decided to tell a different story.\n\
      \nAfter that section you then go into the end game and it feels extremely rushed\
      \ and nonsensical.  The ending itself seemed to have no connection to any decisions\
      \ I made throughout the game and ended basically before I could blink.  It feels\
      \ like the creator ran out of money and had to finish things up real fast. This\
      \ games plot needed room to breathe and it wasn\u2019t given any.  The ideas\
      \ the narrative brought up in the last 30min needed to be stretched out over\
      \ probably 30hrs\u2026not 30mins.\n\nNormally, I would write a review going\
      \ deep into spoilers and explain why exactly the plot has severe issues\u2026\
      but it\u2019s just too exhausting to do for this game.  I literally could not\
      \ begin to explain all the issues with the plot\u2026it\u2019s a mess.  It\u2019\
      s a shame because the characters, the character relationships/romances, the\
      \ music, the art direction, the sound design\u2026basically everything else\
      \ in this visual novel is great and if the plot worked this would be a must\
      \ buy.  It really just feels like this game was not finished\u2026at all. Hopefully\
      \ this developers next game has a much stronger focus on a cohesive narrative.\
      \  \n\nHonestly, I think the real issue is the setting of a secret government\
      \ division hunting down monsters with a murder mystery central plot.  This game\
      \ should have been a supernatural romance game with no murder mystery and the\
      \ secret government agency should have been more geared toward just investigating\
      \ why spirits are appearing instead of a paramilitary organization.  What this\
      \ game clearly cares about are the actual characters and the emotions they feel\
      \ and this narrative greatly hampers that."
