    review: 'You''d be surprised but for a zombie type game this is fairly original.

      Let me explain.


      [h1] Weapon Originality [/h1]


      Most zombie games would throw guns at you, and to get weapons you have to pay
      for them.

      In this game you have melee weapons and to find them you need to search around
      the map, or find them from random generation.


      [h1] BUGS [/h1]


      Bugs are noticeable but not outright making the game unplayable. These bugs
      I often notice playing with friends and can be annoying, but Early Access game
      is gonna Early Access game.


      [h1] The Level Editor [/h1]


      Level editors can be confusing, especially with 3D level editors, but it''s
      not hard when you understand it. I really do encourage people to make maps especially
      with the low amount giving lots of potential for originality. There are bugs
      within the Level Editor, like the menu breaking to unknown reasons and blocks
      automatically inverting, but those are redeemable with a simple save button.
      (Thank god those bugs don''t crash games)


      I give this game a:


      [b] 7/10 [/b]


      I recommend you try this game out if you''re looking to buy it with some spare
      change.'
