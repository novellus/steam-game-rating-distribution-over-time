I really struggle with elbow pieces, and imagining how they move. it often feels like the only way to find a solution is to exhaust movement options, because trying to \"see ahead\" logically is incredibly difficult.\n\nstill very good, and a very interesting, if agonizing puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1609640904,"timestamp_updated":1609640904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510155320167541504","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1OCE4/YCf7D3vwI="}
