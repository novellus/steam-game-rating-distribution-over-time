Don't get it confused with the \"pre-release\" version that was basically a demo for the full release, spanning only a few areas. When you research the mod, you may end up reading about the pre-release without knowing it. The full version includes a number of play hours across many different cities, although none nearly as large as the OC or Persistent Worlds. Some of the voice-acting is superb and on-point, most is average, and just a little is off-target, but across the board the writing is good. You will encounter a number of locales and figures from the Moonsea region in Faerun that are mostly true to the lore while not being too \"cheesy\". I'd pick this one up on sale and make sure to get through the first \"1/3\" of the campaign, which is by far the slowest. It opens up after a certain point. Note this is a high-level adventure, and is actually fairly tough. You can't get by with a \"role-play\" oriented toon; you'll need to use all the tools at your disposal, and need to build for combat. There are a number of difficult boss encounters, and the final boss fight is absolutely at the apex of high-level challenge. You can't sleep-walk through combat in this adventure.\n\nBads:\n* Some voice-acting is off beat and doesn't fit the rest of the content well, and sort of reminds you that it's 3rd party content.\n* It's an intensely high-level campaign; you need to build yourself and your party for combat, and need to micro quite a bit in some boss encounters. While this is a plus overall, some encounters feel like they could have used more tuning for the actual level of the PC.\n* Starts off real slow, plot picks up, thickens and feels more \"epic\" later on.\n* Ends with a partial cliff-hanger, almost like there was too much content to pack into this one campaign.\n\nGoods:\n* Depicts a number of locales, cities and villains in the Moonsea, which is a pretty cool region. Depictions are reasonably faithful, although creative liberty is used quite a bit.\n* Memorable party members and villains (although not quite as memorable as SoU, HoU, Baldur's Gate, etc)\n* Meaty. At least 10-15 hours of play-time, much more if you go at a reasonable pace and complete all extra content\n* A number of new models, tiles and sound-tracks. New models and sound-tracks are particularly impressive.\n* High-level adventure that is -mostly- balanced. There aren't as many of these for NWN; most adventures are low-level.\n\nVerdict:\n* Recommend picking this up on sale if you're interested in a meaty high-level adventure in the Moonsea region.","timestamp_created":1601141843,"timestamp_updated":1601141843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540084421634674072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w7Tf5fQCe4ifpAI="}
