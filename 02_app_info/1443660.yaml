    about_the_game: <strong>Sven Gerlach, composer of the Dead Age 2 soundtrack</strong><br>&quot;The
      apocalyptic atmosphere of the Dead Age 2 soundtrack comes from the depths of
      my heart, creating longing atmospheres, coupled with a feeling of hope and darkness
      at once. The sound of minor chords always was my favorite. The special part
      about this soundtrack is the pairing of modern sounds and beats, which support
      the battle scenes and give them even more depth. Every single track tells its
      own story. If you want to join this journey, take your headphones and listen
      with closed eyes...&quot;
