It goes beyond just simulating the game itself, it goes beyond by adding a lobby and various maps that spice the game up. Even the lobby is quite creative, I liked the for example the small detail that you start up a map by throwing a dedicated bowl for said maps into pins. Of course, this doesn’t feel *exactly* like an irl bowling, as there is (unsurprisingly) no weight in the balls you’re throwing, so you’ll need to get used to how throw “weightless” balls, but once you get the gist of it it’s a fun game.\n\nThe maps themselves are quite nicely done - there’s a jungle one where you can hit snakes and spires that decided to stroll through the bowling lane uninvited and you even get extra points for doing so. There’s a sky jump map where you can just relax and watch how your ball picks up extra snow and bulks up as it rolls down the hill. There’s an abandoned factory one which has a changing environment that goes from day to night as you progress through your game and has a horror atmosphere better than some dedicated horror vr games I’ve played. And my personal favourite, the creepy carnival map that even has some bonus interactions as you can have a ride on a ferris wheel or a carousel. Those maps are also surprisingly detailed, as their area is far beyond what would be needed just for the bowling lane. This is true especially for the jungle map where most of the map isn’t even visible unless you decide to take a walk behind the bowling lane. I commend this effort. Well, as you might have noticed this is a bit more gimmicky bowling, so if you’re looking only for a serious, regular simulation of this sport this game might not be for you.\n\nThat said, there are two main downsides. First – the game takes way too long to load with no justifiable reason. This is the worst for starting up the game and for starting up the first map, it’s the loading is much better for subsequent map changing. It’s even worse for the first map loading as there isn’t even any loading indicator there, so you’re just kind of sitting there with no indication on how more time it will take hoping the game didn’t just crash and is in fact still loading (as a note Amaze Bowl did not crash even once for me, but it sure felt like it could). Second, the game seems to be abandoned and further development or even leaving the early access mode should not be expected. There is an item shop in the main lobby that says “coming soon in 2018”, which as you might guess by the date of this review did not happen. The game is playable without a problem in its current stay though, so it’s not that bad (I can’t confirm that about the multiplayer mode which I haven’t tried).\n\nOverall, it’s a nice game and for such a low price it’s certainly worth it. 6.7/10\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1594118524,"timestamp_updated":1594118524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5029754638671875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxsm3lPMCfL7AkwI="}
