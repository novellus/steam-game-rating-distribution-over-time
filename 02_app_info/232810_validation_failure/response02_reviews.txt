Thought it could change, it didn't. They took everyone's money, pushed out the bare minimum, 22cans ran off to do other things (They might not even be around anymore) under the direct leadership of Peter and he left what was basically an intern to \"finish\" the game. What the intern did instead was push out a sort of PVP type game and did fuck all for the game it was based on. Feeling the pressure they turned around and claimed the game \"done\" and that was that. Been radio silent for years now. Close to a decade if i remember correctly. \n\nPM is an Ideas person. Borderline scam artist, worst of all he knows this. He rarely speaks to the press now because he knows he has a nasty habit of lying, making stuff up or mentioning plans that were scrapped as if they will be in the finial game. \n\n22Cans and the devs that worked there when this game was considered \"Done\" should be ashamed of themselves. They knew it wasn't and yet they quite clearly didn't care. They could of quit, They could of said something, They could of demanded the game be done. Instead, they went along with PM's con. complicit to it all. \n\nThe Industry will never change so long as the people that work in remain silent all the time. If I work in a factory and make something of sub-par quality, even if i was just following orders, I get in trouble. Why should software engineers be not hold to that same standard? Because they don't get paid much? That's on them. They are the ones that went to a Technology Academy and then turned around and ran directly into an Art job.","timestamp_created":1393040135,"timestamp_updated":1609756693,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459923475980758667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4oLq+5vYCdsySIw=="}
