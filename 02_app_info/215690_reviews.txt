A decent variety in enemies and mechanics make for a fun run through the weird ass environments that make up the world\n-World is relatively small in scale, but is built to be an extension off of the first game, and the story justifies why your world is so bizarre, dangerous, and beautiful all at once, and each area feels the way they should.\n- Voice acting is 50/50, some characters have much better sounding dialogue than others, but you will know who is more central to the plot based on how clear their voices are.\n-Exploration and sidequest stuff is handled by multiple small collectible sets, once you finish collecting an item, you go to a specific place and receive a bonus you can use for the rest of the playthrough.\n\nOverall, Zeno Clash 2 is a strong 7/10, worth playing for the experience, Coop just helps make it more memorable.","timestamp_created":1609133813,"timestamp_updated":1609133813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40K320/YCe5GAvgI="}
