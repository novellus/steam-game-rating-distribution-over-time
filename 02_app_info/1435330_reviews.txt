Though there is one side-quest I haven't finished yet). Overall, I really enjoyed the game! I liked the stylized cartoony visuals and the fun Halloween aesthetic! The different Hallowmon were unique looking, and interesting. The open-world is large enough to make it interesting to explore, and the side-quests were also fun. The story being told is intriguing as well, and I of course won't spoil anything in this review. The extra things you can get by collecting candy is nice too, such as unique trails, and a really cool retro-effect. I've had a ton of fun with this game, and I believe that I will continue to enjoy it! I also cannot wait to see what Stratton Studios creates next!\n\nThere is only one complaint I really have about the game, and it isn't too bad. While there are many unique Hallowmon to get in the game, by the end of it I found myself primarily sticking to the first one you get, Turtairy. Turtairy became strong enough to essentially one-hit any threat I came across, excluding Hallowmon types that it is in-effective against, though Turtairy could still beat them with ease. Because of this I never entirely felt the need to switch Hallowmon. Evenstill, this was only really an issue in the late-game, and doesn't effect the main story much at all.","timestamp_created":1607711354,"timestamp_updated":1607711354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560439586639404297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyY3EqfYCdNWWuQI="}
