    review: "I am officially in a lost here. After reading all the favourable reviews\
      \ I was expecting\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. Something. \n\nIt starts as\
      \ a legitimate (although not really original) coming of age story with a decent\
      \ (although not really abundant) number of choices. But after your would be\
      \ magic teacher arrives, story quickly downgrades into a third-rate fantasy\
      \ time-killer read. And when I say \u201Cread\u201D, I really mean it: you have\
      \ to read 3-4 walls of text to get from one choice to another \u2013 and these\
      \ are mostly binary choices we are talking about.  And if only it was good text;\
      \ but oh, no, it\u2019s mostly a futile attempts to be dramatic, mixed with\
      \ what author takes for humor. And humor is only laughable in a sense that it\
      \ fails to get a single smile from you despite all the efforts. And believe\
      \ me, there is a lot of attempts. On the other hand, what it (the humor; or\
      \ the author, both variants are correct) actually manage to do, is to made what\u2019\
      s left of choices basically a gamble: you make a choice, and then watch how\
      \ the author changes it into a literal opposite with his \u201Cwit\u201D.\n\
      No, when I say \u201CI wear dress I usually wear to church\u201D I don\u2019\
      t mean \u201Cdull grey-brown puritanical rags that covers me from head to toes\u201D\
      . I mean \u201Cthe very best dress I have\u201D. Cause it\u2019s a CHURCH, the\
      \ only place where THE WHOLE VILLAGE gathers = place, where all the local youths\
      \ dress on to show off. Have you ever been to country, eh?.."
