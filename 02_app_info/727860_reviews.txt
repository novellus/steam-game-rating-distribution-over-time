I cannot recommend this game in its current state.\n\nThe authors do not seem to speak English as their first language, as there are grammar errors which cause the meaning of the questions to be off or misleading.\n\nThe name of the game is misleading also, as the quizzes often have nothing to do with space. I ran into several that were fraction questions in the form of a sentence. Compounded that with the grammar problems, and several questions were obscure at best.","timestamp_created":1546883383,"timestamp_updated":1546883383,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47efblOgCcoHitwE="}
