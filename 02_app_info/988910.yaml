    review: I originally bought this game because it looked alright and there's no
      other baseball games on PC. I was initially put off by the lack of licensed
      teams and the cartoonish art style. I went with a custom league, with custom
      teams, and I've been playing for over 200 hours and loving it. The back end
      team management is a bit too simple, and in my opinion would benefit by being
      fleshed out, but the gameplay is very slick, responsive, and rewarding. I don't
      play online, so I can't comment on that. but if you are a fan of baseball, I
      think there's something here to enjoy. It's a great game for quick pop ins without
      a lot of time commitment.
