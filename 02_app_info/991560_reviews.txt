Do you like loading screens? THEN HAVE I GO A GAME FOR YOU!\n\nSeriously though, this game is a hot mess. There's a lot of baffling design decisions you could spend a lot of time discussing and not even get close to the actual fighting mechanics of this fighting game. But for me the breakpoint was the loading times. And to be clear I'm not exactly running a potato here. But the amount of time you spend in this game just waiting to do things. Start the game, wait for it load, change areas, wait for that to load, run over to the pc who's giving out missions and the wait for them to load in as well. Then wait for the mission select screen and then, finally, you can wait for the actual fight to load. And you better hope you're not doing a story mission because get what happens if there's any cutscenes or additional stages? The problem with all this hanging around is that the actual fights can be over in less time than it takes to get them. And honestly they're... not that great. I'm no connoisseur of fighting games, but it mostly seems to come down to whoever stun locks or juggle combos the other person first. Can be OK as a bit of button mashing fun, except it's simply not worth the wait.\n\nThe character creator deserves a mention as it's actually pretty good. Not quite City Of Heroes (RIP) levels of great, but pretty much everything you fight in game is made with it so it does provide some variety. But honestly it could do with more options for making actual super heroes. Even most of the unlockable options are just normal clothes.\n\nThere's several pieces of DLC and I did get the season pass, but honestly they don't seem to add much to the game. There's only one that I even got as far as accessing the missions for and they're just like what you get in the main game: A couple of short fights against random monsters and maybe after you'll get some extra costume pieces or whatever assuming you have the patience to wait for them to LOAD.\n\nThe weird tacked on online features are honestly not even worth talking about since they don't really seem to impact the game in any meaningful way. Outside of the strange hub structure of the town. It's like they wanted this to be an MMO or something, but had no clue how that would even work with a fighting game. The answer there being it doesn't, concentrate on something the game actually needs. Like optimisation.","timestamp_created":1610011614,"timestamp_updated":1610011614,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws/OK7vYCerKdwQI="}
