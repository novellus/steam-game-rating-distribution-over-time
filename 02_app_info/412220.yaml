      \ you behind in the dust. We've developed DDNet for over 7 years now and made\
      \ it greater than ever! It has been free-to-play and free-to-win since development\
      \ started and will always stay free. It's also open source, so everyone is invited\
      \ to help improve it with great new ideas!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollect cool weapons,\
      \ each with their own purpose, and use them to save your teammates. Use your\
      \ grappling hook to climb through tunnels and up mountains. DDNet requires a\
      \ lot of skill, coordination and practice. Our friendly online community will\
      \ help you fall in love with this unique cooperative game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
