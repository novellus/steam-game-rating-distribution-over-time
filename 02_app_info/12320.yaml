    review: "Sacred war vor 12 Jahren das erste RPG, das ich gespielt habe und selbst\
      \ im Jahr (mittlerweile) 2021 ist und bleibt es mein absoluter Favorit. \nEs\
      \ beweist, dass man keine HD Grafik braucht um ein tolles Spielerlebnis und\
      \ eine grandiose Atmosph\xE4re zu liefern."
