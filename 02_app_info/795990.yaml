    review: This game is one of the unique gaming experiences I had for the last years.
      But it is obviously not for everyone. Who will like it?[hr][/hr] If you are
      much into space flying/trading simulators like Elite Dangerous, X series etc.,
      and you want to bring it to a next, much more realistic level, this game might
      be for you.[hr][/hr] What is Rise? It is mostly airplane/spaceship simulator
      placed in future on a moon which is being colonized. If you have some experience
      in Microsoft Flight Simulator or X-Plane it will help you a lot because this
      simulator is realistic. Different planes every with its own flight model, some
      with vertical t/o capability and everything in realistic physics. You will need
      some piloting skill or you can learn these skills during gameplay. But it's
      not only about flying in the atmosphere. Some ships will allow you for a suborbital
      and even orbital flight to the space stations. So basic knowledge of orbital
      flight is needed as everything is modelled correctly in Newtonian physics. If
      you have experience in Orbiter or even in Kerbal Space Program it will be very
      helpful. If not - you will have to learn it.[hr][/hr] Now while mentioned simulators
      only give you possibility to fly your own scenario, Rise also simulates your
      career. You start as a poor colonist who has to literally drive taxi to earn.
      Soon you will be able rent a truck and start hauling vehicles or do some basic
      trading. From that it's very soon to renting first flying vehicle, which will
      allow you to visit nearby colonies and earn much more on trading. Now I must
      admit here that car driving might not be very appealing, as the city seems empty
      without AI traffic, but it really works well for the immersion and also as basic
      guide before you start to understand how the game mechanics work. At that time
      you can also use a simulator to get the feel of flying.[hr][/hr] As a more endgame
      activity you can build your own colonies. You will first have to find a good
      spot which is rich either in some rare materials or fuel ore and then you can
      build your first mine. You will also need to have a farm to feed the colonists
      and a town if you want to future refine your ore and basic materials into more
      valuable stuff. The game is an online MMO and whole economy is player driven.
      Everyone sets their own prices hoping that other pilots will supply their colonies
      with stuff they need and buying their products. Nothing is scripted here. People
      can form alliances or even make some economical wars, for example setting up
      dumping prices to shut down other enterprises. Unfortunately the player base
      is small mostly because the game is difficult and requires a lot of effort to
      get into.[hr][/hr] The game interface might be a bit puzzling at first but actually
      it is pretty effective. Most of the stuff is done either by context menu or
      by writing in the computer window. Again it gives a lot of immersion. For example
      if you want to load some stuff to a cargo hold you will have to write something
      like "1+10" which will mean to put 10 tones into bay 1. I really like that idea
      because it feels more realistic than just moving some sliders on a menu. There
      is also so much attention put into little details. For example if you want to
      build a mine, you will first have to visit a place where you buy the land, then
      you will have to buy or rent a container which will suit your new project, then
      you have to visit a company which will put a mine project inside. Then you bring
      it to your spot and deploy. Next you will have to supply it with needed materials
      and personnel, or pay others to do it for you. With enough materials you can
      now order your workers to build certain elements of the mine like extractors,
      separators, storage buildings etc. It's very fun to see how it grows and how
      your products affect the global economy. If you for example buy an ATM for your
      colony, so people can get cash from their account to buy stuff from you, you
      will have to put some money inside. That is the level of detail involved.[hr][/hr]
      The game itself is more or less a hobby project developed for many years. Therefore,
      the graphics may look outdated but it's not for the graphics itself why you
      play the game. And some views, especially sun setting from the orbit are just
      beautiful. The game even though advertised as in alpha state is fully playable
      but in the same time still developed. You may be sure it won't be abandoned,
      because people involved in development also love to play it themselves. They
      are very open to discussion and any opinions. The game is connected to a discord
      server and you will spend a lot of time talking with them, learning the stuff
      and giving your own ideas.[hr][/hr] The game is made by people with some real
      life aviation background and you can really see it. You can do ILS approaches
      and there is even ATC which will vector you to the airfield. But also the economy
      model is very realistic with a lot of attention into details. While flying similar
      routes may seem to get boring quickly it's not, because every flight is different.
      The plane will behave differently depending on how much cargo and fuel it is
      carrying. Depending on distance your suborbital flights will look different.
      You will get better at planing a good and not so very hot re-entry every time.
      It's so fun to see how your skills in piloting increase and so how does your
      bank account. As the game is MMO there is no time compression. You will sometimes
      have to wait for example for a take-off window to a space station and flights
      may take from few minutes to even few hours. It's designed for hardcore simmers
      but it's really worth the effort.[hr][/hr] One drawback of the game might be
      the fact that there is no real manual for it and the game is difficult with
      a steep learning curve. There is a wiki which gives a lot of information but
      it doesn't explain everything in detail. You will have to ask people about certain
      things, how they are done and how they work. So you need to be prepared for
      some serious learning. If you don't like it and just want to get straight into
      action, the game is not for you, so be aware of that. Fortunately the small
      community is very helpful and will explain everything to you. If you are in
      doubt there is a fully playable free demo available. Go ahead and try it. You
      are only limited by no possibility to build your own colonies, but as I mentioned
      this is more an endgame activity so you really don't need it at the start. If
      you get the hang of the game, you can also later buy the full version.[hr][/hr]
      To quickly summarize. Rise is an amazing spaceship/spaceplane simulator focusing
      mostly on trading and colony management in realistic, player driven economy.
      The game is difficult but the effort to learn it is well worth it. I highly
      recommend it to every serious simmer.
