    review: "This game isn't great. It's not the worst you could do for 15 smackaroons,\
      \ but I would definitely recommend getting other games for similar money. For\
      \ every positive thing I have to say, there's at least as many negative things\
      \ to say about it.\nIt takes heavily from Gungeon, a little bit from Nuclear\
      \ Throne in terms of progression and level layout, and effectively lifted several\
      \ bosses straight from Enter the Gungeon but did it worse.\n\nExplosions have\
      \ damage radius inconsistent with the spritework, especially those little warning\
      \ markers from airstrikes. You'll frequently take bullshit damage when you were\
      \ visibly outside of an explosion's radius.\nThe gameplay itself isn't bad,\
      \ just kind of okay. \nThe music seems like it was ripped from flash games,\
      \ though I have nothing to prove this. I would have to take a look at the credits.\
      \  I swear I've heard at least two of the most common tracks in a flash game\
      \ before.\n\nGame's not bad, but it feels like a flash game with all of the\
      \ jank that entails.\n\nOh, also, the game crashes toward the final stages of\
      \ a run. A lot."
