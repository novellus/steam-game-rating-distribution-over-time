      /><br><br>In HueBots, you have a colorful inventory of robots and blocks you
      can build. You can spawn robots and move them around; however, they will keep
      moving in one direction until they collide with something that matches their
      color. Use your block inventory to create stopping points for your bots. Use
      your robots to unlock doors, push away blocks, shift colors, and work as a team
      to help aid your special black and white robot to the finish!<br><br>HueBots
      includes 70 main levels in the game, plus 30 bonus levels that can be unlocked
      by completing various achievements (e.g. beating certain levels with leftover
      blocks in your inventory).<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/397400/extras/Header-CustomLevels-Small.png?t=1583944136"
      /><br><br>HueBots includes an easy-to-use level editor so you can create your
      own puzzles, too. Building a level is as simple as using a paint program - pick
      a color and an object, and use the mouse to place down objects.
