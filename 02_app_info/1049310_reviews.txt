Levels arenâ€™t just thrown together but well thought out and often present a challenge and make great use of the switching between twins mechanic. The music compliments everything going on and all in all backpack twins is a satisfying title to play.","timestamp_created":1568655788,"timestamp_updated":1568655788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/vjKne0Cd8Kt0gE="}
