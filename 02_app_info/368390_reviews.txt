From witty pop culture and literature references to the elbow-nudge-and-snicker toilet jokes, The Darkside Detective has it all.  With an easy to learn gameplay system and excellently atmospheric soundtrack to boot.\n\nI bought this game on sale, but frankly, I wish I'd paid full price.  This game is worth that for the amount of times I couldn't help but laugh at the horrifically bad puns.","timestamp_created":1609821889,"timestamp_updated":1609821889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4npS36PYCc5LNwAI="}
