    review: "[h1] The First Review [/h1]\nThe thing that makes or breaks a game. \n\
      I'm conflicted. An experience is set from the parameters allowed in a situation.\
      \ This games main feature, cannot currently be enjoyed. Because an online multiplayer\
      \ party game (not unlike the currently popular Fall \"shortstack\" guys) requires\
      \ other people have bought and are willing to play this game. Unfortunately,\
      \ this casual party game, has never, and unfortunately unless this review can\
      \ persuade people, will never have enough people playing it for the game to\
      \ take off. Sounds fine, and all, but you're here for the gameplay.\n\n[h1]\
      \ The Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the non-VR version of a conceptually great idea.\
      \ It's VR (or in this case non-VR) version of Bumper Cart, where one uses Capitalist\
      \ greed to get a higher score than your opponent. Game-play takes place in various\
      \ \"shopping\" environments. The character, armed with 2 scanners, is tasked\
      \ with competing with opponents for highest score based on cash value. Points\
      \ are achieved by either \"buying\" (shooting) opponents, collecting valuables\
      \ (which replace your scanners or weapons), or eliminating opponents by using\
      \ \"collected\" (scanned) weapons against your opponents. \nAt the end of a\
      \ round, the characters points \"cash value\" is totaled up to figure out who\
      \ won. \n\n[h1] Good Fantasy [/h1]\nThis fantasy setting, is the only safe and\
      \ appropriate reality to experiment with capitalism, without worrying about\
      \ the racist, fascist, backlash that usually occurs with these awful situations.\
      \ Anyway, I would love to show this game off at parties, and I'm hoping this\
      \ review convinces people to play it, and start multiplayer servers.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\
      Buy the game, play the game.\nMaybe other people will play it with you."
