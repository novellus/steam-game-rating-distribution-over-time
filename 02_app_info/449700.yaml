    review: "Its better then fallout and any other survival game. It involves getting\
      \ food, water, weapons, keys and more. The game still is laggy but it does not\
      \ get in the way of gameplay. You can shoot down enemys and more! But the only\
      \ bad thing is that if you want to change the video settings (which you should)\
      \ it infrequently doesent respond. So just wait a few seconds and it will come\
      \ back on. \n\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nGameplay 5/10\n\nFun 10/10\n\nStory  10/10\n\
      \nVoice acting 2/10\n\nLag 5/10"
