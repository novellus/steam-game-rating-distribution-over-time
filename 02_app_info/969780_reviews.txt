Perfect for Action and Horror [Oct 12, 2020]\n\nSo, a quick breakdown: this product is able to be used in Commercial and Non-Commercial products (ie you CAN sell the game you use them in, so long as you give appropriate credit), and it can be used in any game engine, as far as I have seen in its terms and conditions! These packs aren't very clear and upfront about it before you purchase, so I wanted to clear the air on that in case that's keeping folks from purchasing.\nTK Projects is pretty awesome about it from what I've seen thus far.\n\nSound design is super underrated in games, and until I actually started putting my VN together, I had focused more on music than sound effects. Then I found myself desperately searching the internet for royalty-free sound effects that didn't suck to compensate for my terrible Folly equipment! Doesn't matter HOW good you are at writing -- it's tough to bring a visual action scene to life with descriptions and moving busts alone.\n\nThen I remembered this pretty lil pack. \nVery happy thus far! There's so much to choose from, and enough variations to keep scenes from being repetitive!\n\nThe reason I've put a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is a small issue: the .ogg and .m4a files work 100% fine in my recording software, but for some reason, the \"Destruction and Weapons\" SE's will not play in VN Maker for me as of October 12, 2020 (happy turkey day). I know the files do actually work, I just gotta figure out this lil issue and then it's 100% perfect!\n\nLong story short, I really do recommend this pack for those who want to bring their scenes to life!","timestamp_created":1602546493,"timestamp_updated":1602546493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45NzNj/UCdIDFpwI="}
