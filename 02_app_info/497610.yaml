    review: 'With NATO as default playable side of this scenario player could ride
      a rollercoaster car of delivering several various waves of deadful strikes to
      Crimean Penisula.

      With Russia as playable side you could find yourself with a heavy lossses in
      the beginning of game when Russian weapon of Russian side fights Russian weapon
      of radical Ukrainian side.

      With radical Ukraine as computer played side score simply get counted up with
      every own unit destroyed without victory or defeat conditions.


      If to put aside all the insane drama in the scenario briefing, I found this
      scenario useful to bringing my attention to the region, resulted in advancing
      few very busy in-game hours, noticing F16 Falcons able to get close at 200 ft
      ASL, below reach of missile defense, popping out over Cape of Chersones and
      releasing their deadly load over the city of Sevastopol. And this is brilliant
      that game''s AI able to use weapon specs to get this advantage. The other thing
      I value much is when I tried to compare military assets with satellite imagery,
      I actually looked in Google maps and spend some time observing the cleanly noticeable
      over civillian structures, remains of former Red Banner Black Sea Soviet Fleet
      assets, noticing there was no hot or frozen war, but only 25 years passed to
      make them almost non-existent.


      I am not agree with the role of Russia in this scenario nor I see it is somehow
      truthworthy brief given nor I believe scenario is realistic in any point, but
      I pressing ''Recommend'' to let people try it and to think about all that.'
