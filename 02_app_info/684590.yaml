    review: "I really wanted to like this since I really enjoy short indie rpg's with\
      \ pixel graphics. Quick breakdown of the aspects that made me turn it off:\n\
      \n[list]\n    [*] Recycled interiors with minor changes, lot's of locked doors\n\
      \    [*] Quest log with little detail about where you originally picked up the\
      \ quest and not enough motivation to revisit every location asking around\n\
      \    [*] Short storyline dialogue among party members and long-winded lore found\
      \ on the bookshelves\n    [*] No leveling up, instead you grind to buy new equipment\
      \ and grind to buy potions that add extra stats to your party members\n    [*]\
      \ Each time you equip something you have to reselect a character and then a\
      \ slot and then equipment again, it backs you out each time (it's nitpicky,\
      \ but annoying if you want to equip multiple things in one go, which you are\
      \ often doing)\n    [*] Little motivation to utilize the games magic system,\
      \ I was able to fight my way through using melee alone.\n    [*] Sometimes checking\
      \ fireplaces and pots yields items or \"kupons\", but most times it yields the\
      \ same canned responses over and over again. Of course in the first house I\
      \ tried checking the fireplace and it said \"They will probably light it later\
      \ at night\" it felt like flavor text. After the twentieth house it was annoying.\
      \ \n[/list]\n\nI do like the art, and the mapping isn't too bad either. The\
      \ party members were diverse and while they weren't very deep, they weren't\
      \ flat either. If I had the time to sit down and play from start to finish I\
      \ might enjoy it more but I found myself frustrated with the quest log being\
      \ too ambiguous. When you only get a few hours a week to spend on gaming, it's\
      \ not fun to backtrack for sidequests and find out the reward was a magic item\
      \ you don't even need to use."
