    review: "Fantastic software for tracking/monitoring processes and traffic. \n\
      I was looking for an app like this for a while to identify apps were connecting\
      \ to the internet.\nThis is the only easily accessible software that makes it\
      \ easy and quick to identify which process is trying to connect where and the\
      \ amount of traffic transferred in real time.\nThe only thing missing is the\
      \ ability to easily and quickly block IP's as simple as as processes.\n\n\n\n\
