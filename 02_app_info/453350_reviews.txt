The dialogue is laughably awful and cliche'd. The beginning is extremely slow and boring, the controls even on a 360 controller with the duck and cover and aim system all mushed together make you have to hold the most awkward controller positions together. All the enemies look the same, the plot doesn't really make sense or feel believable, and to top it all of there's this menacing stereotypical bad guy all \"grrr my evil plans to mess with the city\" crap while in a samurai suit of armor... in Spain... in the 1930s... Yeah I'm done.","timestamp_created":1489712419,"timestamp_updated":1489712419,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58105158805847168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i/Lx7NoCe6LKdA=="}
