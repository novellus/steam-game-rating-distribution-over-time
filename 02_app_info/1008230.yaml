      in her late mothers footsteps to become a great Witch. So she left her home
      with only a map, her small amount of savings and some stories to guide her on
      the journey. Wilder Village was her destination, often told of as an idyllic
      village that borders the dangerous and awe inspiring 'Great Wilderness'.  After
      months of travel the protagonist has finally arrived...<h2 class="bb_tag">Wilder
      Village &amp; The Great Wilderness</h2><br>The village houses a selection of
      locations you can visit and people you can meet and work with whilst exploring
