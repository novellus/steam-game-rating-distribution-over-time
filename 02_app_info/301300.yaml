    about_the_game: I remember the day of the invasion well. The memories still burn
      deeply, like <strong>spicy chicken wings</strong>.<br><br>They came without
      warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. <strong>Invading
      intergalactic chickens</strong>, out to punish humanity for our oppression of
      their earthly brethren.<br><br>I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped
      my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger
      I set my lasers to <strong>&quot;extra crispy&quot;</strong> and blasted off
      to intercept the fowl invaders.<br><br>It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying,
      the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time
      with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence
      they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this
      planet.<br><br>After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger
      to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat
      down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.<br><br>Little
      did I know that my <strong>greatest adventure</strong> was yet to come...

    short_description: They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled
      feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity
      for our oppression of their earthly brethren. Now they're back, and they're
