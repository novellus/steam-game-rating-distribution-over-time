My mom asked me if I wanted to play, so we entered the place. My father was never interested in games, but wanted to see me happy. My mother instead is a gamer, she likes point and click games and puzzles. \n\nI immediately noticed Three Wonders, a 3-in-1 arcade game that maybe not many of you know. Basically you insert the coin and you can choose between a platformer, an horizontal shootemup and an action puzzle, all great full-fledges games. The puzzle game was called Don't Pull. \n\nI was already familiar with the game, so we entered and I played while they were watching me. I was so pumped up I beat the game while they were encouraging me. This still is a vivid memory for me and I keep that dear to my heart.\n\nSO.... \n\nWhen I found a game on Steam that wanted to emulate the same feel of DP (at the point of being a carbon copy of that concept) I was immediately interested, so I waited for a price drop not being sure if this game could have been a spiritual successor or a failure. Well, it's not a failure as a game, but as a successor to Don't Pull surely is. \n\nBELIEVE ME, SEARCH FOR THREE WONDERS, PLAY IT IN SOME WAY, and you'll see what I mean.\n\nPush and Pully lacks everything that made Don't Pull great: good control movements, fast gameplay, interesting design of levels, interesting enemies and patterns, collectibles, secrets, humor.\n\nMoving is frustrating, the player is slow, and the time the character moves from a square to another, your hitbox still remains in the starting square, and this is a beginner's error that I also made on my first game as designer.\n\nEnemies are boring, some of them have unfair movements and infuriating moves, like the ones that jump on casual points of the already small and full of obstacles maps. Or the ones that fires fast and hard to see projectiles. Add to this that the character has the most slow walk and weird hitbox... very frustrating! Not hard, just frustrating.\n\nSometimes you will feel that enemies and blocks were placed on the maps casually in number and placement, and this shows when you die many times in the first seconds of the latter levels. I really miss planning strategies and trying to speedrun Don't Pull. The flow of that game is just... superior!\n\nAlso, bosses... not much to say for every one of them but the last one: while they are a cute addition and a way to break the monotony, they are extremely easy and monotonous. The last one instead is the worst final boss I've seen in years. He will occupy a large part of the screen, while firing projectile with questionable hitboxes and, on the second phase, it will split in three. Imagine doing all of this on a timer! You'll die because there weren't alternative, a lot. I like hard games, but not unfair. I don't want to beat the game now.\n\nBlocks mechanic is interesting but nothing special, you can just end the level by pushing blocks at random at enemies ignoring combination of bloks. The star rating is not clear, I think using the blocks combination is important for the score; however, I lost interest in wasting time to get 3 star on levels by using clever combinations. Also, maybe it's me, but didn't work majority of time to get me 3 stars. \n\n\nPros:\n+Pixel art and animations are cute and colorful\n+Nice enemies variety\n+Bosses\n+\"Puzzle only\" levels are an interesting addition\n+Cute story\n\nCons:\n-Clunky and slow controls\n-Confusionary or absent level design\n-Infuriating enemies \n-Last boss is the worse last boss I played in years.\n\nReview based on single player mode, but after all I enjoyed play Don't Pull alone majority of time. How could a game from 1991 be better than a one from this year???","timestamp_created":1604109302,"timestamp_updated":1604109720,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnPuYvvUCcriZqwI="}
