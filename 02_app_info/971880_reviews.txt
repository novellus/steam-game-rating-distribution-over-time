The other 30% is a strange and extremely frustrating variation on solitaire where you must match cards (both number and suite) in a Mahjong inspired mode.  This Mahjong mode doesn't seem to play correctly and is a bit of a head scratcher.  I am not even sure if it is possible to solve those puzzles the entire way ?  Maybe I missed something ?  The only saving grace for these levels is that you can skip over them quickly by running through all of the cards in the deck twice. The story and graphics are acceptable and make this game just barely recommended.  There are other much better solitaire games out there.","timestamp_created":1583787088,"timestamp_updated":1583787088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiKPE4PACffWO9wE="}
