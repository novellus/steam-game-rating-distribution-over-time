It's a very average game that can be completed in under an hour easily and doesn't really provide much else.","timestamp_created":1596097547,"timestamp_updated":1596097547,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r/m0z/MCdL6ymAI="}
