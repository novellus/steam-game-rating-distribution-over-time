    review: "...Alright.\n\nNekoCharm follows the story of a girl with the name/nickname\
      \ El. She finally got accepted into Police Academy as she proves herself and\
      \ might get more than she bargained for. How will El do at this new academy?\
      \ What situations will she get into? You can find out if you play this game.\
      \ \n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n1. The character art isn't the best, but the devs\
      \ put in the extra work to make them move. \n2. The music throughout the game\
      \ is nice. However, I feel like I heard some of it in another game, but it might\
      \ just be stock background music. \n3. The CGs, while basic as most are just\
      \ a character model on a background, are nice. Even though there are mostly\
      \ used as eyecandy for the players...\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n1. The little minigame\
      \ can get tough at times but sometimes it is buggy and unfair. Why does it feel\
      \ buggy? First of all, the bubbles can fall off when you shoot sometimes. Secondly,\
      \ it is possible to shoot between two bubbles. The way it is unfair is when\
      \ it gives you four bubbles of the same color in a row. And guess what? That\
      \ color can't be reached because it is blocked by bubbles of another color.\
      \ Overall, the minigame could've used more playtesting.\n2. I know it is just\
      \ a minigame, but what does saving kittens in bubbles have to do with police\
      \ work? Is that what the academy does? I doubt it considering how silly the\
      \ fanservice is in this game. \n3. The story is quick and unnecessary. Some\
      \ scenes are less than 5 sentences long, and are only there to show nudity.\
      \ Characters randomly show up with no introduction, and before you ask questions,\
      \ BAM! Another minigame level. And the cherry on top? [spoiler]CLIFFHANGER ENDING![/spoiler]\
      \ Other games with a story and a minigame added into it gives more time for\
      \ the characters. This game doesn't and just rush you to the minigame so you\
      \ can hopefully pass the level and see more nudity. There is no way I can be\
      \ invested in the story if almost every scene has less than 4 sentences. And\
      \ the fanservice doesn't make going through this game again worth it from the\
      \ frustrations the minigame gave me at times.\n4. There is NO description as\
      \ to what the abilities do. That would've been helpful.\n\n[h1]Nitpick[/h1]\n\
      There might be a couple of spelling errors in this game. One that I found was\
      \ they spelled \"proximity\" like \"priximity\".\n\n[h1]Overall Thoughts[/h1]\n\
      IF you want to play a bubble shooter with fanservice that is a pretty short\
      \ game, then try it out. Additionally, if you want to throw $3 at something,\
      \ then buy this. Otherwise, I don't recommend this. The story is rushed and\
      \ doesn't go deeper into things, and the minigame can be troubling and buggy\
      \ at times. While the animated characters are a nice touch, that alone isn't\
      \ enough to save this game."
