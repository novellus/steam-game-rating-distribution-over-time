But this game is frustrating. The maze concept is awesome but buggy. The camera views cause a lot of frustration, and the fact I can't do anything while the round is in motion feels counter-intuitive. This idea but better execution would be fun. Right now it's just disappointing and frustrating.","timestamp_created":1564487091,"timestamp_updated":1564487091,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s9CsoewCfa+0zwE="}
