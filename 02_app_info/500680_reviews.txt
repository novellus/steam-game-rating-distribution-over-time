The controls are simple, graphics reasonable and the presentation is fairly bare bones,   But so far I am enjoying it though I m not sure whether it will have much long term appeal, there is a level system where you get experience for finishing in the position the owner expected or better (and losing it if you don't meet expectations).  But you don't really get anything for levelling up  other than a better rating.\n\nThere is no management side to this game , you don't breed, buy/sell or train horses - it is purely an arcade game about riding which is exactly what I wanted.","timestamp_created":1605733597,"timestamp_updated":1605733678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu+/L7vUCfpKYrwI="}
