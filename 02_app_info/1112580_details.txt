Did you think you'd see a crew as a number? Did you think you'd gorge without fear of judgements? But, sir, you're not in the Royal Navy. The pirate's life is a life of dreams. And it's precisely because we have a shitty life that we have dreams.","supported_languages":"English, French","reviews":"“Well, this game was weird. And possibly quite brilliant, too. I’ve never played anything like it, to be honest. It’s at once an obsessively complex deep dive into maritime history, but set in a strange fantasy world, and a weirdo RPG about being a pirate. There’s worker placement activities. There’s dialogue segments. There are resource management elements. Ship-to-ship combat involves a (fucking astonishing) typing game, and then a sort of side scrolling beat ’em up bit? A huge element of the game revolves around managing your relationship with the ship’s captain, and choosing how often to contradict their orders. There’s eerie, awful, brilliant music. It occasionally reminded me of Dwarf Fortress. What I’m saying is, there’s no way of summarising A Pirate Quartermaster in a couple of paragraphs. It was like a game made in a parallel universe with entirely different ideas about what a game should be like, and I’ve rarely encountered something with such a hit rate of entirely original mechanics. The demo only let me dip a toe into this odd and salt-stained world, so it’s hard to say whether the full game is likely to be entirely engrossing, or a barely-playable mess. Either way though, and I don’t say this lightly, it’s some kind of masterpiece. Don’t let this ship pass you in the night.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rockpapershotgun.com\/2020\/06\/19\/the-best-steam-festival-demos-management-games\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"
