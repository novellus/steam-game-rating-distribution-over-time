The only thing fun is the arena, and that's only for the materials.  Combat is VERY clunky.  You move slow, and I mean SLOW.  The crafting system isn't horrible.  All in all, the game is boring and has very little to offer from what I've found.  Even before it was abandoned.  Do yourself a favor and find something else, this isn't worth it even on sale.","timestamp_created":1599864832,"timestamp_updated":1599864832,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIDYv/QCfoOdoQI="}
