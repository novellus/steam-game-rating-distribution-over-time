I was fooled by the screen shots and video of game play. The game looks good  but when played it is  a  HUGE ! disapointment.","timestamp_created":1582227260,"timestamp_updated":1582227260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1585846577,"developer_response":"Hallo rickgodsey, thank you for the feedback. We are re-working all the stages and adding a few more to better guide players and to clarify the systems behind the game.\n\nOur latest update we re-worked the animation system. I believe the 3d immersion is better now.  Please do not hesitate to make any suggestions as I want to improve player experience."}],"cursor":"AoJwpoCGsvACecbE8wE="}
