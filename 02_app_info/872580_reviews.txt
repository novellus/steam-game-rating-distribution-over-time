Great for practicing precise movement and timing. Levels are difficult, but not unreasonable. This game has taken inspiration from Super Meat Boy, which I love! Since this game has a pretty small community so far, I challenge everyone to beat my times! A few interface changes would be nice, like a 'return to level select' option from the level pause. Check it out!","timestamp_created":1584388665,"timestamp_updated":1584388665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46o278vACeO/L+AE="}
