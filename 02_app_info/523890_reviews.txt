I wasn't having fun and the game just didn't look good in VR. The 3D graphics just didn't pop. Plus, on top of that the motion controllers are used like laser pointers where you press trigger as a one button controller. Finally, there wasn't a tutorial or explanation for anything that you were doing.\n\nI switched to an Xbox One controller. It was a combination of gaze-based navigation and one button controls. It felt very odd at first, but seemed more seamless than the motion controllers. I started going further into the levels and I was starting to have some fun. The further I went, the trickier the levels got. New elements are introduced which change up what you've been doing and the goal isn't always the same in every level. \n\nI would get stuck on a level until I figured out some of the mechanics. This game does a great job of making the difficulty so it seems like something you should be able to get done with just a few tries. It just takes a bit of practice. Perfect for that just one more try gameplay archetype. I don't know exactly how to explain this game. You basically guide this pod around and try to collect some stuff and break some other stuff and also avoid some stuff in the least amount of time.\n\nThere are some pinball mechanics thrown in. I'm not sure I would use the word breakout or Arkanoid to describe this game, but you do break some stuff. There are many levels. I think there are close to 50 if I'm not mistaken (several levels unlock once you beat the earlier levels). \n\nAnyways, this is a simple arcade game that's easy enough to get into, yet can also be very difficult and challenging ... especially if you want to get the top score. Not many games use gaze-based navigation in an innovative way or fun way, but this game seems to have nailed that part down. \n\nMy main criticisms is the lack of a tutorial or even explanation of the game mechanics (although they are easy enough to learn after some trial and error). Also, the visuals just don't really pop in VR. I hope this game gets a better 3D artist to remaster these levels. I think this game could be as beautiful as it plays. For right now, it is fun to play but it's definitely not eye candy at all.\n\n[b]Rating ?/10. I'm not giving a final score because I haven't beaten the game, but I do recommend it. Also, don't get discouraged by the start. It does get much better after the first few levels! I got this on sale today for $4.49 USD and think it's a great deal at that price.[/b]","timestamp_created":1581122927,"timestamp_updated":1581128144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617739558219909668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyJqlkfACcbHp8AE="}
