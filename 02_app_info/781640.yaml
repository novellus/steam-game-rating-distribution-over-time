    about_the_game: Run Jump Fail puts you in control of the hapless HappyMan, and
      tasks you with guiding him through a whole load of treacherous obstacle courses.
      You'll fail a lot along the way, but watching HappyMan collapse and flail when
      he's just run into a wall, or tripped on a ledge, or been hit by a big red spinning
      thing is a lot of fun.<br><br>Seriously, failing is 90% of the fun. So fail
      away.<br><br>The game is a 3D platformer that's dead simple to pick up and play
      in short bursts, so if you need a break from grinding away at the latest 50
      hour epic RPG and fancy a spot of fun filled action, look no further.<br><br>Obligatory
      feature list:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Unique physics based 3D platforming
      action.</li><li>Ragdolls!</li><li>50+ obstacle courses, and more on the way.</li><li>Minigames.</li><li>Sandbox

    short_description: You wanna run? You wanna jump? You're gonna fail. Again. And
      Again. But its fun to fail...right? Take control of HappyMan and hop skip and
      jump your way past low walls, big balls and spinning red things! A bunch of
      obstacles await, so get to it.

    review: Damn this game is so fun, the physics and obstacle courses are really
      creative like watching HappyMan flop around is so funny and then finally succeeding
      is so satisfying. My only suggestion is to make a level maker and have other
      players play ur level and u can play others levels (yes i know it might be hard
      but it will all pay off in the end)
