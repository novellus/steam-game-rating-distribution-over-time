It's less than 5 dollars, and it honestly shouldn't cost even that much. It is nothing but a glitchy ripoff of Monopoly. It didn't even bother improving or significantly altering the concept from Monopoly.","timestamp_created":1530143771,"timestamp_updated":1530143771,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444077461957931519","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1530372363,"developer_response":"Thank you for your review, even if it came after 5 (0.1 hours according to Steam) minutes of play. The game is actually quite a bit different in 4 ways from Monopoly.\n\n- You have a random job with a title and differing pay scales that have you have to deal with during the game that you can alter with your decisions. It isn't always just $200 when you pass GO.\n- The board is randomly generated every game, AND every turn around on the non-street spaces.\n- The Fortune Point system allows you to create your own strategy with cashing them in for benefits.\n- The Big Event cards have little life episodes in them to add character and depth beyond just a 'upgrade streets + toll' mechanic.\n\nThese are all things that significantly change the way the game is played from bare-bones Monopoly, for certain."}],"cursor":"AoJ4l6HroeQCeO27pAE="}
