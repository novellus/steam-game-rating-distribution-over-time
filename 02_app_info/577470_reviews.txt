Its as if am clicking on an empty space instead of a interface button. This becomes a problem when moving my characters during combat where my magic users just keep on charging headlong into a group of giant orcs as i click on another part of map for them to move but due to unresponsive controls they end up marching to their death.\n\nSimilar issues happen when leveling up characters or selecting items in the inventory where i have to click multiple times where i usually never am able to get the game to do the selected action.\n\nTo be asking for $19.99 plus tax for such a shoddy product is pretty lame. Sadly the game is just not worth the hassle.","timestamp_created":1601675669,"timestamp_updated":1601675669,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44OXT9fQCeNi9pQI="}
