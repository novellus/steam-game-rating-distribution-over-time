    review: There really isn't a game here.  That says it all, but I'll cover the
      bases.  Keyboard/mouse controls work, but the gamepad does not (although a gamepad
      control option is available).  The game ran smoothly, but the visuals are boring
      and pretty much limited to what you see in the screenshots...I haven't gotten
      past the first mission so I'm only assuming.  The Sky Hawk itself is loaded
      with missiles and guns, neither of which can be accurately aimed due to a lack  of
      any sort of targeting reticle/system.  Fuel, ammo and armor can be replinished
      from the supply points scattered around the map, but I have yet to find a way
      to actually pick them up or shoot them to activate.  So you eventually run out
      of either fuel, armor or ammo and the mission fails.  Luckily I purchased this
      on sale, so I'm not out a great deal of money, but I actually wouldn't recommend
      this "game" at any price unless it somehow gets finished.   If it does get fixed
      I'll update my review.
