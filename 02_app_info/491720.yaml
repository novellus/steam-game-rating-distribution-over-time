    review: 'This is a brain buster of a game. Having to jump over the terrain is
      easy, at least it would be if that''s the only thing you had to do. You also
      must press the correct arrow keys to kill enemies. I struggled at first to make
      my do both. Like when you first wake up in the morning and can''t talk and make
      your breakfast at the same time. However, the concept of the game is awesome!
      It''s so much fun once you feel yourself doing both. It''s like you mastered
      some weird skill you''ll never need ever again.


      For a budget game, Nary is great and perfect for a few hours of fun. It''s not
      going to take very long to complete all the levels. Especially if you find a
      couple items to help you out. There''s a strange system where you use a currency
      that can spin a random shop wheel. The strange part is how you get the currency
      because I couldn''t even begin to tell you. Not all the items are in the shop
      either. They become unlocked somehow? There''s a lot of mystery around this
      part of the game and it doesn''t matter. It isn''t the focus of Nary.


      While the gameplay is good the menus are cumbersome. I chose an item that only
      gave me two lives so I had to keep going back to the menu to try again. Which
      doesn''t matter since the game starts you at the beginning of the level anyway?
      I can''t see any reason for the game to give lives out at all. So it''s a hassle
      to go back to the main menu to try again. I can see reaching a point where I''m
      too tired of all the menus to continue playing.


      Also, I think the icons on the enemies could be a little bigger.


      Overall, Nary is good for a budget game. A little rough in some of the menus/music
      areas and the gameplay could use some refinement. Still, if you want a challenge
      for your mind to fingers abilities then this is for you. I want to see Nary
      2 with bigger ideas, more user testing, and better menus.
