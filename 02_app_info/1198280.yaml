      The Angel Inn Guide and Artbook

      Developer: Dungeon Dreams Games (DDreamsGames)

      Publisher: Dungeon Dreams Games (DDreamsGames)


      [b]Pros:[/b]

      1. Includes a basic guide. Enough to get your through a few of the routes.

      2. Includes the artwork from the game in high quality

      3. Features notes of the characters, from the developers and the artist; Azukichan.


      [b]Cons:[/b]

      1. The guide is basic so you may need to search up online to find a more detailed
      one for the harder to access routes.


      [b]Conclusion:[/b]

      A small DLC for The Angel Inn which includes a simple guide and the artwork
      from game along with WIPs for some of them when they were in the making. The
      guide is quite basic so you may have to search on the internet for a more detailed
      one, but this DLC does its job in including a guide and the entire digital artbook.
      It also features some notes from the developers and the artist; Azukichan.
