The story presented is quite long, consistent, well-paced, and no character is left aside. In this game, Yuuji is not in the limelight until the last third, which leaves room for the girls to show they have talents of their own. The backgrounds, dialogues and music are of the same great quality as the other two games. In my opinion, the ending was fine as it really brings closure to the whole arc while still leaving things open-ended.\n\n[b][-][/b]⠀There are only two things that bothered me a bit: the two incongruous CGI movies that felt out of place and the fact that some of the girls pull off ridiculous supermoves out of nowhere, just to give the story an action-oriented edge.","timestamp_created":1609318789,"timestamp_updated":1609318789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554183840751647949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+P232fYCdYvcvgI="}
