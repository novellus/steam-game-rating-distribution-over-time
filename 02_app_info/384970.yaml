    about_the_game: "You are an embedded journalist travelling with a small US Army\
      \ special forces team as they battle &quot;The Soldiers of Heaven&quot; - a\
      \ religious cult in Iraq that tried to start a Muslim Armageddon during the\
      \ Ashura festival. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis battle with the SOH ended with over\
      \ 300 deaths : men, women and children. This project is based on a true story\
      \ that was covered up... and now you have a chance to try and find the truth.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmed with a virtual camera you will film your own version\
      \ of the story as it unfolds in an immersive 3D world. In this build you can\
      \ watch a preview in game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis immersive journalism experience\
      \ combines live action with 3D animation. It is being built with the Unreal\
      \ 4 game engine. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes this experience unique, useful\
      \ or innovative: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtual reality offers film makers an opportunity\
      \ to step into their story world and get a 360 degree real time perspective\
      \ of the world they are trying to bring to life. This is ideal for previsualization\
      \ and production planning as the film maker can leverage the presence that VR\
      \ offers and look for new shots and camera angles as they walk around their\
      \ virtual set. What is missing is a virtual camera that the film maker can use\
      \ to shoot. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also think that filming in VR could be a\
      \ new way to create animated films. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFilmtyme is powered\
      \ by the Canadian Film Centers Media Lab &quot;Ideaboost&quot; program"
