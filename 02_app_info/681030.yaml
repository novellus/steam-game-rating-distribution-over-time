    review: "This game was released yesterday as  Beta. Fair enough, but there isn't\
      \ anything currently on the website to indicate that is the case. I guess there's\
      \ a news article third down.\n\nEven if that's so, the gameplay videos and screenshots\
      \ do not match in game at all.\n-I have no 'Captain' ship. There are no 'turns'.\
      \ You have control over the buildings but nothing you build to defend your colony\
      \ do anything but move from one building to another, never to be seen again.\
      \ I played for a half hour to see if like...maybe I didn't know what I was doing?\
      \ I'm not dumb. Other than clicking buildings and pressing buttons (that cut\
      \ off numbers and words in the tooltips), you can control placement. There's\
      \ no menus like in the video. You launch, choose a ship you never see, and then\
      \ you can place five buildings and upgrade them and watch them be destroyed\
      \ without being able to do anything about it. \n\nI mean I'm happy to be wrong\
      \ but...there probably should be some kind of 'Early Access' or shots that match\
      \ the current state of the game. The only thing it MIGHT be is a rogue-like...but\
      \ not one you're going to feel good about because it's about as inevitable as\
      \ an hourglass.\n\nI hope the Dev continues to work on it. Could be an amusing\
      \ sidebar. Now it's pong with highlightable objects."
