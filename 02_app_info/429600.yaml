    about_the_game: When evil Puppeteer kidnaps souls of innocent children, you're
      assigned your first mission as Brothers Grimm's investigator - find a way to
      defeat the malefactor and bring rescue to all in need. Follow the trace of magical
      events to discover sorcerer's blind spot. Use it to defeat him and bring home
      all who have been lost!<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a man who went from
      town to town with songs and poetry, capturing the souls of children. From generation
      to generation, the tale was told. But every fairy tale has its true bitter beginning.
      Now a new evil has visited the town of Arbourshire, and children have been going
      missing. A mysterious puppet theatre seems to be at the centre of their disappearance.
      The town is in an uproar! A mob roams the streets and the Brothers Grimm have
      assigned to you the task of discovering the truth behind the Fairy Tale Mystery!
