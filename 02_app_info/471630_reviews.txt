No, you don't have to pack your sleeping bag and mosquito spray, this is bringing the camp to you!\n\nDinosaurs in space with giant guns and swords vs generic black goo alien energy thing. Hosted by what appears to be a slightly taller Vanellope von Schweetz. The dialog is... campy, the jokes are... also campy. The entire premise is campy, but if you're okay with camp, it's actually pretty solid. The VR is used in a way that really emphasize the scale of the characters and how that sense of presence comes across to the normal sized person that you are.\n\nAll said, it seems to mostly just be an advertisement for a comic book series, which looks even campier from the previews they offer, and it seems to just be a passive experience, despite pretending otherwise, but everything is polished well enough to be worth at least checking out to see what they do.","timestamp_created":1486441279,"timestamp_updated":1486441279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44b2zi9oCfdbAcQ=="}
