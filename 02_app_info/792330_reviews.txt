But every character that voiced them from the first game, is different(At least in English). That changed my entire mood to this DLC. I went from excited to skipping ALL the dialogue of squad 7. I don't know if they had a short time in getting voice actors for the game and just had to make do with what they had, or they didnt care because it was a DLC but it ruined my entire mood to this DLC. They also join Squad E for some reason? Why? Makes no since to the story or continuity. I know this review is just a rant but it threw my entire mood for the love on how the old VA fit their characters so well and having these other VA totally not get the feel of their character for a short DLC, out the window.","timestamp_created":1606866819,"timestamp_updated":1606866819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+7qukPYCdsrQtgI="}
