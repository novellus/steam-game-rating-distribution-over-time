It has 6 levels to go through, which turns into a 2nd loop of a hard mode after you beat them, and then a true last boss battle at the end. This game is good for what it is, and the only bad thing I have to say about it really is that the music is quite awful. Other than that, it's enjoyable and worth playing.","timestamp_created":1566015656,"timestamp_updated":1566015656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513975560665130615","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhNLzzuwCdp3A0AE="}
