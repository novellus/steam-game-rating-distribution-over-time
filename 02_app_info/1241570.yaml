      \ a new buggy paint job (Veteran\u2019s Ride) and blueprints for three new weapons.\
      \ Whatever horrors Harran throws at you, you\u2019ll be ready with your trusty\
      \ Hellbeast. This fully homemade (no firearm needed to craft it!) double-barreled\
      \ shotgun packs a hellish punch and its extreme fire rate makes it an ideal\
      \ crowd control tool. Your First is a return to the roots, but unlike the random\
      \ gas pipe you clenched at the beginning, this one grants you a damage boost\
      \ after three consecutive hits. And if you need to hit even harder, you can\u2019\
