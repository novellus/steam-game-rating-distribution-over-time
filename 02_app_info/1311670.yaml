    about_the_game: The Forsaken Ruins is a first-person horror game. Interact with
      the environment around you by picking up objects and throwing them to overcome
      challenging obstacles and monsters. Beginning in a cell, you play as <strong>The
      Prisoner</strong> and your main goal is to escape the ruins alive. Blow up cell
      doors and smash items, whilst attempting to remain hidden from unknown threats.
      <br><br>Delve deep into hell and you might just find a way out.<br><br><strong><u>DELVE</u></strong><br>Solve
      puzzles by reading books and notes throughout the ruins. Explore five unique
      levels, each with their own level of dread.<br><br><strong><u>SURVIVE</u></strong><br>Stay
      hidden or run away from monsters that lurk in the darkness.<br><br><strong><u>ESCAPE</u></strong><br>Throw
      flaming barrels to overcome challenging obstacles and blow up prison doors to
      gain access to new areas! You'll need to find four keys by smashing chests,
      before you even think about trying to escape!<br><br><i>NOTE:</i> The Forsaken
      Ruins is currently being developed as a university project, and so, will release
      as an Early Access title. I intend to keep working on the game even after university
      finishes upon release. As it stands, I have plans to refine the game-play and
      add more content in the future!

    review: "Gosh! Jack, I hate you!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of scary games because\
      \ ehm.. They scare me. However, I somehow ended up with this game on my wishlist\
      \ and not long after an email notification that this is finally out on Early\
      \ Access I have decided to buy it and give it a go. So what do I think?\n\n\
      It's great! No, it really is. Don't expect fireworks and over the top game mechanics\
      \ with super fancy graphics. This game is very simple to get into and straight\
      \ away feel the atmosphere of it. Maybe one tip for the developers.. When all\
      \ of the torches are switched off perhaps make it a 'tiny' bit more darker?\
      \ It's still easy to see even with your own torch off. Would definitely add\
      \ to the whole atmosphere a bit more.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I needed to go\
      \ for a shower after playing this game because I was legit scared. I hope everyone\
      \ else finds it the same. \n\nAnd that little note towards the end.. You bastards!\
      \ Hopefully whatever I recorded is good enough and I will share my own view\
      \ on this on the big red platform.\n\nBuy it! It's cheap! It's not fully polished\
      \ but it's definitely good enough to play already and enjoy!"
