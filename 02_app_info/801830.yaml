    review: '(Note:  Duplicate banner to the original game.  This is the DLC to [i]Annotation
      of Love[/i].)


      [h1]You''ll be getting this if you want to 100% this game![/h1]


      Yep, this enables the missing achievement for this game.  Support the developers
      with this DLC to their free game if you loved their base game.


      It promises text, audio (to download), and video gameplay of the developers
      playing the game... yeah, I know it sounds disappointing and like something
      that you could expect from your own gameplay.  So, what''s the reason to get
      this DLC?Aside from what I just mentioned, it''s to support the developer (if
      you enjoyed the game) and to unlock an achievement.


      That said, do I recommend it?  Outside of supporting the developer and unlocking
      1 achievement, I wouldn''t recommend it.   So...why did I do it?  I thought
      the developer did a decent job with the music and the lack of completion was
      bugging me.  Whether you get this DLC or not is entirely up to you, but I''d
      advise against it.


      1/10  Basic dev support DLC.  (Leniency for a decent job on the base game)'
