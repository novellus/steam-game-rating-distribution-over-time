    review: "Ok first things first, For the regular price of $11.99, NO I cannot recommend\
      \ this game, for the on sale price of $2.99, I can BARELY recommend this game.\n\
      \nThe keyboard controls are finally fixed (thanks dev) but the controller settings\
      \ are TERRIBLE, I'll be uploading a video breakdown of the  control problems.\
      \ I was pretty harsh on this game in my review, it was fun, but it's broken\
      \ AND it needs a lot of work. Lower the price to 1.99 and I can recommend the\
      \ game for what it is currently. If you EVER want to get $11.99 you'll have\
      \ to do a lot of work.\n\nFix the menus and ensure they work properly, Change\
      \ the crazy red and blue light color scheme, it's headache inducing, it makes\
      \ the game more difficult AND it doesn't look good.\n\nThe AI needs it's pathing\
      \ updated, they should actively avoid obstacles, such as chairs and tables,\
      \ when making their way to the player, They also need the same kind of accuracy\
      \ as the player, They literally don't miss unless you're moving AND they shoot\
      \ through tiny door openings or walls constantly.\n\nWhen you're standing over\
      \ a weapon to pickup, have something above the player showing which will be\
      \ picked up, WHY can't I change my 4th weapon... WHY does the weapon get thrown\
      \ when I'm trying to pick another one up? \n\nThe controller, Unity has built\
      \ in gamepad support, utilize it, There are TONS of tutorial videos on how this\
      \ works. You won't have to do ANYTHING aside from plug it into your char_controller.cs\
      \ (or however you have it named)\n\nDifficult is one thing, this game is beyond\
      \ that.\n\nPlease devs keep working on it, you've got a great base, this game\
      \ can definitely be awesome. Please don't take this as an attack, I'd like to\
      \ think it's more constructive criticism.\n\ncheckout my review on youtube\n\
