But it did not engage me at all.\n The premises of the game are good - you can use gravity, and control time, and it does look pretty cool. 20 minutes into the game and I regret buying it - and double regret buying it 6 months ago and not being able to return it.\n The controls feel extremely clunky. Trying to run and suddenly roll is not really confortable in the hand. Having to examine the crates where the items are to just look at them and click them seems a waste of time, just grabbing them would be easier. Deaths don't have great animations, when I fell through a set of lasers no change was seen in the character. The rope mechanics are OK but add to that sense of clunkiness the game gives in overal.\n There is no control support (I tried with both a PS4 and an 360 control) which would be good but not perfect - as there is the option to shoot down enemy bullets with your own bullets while you are on bullet time, and an analog stick might not be the best to do this.\n Maybe in some time I would give this another try and change my mind, but I encourage people to try it for themselves first.","timestamp_created":1523660493,"timestamp_updated":1523660590,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547913432121276855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu/HP4OICfYqZngE="}
