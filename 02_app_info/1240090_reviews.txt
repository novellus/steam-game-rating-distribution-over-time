It's hard to pick up the kana when you're getting beat up.  I'm on level 3 and there are these boxer type guys that are WAY too hard.  I'm constantly getting bounced between mobs and dying.  It's also unfair that the mobs seem to have a further attack range than me.  I have to be right up on them while they can be like 5ft away.  Very often we will attack at the same time and I get hit but they don't.\n\nI don't see myself getting past level 3 unfortunately.","timestamp_created":1601093760,"timestamp_updated":1601093760,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwP6n5PQCdaGOpAI="}
