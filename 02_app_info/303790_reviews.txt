Control a faery creature and solve various mysteries and challenges in this somewhat unfinished adventure game.\n\nThis is one of those rare games where a \"maybe\" option would really help.   Technical implementation here is good, with a few graphics tweaks, smooth gameplay in 4K on most systems.   There's a few known bugs that stop the game working on some systems, however.   The game does seem a little incomplete as well.   Finally, I'm not really going to recommend a game about fairies to anyone I know.","timestamp_created":1609855724,"timestamp_updated":1609855724,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnp246fYCdtrawAI="}
