Launching it for the first time, I was shocked by how visually appealing and creative every small detail was. I expected that the loss of progress would be common and frustrating and I was right. But that's what makes games like this one so much fun. Not only that, but the style and unique map design each level has makes all the pain and torment worth it to see what stunning display awaits for you beyond. I definitely recommend this title to fans of this style of game and newcomers alike.","timestamp_created":1603643281,"timestamp_updated":1603643281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45tGlsPUCfI2KqgI="}
