I bought it to play with some friends via Remote Play and we think the fighters and stages are very well designed and varied, welcoming all types of players. If you’re looking for a 4 players brawler, then this is probably one of the best you will be able to find on Steam. However, as I said, only buy it if you don’t plan to play with more than 4 players, the trailer says “up to 8 players”, but this is not true. The game doesn’t support more than 4 controllers at all, there’s a bunch of people with the same issue as we in the community tab, and according to the developer, he never had the chance to test the game with 8 players, so he just assumed it worked. I really hope he’s able to fix it or at least update his promotional material.","timestamp_created":1609812585,"timestamp_updated":1609812585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4otWT6PYCecrJwAI="}
