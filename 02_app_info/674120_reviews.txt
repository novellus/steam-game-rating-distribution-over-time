Sadly, it is a real disappointment. Actually, that might be too gentle an assessment. The game is entirely unresponsive and, despite the graphics being simple and low quality, it lags and drags like a high-end game being run on Win 97. Simple graphics are fine, if the game actually works (I would usually acknowledge that this may be my machine, but I am running a brand new high-end graphics card and processor, so I rather doubt it on this occasion). The audio seems really cool, but that is the only positive I have been able to find.\n\n First of all, the lack of language choice for the subtitles (which provide your only instructions), make the game inaccessible to anyone who cannot read Italian. Then this is compounded by totally unresponsive controls as you try to navigate your way out of the first room. THE FIRST ROOM! And heaven forbid you, should you figure out what you have to do, that you should make a mistake (such a dropping a cup on the floor instead of in the sink, if you can even get your charcter to pick it up at all), because you won't be able to pick it up again, let alone progress out of the room.\n\nI never did make it out of this room and it's a real shame because I really do try to support indie horrors as much as I can. I regret taking a chance on this in early access. Instead of spending time playing a new game, I spent over an hour just trying to get the thing to work. \n\n This game is NOT ready to expect people to pay for it. Hold it back and get it playable before you ask people to part with their cash. \n\nI really hope the developers get this game together soon because the idea is a really intriguing one.\n\n","timestamp_created":1508440599,"timestamp_updated":1508440599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593405485153198242","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1509104159,"developer_response":"Hi MamaA!
