If you have seen one of his works you will recognise it immediately. The NOX short is not MIND GAME but it is still amazing nonetheless. \nI highly recommend the original French audio. Not only because it is superb, but also because the English one cut away Sound Effects and reverb for no reason(?)\n\nIt adds a lot to Nox' origins and I enjoyed it a lot.
