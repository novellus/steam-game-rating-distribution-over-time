It is really brilliant idea and it has great potential, but too monotone and boring in terms of game juice.\n\nIt seems it has nice graphics, but somehow with killing poor performance. I think It has a deep optimization problem for such a small game that my cpu heat burst with not only low fps, but shaking vision and stammering voice time to time.\n\nI hope the developers update and progress what they've started, but for now, It is very very poor.","timestamp_created":1554443959,"timestamp_updated":1554443959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52645498514175415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rY+F9ukCfdrLvgE="}
