If you hate Fire Emblem, you will probably hate this.\n\nThe design decisions that are likely to be controversial are\n* permadeath\n* durability\n* grinding is (almost) impossible\n* simplistic leveling\n\nFire Emblem makes most of the same controversial design decisions.\n\nYou can turn off permadeath by selecting \"Casual Mode\" when starting the game, just like in recent Fire Emblem games.  This acknowledges that nobody actually plays Fire Emblem with permadeath.  The games are too long for such setbacks to be acceptable, so you always retry the battle until all your characters survive.  Choosing \"Casual Mode\" (thankfully) does not make the combat easier.\n\nYou (unfortunately) cannot turn off durability.  There is nothing so anticlimactic as having your equipment fail mid-battle so that the character equipped with it is useless.  Finite money with limited access to vendors makes this worse.\n\nThe number of battles are finite, just like in Fire Emblem.  I enjoy not being required to grind.  People who like fighting easy battles over and over so that they can win battles that were intentionally imbalanced to pad play time may object (these people exist).\n\nThe simplistic leveling cannot be excused by the Fire Emblem ancestry.  Fire Emblem allows characters to be customized.  This should probably be improved, but you can command a large number of characters at once and there are a large number of classes, which helps to reduce the perception that characters are generic.\n\nSome people are complaining about the graphics.  The portraits are static, but that is not unusual.  Appearances are reused, but that is not unusual.  Most of it looks like typical western animation style.  The graphics will impress no one but are not offensive to me.\n\nSome people are complaining about the user interface.  Movements and attacks are communicated with colored tiles and icons, as is typical in turn-based tactical role-playing games.  Most icon choices are reasonable, and they all have helpful tooltips.  I am not seeing the problem, or even the difference from the norm, here.\n\nI agree with the reviews that mention the music is good.  The style is what you would expect in a fantasy setting, but it is well above average.\n\nWhat I have seen of the plot is average to above average.  Daughters on a quest to rescue their father is a pleasant diversion from all the teenage boys on quests to rescue women.\n\nThe text is far too small in the user interface and conversation dialogs, and it is not possible to adjust.  This is likely to be an accessibility problem for almost everyone middle aged or older and a significant portion of youth.\n\nThat you cannot save at will is a legitimate complaint.\n\nCombat that is won via reasoning ability instead of who ambushes who first, stat bloat, build hard counters, or luck is a very nice thing to see in a genre that is often dumbed-down in those ways.  I also love the ability to (de)construct the battlefield and move opponents.\n\nI look forward to the author's engine improvements and future games.\n","timestamp_created":1609691763,"timestamp_updated":1609691763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k+LG5PYCeaKPwAI="}
