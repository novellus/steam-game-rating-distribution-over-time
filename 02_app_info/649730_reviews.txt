The narrative has underlying themes of depression; following dreams vs. financial security; escapism and more.","timestamp_created":1546060933,"timestamp_updated":1546064432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuOGn/OcCdbrktgE="}
