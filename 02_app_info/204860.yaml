    review: 'So I have completed this game and all of the bonus missions as well as
      all others in the Men of War series, so I think I can give a pretty good overall
      summary.


      This game appears to have been rushed. It really lacks the polish of other entries
      in the series (especially the later Assault Squad games but even the original
      Men of War was a vastly better product). There are a number of bugs in almost
      every mission, many of which are not actually very difficult fixes within the
      GEM editor. For instance in some missions the devs have allowed you to control
      soldiers that aren''t actually supposed to be assigned to you, so they are invincible
      and also cannot kill anyone... rather frustrating.


      In terms of the content, the missions are all very much the same. You have to
      clear rows of enemy defences with a small number of troops and then defend against
      a counterattack. If I''m honest the bonus missions were not even really that
      fun compared to other entries in the series. It''s a time sink, but not necessarily
      a good one.


      My genuine recommendation would be to buy either Men of War, Assault Squad 1
      or 2, Vietnam or even Red Tide as they are usually the same sort of price but
      are just much more polished products. It''s a shame really that they didn''t
      release any patches to fix the game because I imagine with a little bit more
      it could''ve been way more enjoyable.'
