    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nYou can view my gameplay\
      \ & initial impressions review here (also where I make this really cool drawing\
      \ at the end by almost sheer luck): https://youtu.be/MvmuQeEZAu4\n\nThis is\
      \ an educational app for VR where you can use block programming to draw 3D creations\
      \ in VR. This is similar to Google Blockly or MIT Scratch if you're familiar\
      \ with those free open-source programs.\n\nObviously, you can just learn block\
      \ programming from Blockly or Scratch for free if you'd like and there's several\
      \ online tutorials for that as well. However, this program lets you see your\
      \ creations in VR so it does add something to the table.\n\nYou can use teleportation\
      \ or full locomotion. You have a tablet that you can easily re-size and have\
      \ it come towards your hands. You have a few environments to choose from as\
      \ well. The program ran smoothly for me and I didn't experience any issues.\n\
      \nMy main criticism of this app is that there really is no tutorial. There is\
      \ just some texts explaining what the different functions do in general. There's\
      \ also some exemplars that you can run within the program and mess with to give\
      \ you an idea of how the different functions work. Also, I would like to see\
      \ more than just drawing. I know that MIT Scratch has sprite animations in their\
      \ block programming as well. That would have been really cool here. \n\nOverall,\
      \ I had fun. I don't know how much time I have to put into this but I definitely\
      \ learned a very simple block program in a very short amount of time. I can\
      \ definitely recommend this to anyone interested in block programming for VR.\
      \ I know the 2D programs are free, but I don't mind spending $9 USD (sale price)\
      \ to see this brought to VR."
