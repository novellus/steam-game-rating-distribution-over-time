What makes this game stand out among other similar titles is, that both electric fields and magnetic fields are present. The Shocktopus is charged positively, so it is repelled by positive electric field, whereas magnetic fields spin the Shocktopus.","timestamp_created":1570275311,"timestamp_updated":1570275311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ffsze0Ce4TH0wE="}
