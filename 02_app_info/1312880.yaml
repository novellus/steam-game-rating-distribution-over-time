    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">ABOUT THIS GAME </h2><br>Midas destroys everything
      he touches, Tintin can craft new platforms and items for Midas to jump off,
      the two of them are in a journey to escape the deepness of the dungeon, by destroying
      and crafting a new world around them. <br><br>Jump, Run, Destroy, and Craft
      in this cute and challenging adventure.<h2 class="bb_tag">THE PLATFORMER</h2>Rompe
      retains the typical elements of a platformer, however, it brings an alternative
      basic element present in some titles and moments of other games in the genre,
      and that is that you basically break everything you touch (how challenging!).
      Starting from that basis, extra care is at the order of each jump and movement,
      and if we add to this the progressive level of difficulty and the inclusion
      of different elements, we have a quite entertaining game, even in this phase
      of development.
