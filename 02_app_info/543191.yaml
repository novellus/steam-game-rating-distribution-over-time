    review: 'This DLC adds some new items to your game world.


      To be a bit more specific, when you buy one of the skin packs you will receive
      a headgear piece of Armour that has a decent defense amount,a new pet that comes
      with unique passives for you an lastly a weapon that has some very decent starting
      damage stats, and in most cases these weapons can be upgraded as well.


      Unless you are only interested in a specific skin pack i''d suggest buying the
      Buy How to Survive 2 - Kovac''s Ultimate Edition to get the best value for money,
      but only when it is on sale, as it stands this game has some terrible bugs.'
