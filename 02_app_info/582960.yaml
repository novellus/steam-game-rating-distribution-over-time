    review: '[h1]Why, oh why, did we get stuck with an iOS port?[/h1]

      Okay, I''m not bashing the game. LIT is an okay puzzler with well-established
      mechanics. Each room gradually ramps up the difficulty to the point when trial-and-error
      is the best way to solve everything. The 8-button control scheme keeps things
      simple, yet is better suited to a controller than a keyboard. Unfortunately,
      that''s all the good I could glean. The background music is loud and the story
      is barebones.


      For those of you unaware, LIT originally debuted as a WiiWare game. I, sadly,
      didn''t get to play it before the Wii store was closed for good, but my old
      Nintendo mags and YouTube have been great aids. Instead of a 2D puzzler with
      a cutesy art style, it was in 3D with a more realistic approach to the visuals.
      And that''s what it has over the iOS version: better visuals and a better horror
      atmosphere. Instead of grey tiles, there were writhing masses of shadow with
      things scuttling about in them that wouldn''t hesitate to drag you in if you
      took one wrong step. The monsters were a lot more unique than the same generic
      sprite, showing what would happen if the shadows consume you like they did the
      staff and other students.


      It also had more intriguing mechanics: a flashlight to illuminate parts of the
      room to see what''s hidden in the shadows. An electricity meter to ensure you
      don''t abuse the TVs and computers, along with motion-sensing cameras which
      punish heavy electricity use. There were boss battles. What''s more, you would
      occasionally get phone calls from Rachael as she struggles to survive as a nice
      atmospheric bonus.


      In short, we''re stuck with the inferior version of the game. If anyone has
      a WiiU, then you may have a chance to (re)download the original. Better that
      then this version, I say.'
