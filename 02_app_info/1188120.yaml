    review: I used this adventure for a group of brand new players and they loved
      it. We didn't do it as a one shot and I made the story about Rick kidnapping
      the players by his portal science and I allowed the special rules that are laid
      out in the guide so players could really let loose like they were watching the
      TV show. This was a great fun house style dungeon that really entertained my
      group of 7 players for 8 weeks.
