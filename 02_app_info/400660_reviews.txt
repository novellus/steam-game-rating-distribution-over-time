It's basic strategy elements have been done before, but the replayability does get boosted with the ability to grab skills based on the missions you take on. There's an element of strategy that's present here in the way that you grab minions and their specific strategies and weaknesses they have against each other. It's not going to stick around long, while there is some replayability, it's too simple at the surface, and the game isn't too complicated in the end. But it's solid for a cheap price, and has a couple of cheesy moments to help make the game a little bit more out there in the end. There will be a bug here and there, and it's not the most visually appealing game out there, but it does the job where it needs to in its gameplay. \n\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/w_N_4mjAexg[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Core tactics are reasonable for the price, especially considering the idea of replayability and the different traits that you can take.\n[*] Good introduction to basis strategy mechanics. Not too complicated, but complicated enough to cause you to actual attempt to \n[*] Story moments have groan inducing humor, but honestly that is a plus in my book as it did get a laugh or two out of me.\n[*] Do like the randomization elements in there, even if they may be imbalanced over time. \n[*] Seems reasonable for the price that it's going for. \n[*] Visuals do have a certain charm to them in the end. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Veterans of the tactics genre won't find enough here to keep them entertained over a long period of time. \n[*] The music does get repetitive after a while, even if I wasn't necessarily expecting that much out of it.\n[*] Main campaign is short despite replayability. \n[*] A bug here and there. In particular, certain character specific events can cause unmovable states due to not being able to select any more minions. \n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
