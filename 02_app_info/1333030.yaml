    about_the_game: Block motion is a puzzle / design game where you place functional
      blocks to design a working factory that assembles the desired output. Build
      your design, press play and watch your factory in action. You have the freedom
      to solve the challenges any way you want; The only limit is your imagination.<br><br><strong>Design!</strong><br>Assemble
      your solutions and watch them run in real time. Between the campaign of 29 challenges
      and the workshop tools to easily download player made challenges you will find
      no end to the amount of time you can spend coming up with new designs for solutions.<br><br><strong>Improve!</strong><br>Use
      the histograms to see how well your solutions perform compared to those made
      by other players. Refine your solutions to improve your scores and earn achievements.<br><br><strong>Set
      your own goals!</strong><br>You can connect up blocks of different types to
      create an almost limitless number of solutions. There is no single correct way
      to solve to a challenge, just different designs. If you're not feeling competitive
      you can turn off the histograms, set your own goals and just play the game the
      way you want to.<br><br><strong>Customize!</strong><br>The level editor is built
      right into the game itself. Create your own challenges using the same tools
      that I used to create the campaign. Publish your level to the Steam Workshop
      and see the scores achieved by other players on the histograms as they build
      their solutions to your challenge.

    review: Block motion allows you to utilize and combine several simple types of
      mechanisms in order to reach infinite creative solutions.  Would highly recommend
      to those who like interactive logic puzzles, or building in general.
