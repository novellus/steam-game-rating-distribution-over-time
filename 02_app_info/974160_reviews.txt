Placeholder sound effects voiced by the developer (yes, including the animal noises and the rotating bzzz bzzz of a security camera). Hitboxes that clearly don't line up with the animals. The \"genocide\" missions are so much harder than all the others that it can't be deliberate. A main menu screen that's really hard to navigate. Animal characters with so few polygons you can't recognise them from the portraits until you've played a few levels. And instant-lose conditions (such as a wolf eating a squirrel, when you're trying to kill all the raccoons) that you don't even see happen. This could be a great game when it's had a bit of polish and tuning, but right now it's so unfinished it's more annoying than fun.","timestamp_created":1561930462,"timestamp_updated":1561930462,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJws+6T1esCcsLdyAE="}
