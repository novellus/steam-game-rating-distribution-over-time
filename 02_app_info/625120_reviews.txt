Graphics are cool, mechanics is simple, gameplay is fun.  But control and camera are rude, sometimes is hard see what weapon have the character, and full screen can bring troubles if not select the lesser resolution. Is really short: complete the game takes about 3 hours, with 80% of achievements. Looks like a 90's ends arcade, or a beta version to test market reaction before launch an indie bigger project. Maybe is to bloody for children. To buy with a huge discount or in bundles.","timestamp_created":1572987140,"timestamp_updated":1572990741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540653407573699951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oL3jnu4CdN7t1wE="}
