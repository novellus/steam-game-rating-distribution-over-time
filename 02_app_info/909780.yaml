    review: 'At first I did not like this game.  The game does not do a great job
      of explaining the various mechanics, and there are quite a few.  Once I figured
      out how to repair and recharge at maintenance stations, and purchase ammo, the
      game became fairly manageable, with the exception of some boss fights.  Some
      of the fights seemed dependent on luck and when fighting the final boss, I had
      a few attempts where I was fairly unlucky and died almost immediately.  This
      boss also included a lot of terminal interaction while avoiding the boss and
      other enemies, and just didn''t feel great.  I think a part of the problem was
      simply how slow you are, even with some boost upgrades.


      That being said, I did enjoy this game and would recommend it.  It is very polished
      and does a lot of things right.  The interactions within the pod feel great,
      and the menu system is really well done.  I liked that the holographic menus
      could be moved around dynamically.  Unfortunately, the game is too brief to
      utilize many of the more in depth mechanics, such as upgrades, but the game
      could definitely be expanded on with this groundwork.'
