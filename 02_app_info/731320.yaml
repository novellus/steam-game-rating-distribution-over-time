    review: 'Too generic and repetitive.


      There are 200 levels but 90% of them feel the same.


      New mechanics are introduced VERY slowly.


      There is a speedrun timer in game but no goal times to aim for.


      No motivation to go for the collectibles because they often feel like an annoying
      chore rather than an optional challenge.


      There are shadows, but no "drop shadow" to help orient yourself while trying
      to land from a jump.


      ---------------------


      In general, not a badly made game by any means. But incredibly lacking, especially
      for the price. You would be much better off putting your money towards any other
      number of platform games.'
