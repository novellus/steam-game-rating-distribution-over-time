I really think this could be the one! Fantastic design, really unique multi-ball mechanic, and out of all the remake tables it has the most enjoyable sound effects. I LOVE the retro sci-fi sound and feel to it.\n\nThis is one of the rare remakes that I feel are legitimately better than the original. I don't often say that, because I typically prefer the EM and SS tables of old. But this one just feels so well-crafted.\n\nOn principle, I don't usually write reviews for Early Access titles.  But after having played from the Zaccaria catalog for so much time now, I thought it was time I start doing so for some of these.  I bought the Platinum bundle way back when, and whenever a new table comes out, it only costs me a dollar.  This was one of those tables.  \n\nThat bundle has more than paid for itself, and whenever a table of this quality comes out, I feel like I should be paying them more.  Their pricing scheme is extremely generous compared to other digital pinball companies out there - and this is coming from someone who absolutely detests the whole concept of DLC and microtransactions.","timestamp_created":1566606563,"timestamp_updated":1566606563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.724495232105255127","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46+LB4OwCeOP40AE="}
