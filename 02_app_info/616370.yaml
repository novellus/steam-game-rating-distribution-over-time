      began with an attempt of a frontal breakthrough of the Mareth defensive line.
      After a massive bombing and a fire assault, British forces consisting of 50th

      Durham Light Infantry crossed Wadi Zigzaou and captured two small bridgeheads
      on the left bank: Ouerzi and Ksiba Ouest. The main obstacle for continuing the

    review: 'Regardless of the side chosen, this is a skin of your teeth experience
      with long drawn out battles over difficult, expansive terrain for crummy little
      strong points.


      As the British, severe man power shortages, crappy tanks and traffic jams. As
      the Germans, watching endless artillery barrages melt everything.


      Wouldn''t recommend this for the newcomer, just too protracted and tense.'
