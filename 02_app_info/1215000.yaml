      \ /><br><br><strong>Movement Is LIFE</strong><br>Tired of standing in place\
      \ while enemies rush at you? Tired of being forced to teleport around Virtual\
      \ Reality like a goon? Do you wish you could <i>just move</i> in VR without\
      \ needing to lie down afterwards? Well, we\u2019ve got some good news for you.<br>We\
      \ built STRAYLIGHT around the Fling Engine, a new way to move in Virtual Reality\
      \ that is perfectly comfortable even for those brand new to VR, and with none\
      \ of the disorientation or nausea that plagues typical VR movement. But wait,\
      \ you say, a rare few experience discomfort in Virtual Reality no matter what\
      \ kind of game it is! Well, yes, unfortunately, that is true. But hundreds and\
      \ hundreds of people who have <i>never experienced</i> VR before have not only\
      \ played STRAYLIGHT without any discomfort, but they had <i>tons of fun</i>\
      \ doing it. It\u2019s true!<br>In STRAYLIGHT, you can fling yourself around\
      \ like a crazed space monkey, and it won\u2019t make your favorite aunt feel\
      \ dizzy.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1215000/extras/Devil_Star_1.1.gif?t=1606279453\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong>That\u2019s Cool And All, But What Is The Game?</strong><br>The\
      \ goal in STRAYLIGHT is simple: Get to the end. But to do that, you\u2019re\
      \ going to have to <i>fly</i>. You\u2019re going to have to dodge and swing\
      \ and soar, avoiding deadly obstacles by the most razor-thin margins. You\u2019\
      re going to have to react faster than you can think, finding your own pathway\
      \ through these beautiful--and dangerous--cosmic playgrounds. <br>STRAYLIGHT\
      \ is all about the flow, all about mastering the Fling Engine to become an unstoppable\
      \ parkour space ninja; all about nailing that perfect run and making it through\
      \ the level without dying once. It\u2019s about swinging around a deadly crystal\
      \ ball just in time to barely avoid a deadly spinning crystal ring, and crowing\
      \ in triumph. It\u2019s also about dying, over and over and over again, until\
      \ you become transcendent. It\u2019s about telling those who say you can\u2019\
      t move around in Virtual Reality \u2018Oh yeah? Watch <i>this</i>.\u2019<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1215000/extras/Leviathan_1.1.gif?t=1606279453\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong>Hey! There\u2019s No Platforms In Your Platforming Game!</strong><br>We\
      \ know. That\u2019s on <i>purpose</i>. STRAYLIGHT is a challenging experience\
      \ meant to evoke the best feelings and gameplay of old-school platforming games\
      \ (which we love) but evolved for Virtual Reality. Get to the end, collect the\
      \ cubes, time that perfect jump and avoid death by milliseconds; the spirit\
      \ of platforming lives on in STRAYLIGHT. The best platforming games were punishingly\
      \ hard and this game is no exception; it is not for the faint of heart. So,\
      \ are you ready to fly? Are you ready to move like you never have before? Are\
      \ you ready to master\u2026 THE STRAYLIGHT?"

    short_description: Fly, swing and soar through a beautiful and deadly universe
      in a new kind of VR platforming experience. Using the Fling Engine - a propulsion
      mechanic designed for totally comfortable movement in VR - you will soar too
      high, fly too fast, and die way too much. Will you master the STRAYLIGHT?

    developer_response: "Thanks for the review @kleegon! The good news is we definitely\
      \ have not abandoned the game, and agree with you that the game is currently\
      \ too short! We should have a progress update in the next couple days. To be\
      \ candid, Covid impacted each of us on the team differently, but collectively,\
      \ it drew our progress to a halt. \n\nTo give you a heads up, we have been creating\
      \ new levels, as well as new music and other features which we will roll out\
      \ for the full release. We have an internal date set which I'm hesitant to state\
      \ as we haven't made it official JUST yet. :) \n\nBut thank you for playing\
      \ and we welcome more of your feedback!"

    review: While I did enjoy the game,  it was too short, and the dev apparently
      has abandoned the game.   No updates since May.  No communication in the Discussion
      forum.  Too bad, the game had potential.
