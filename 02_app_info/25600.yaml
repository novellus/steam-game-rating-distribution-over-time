    about_the_game: "Eschalon: Book I is an old-school role-playing game that will\
      \ take you across massive outdoor environments and deep into dozens of sprawling\
      \ dungeons as you seek to uncover the mystery of who you are. It features a\
      \ tile-built, turn-based game world where the result of absolutely every action\
      \ is rolled, calculated or statistically determined. Hundreds of items and dozens\
      \ of creatures await your discovery in this classically inspired RPG.      \
