    review: "I wanted to really enjoy this game. I feel like I gave it an honest try.\
      \ But in the end it's just not an enjoyable enough experience to continue playing.\
      \ The developer is great. He responds to feedback and frequently updates the\
      \ game. But at it's core it doesn't make me want to play more of it.\n\nPros:\
      \ \nThe controls and combat feel great\n\nCons:\nThe levels are basically the\
      \ same thing over and over and they only way they scale is through more hp and\
      \ more damage for the monsters.\n The loot does not scale accordingly, nor is\
      \ there enough of it to truly call it lootcraft. There is a potion that increases\
      \ rarity of item drops by 4% for 6 minutes. But I can easily go 10-15 minutes\
      \ without finding any weapons or armor to take advantage of that benefit.\n\n\
      The bosses are just scaled up versions of the monsters in the normal levels.\
      \ The only technique to beating them is wearing down their enormous amounts\
      \ of health.\n\nLevel ups don't really make you any stronger or give you more\
      \ attack power.\n\nMany of the monsters heal each other, and when combined with\
      \ already high health they can take forever to kill. This wouldn't be so bad\
      \ but there is a hidden timer that causes a poison cloud to come in and start\
      \ killing you if you take too long on the levels. \n\nOverall, I had enough\
      \ fun personally to spend $8 but I might not have made the purchase if I knew\
      \ I wouldn't finish the game out of frustration."
