    review: "This game is amazing but to short. Good steering, no crashes and straight\
      \ mission informations.\nAt the begin a little bit hard but if you find out\
      \ the mechanics it works great.\n\nPro :\n- Top atmosphere\n- very nice Graphics\n\
      - KI is good\n- clear spoken mission Infos\n\ncontra :\n- to short !\n- not\
      \ very much to upgrade just only the guns and rockets.\n\nThis game could be\
      \ more than this but it is worth buying it on sales actions.\nI played around\
      \ 6 hours and passed through.\n\n@ the developers (just 2 of them ! crazy, one\
      \ additonal actor also) :\n\n- Try to design a story around it\n- implement\
      \ ingame docking sequences between dog fights\n- implement ship upgrading possibility\n\
      - implement a difficult selector (it is to easy at all)\n- maybe ship selection\
      \ with different weapons for different mission styles \n\n"
