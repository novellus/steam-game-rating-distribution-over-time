This is always in service of getting one or more boxes from point A to point B. You can have half a dozen past versions of yourself running around a stage, gravity being inverted, and it's the building blocks of a solid puzzle experience.\n\nPros:\nI love the atmosphere of the game, such as the minimalist sound design. The strange geometry the world is made of does a great job preparing the player to lose all sense of \"down\". Gravity flipping and multiple time loops, all combined with required 3D spacial awareness are building blocks for insane challenges. \n\nCons:\n-As great as those building blocks are, I don't feel like they were used to their fullest extent. The most challenging puzzles -felt more like busy work than an actual challenge of sequence. It seems like the concept wasn't fully cooked.\n-What was most annoying of all, were these art student quotes at the start of each level, and violent breaks in flow where control of your character is lost and your vision turns wide screen. They are annoying and entirely unnecessary. These moments broke all immersion. \n-There were also times I'd accidentally grab the cores of my past lives and entirely ruin the chain I was building up to, and have to start all over. All I was trying to do was fast-forward. This happened to me a lot. \n\nConclusion:\nTranspose annoyed me. It challenged me, it bored me. When you distill the game down, there's two moments that will stick with me: The first time I had to throw a box to myself in different gravity orientations, which blew my ever loving mind. Second, the last moment of the game, after spending an hour on the final puzzle, finally getting the door open, I stopped and played the entire winning timeloop. I watched six versions of myself running around completing tasks. Finally the last version of myself slamdunks that final box. I watched myself shoot both hands into the air and do a victory lap. I felt like a satisfied older brother to myself at that moment. That's going to stay with me the rest of my life. \n\nI hope Secret Location creates a sequel to Transpose one day. There's a lot of room for quality of life improvements, as well as the untouched potential of what challenges this is already capable of. Hell, you can run a sequence using four lives, then delete the third life in that chain, and that mechanic as a puzzle's solution was never touched upon! The potential here is limitless.","timestamp_created":1609493625,"timestamp_updated":1609493625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ivfS3vYCeOasvwI="}
