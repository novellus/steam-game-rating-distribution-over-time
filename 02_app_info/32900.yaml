    review: 'Using a 4k tv this game is no good on 4k the menu screen keeps stopping
      working when I change resolution and on 1080 resolution the UI is way too small
      and the pointer is way to big it covers the part of the screen that tells you
      what things are so requesting a refund

      I think enough time has passed and a restaurant empire 3 is way overdue!!!'
