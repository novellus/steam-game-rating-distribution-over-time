      /><br><strong>A six shooter is all you have in a world of sand, dust, and blood...</strong><br><br>Dead
      Horizon is a short and dirty point and click adventure game for your home computer
      system. Play as Bonnie Starr, a former farmgirl turned infamous pistoleer as
      she attempts to gain redemption at the end of a gun.<br><br>Dead Horizon is
      inspired by the light gun games of old. No, not Area 51, Time Crisis or Virtua
      Cop. The real old ones, like the original Wild Gunmen, Namco Quick &amp; Crash,
      and Mad Dog McCree. This game was inspired by those and the developer's own
      fascination with westerns and their machismo focused story lines on masculinity,
      murder, and guns. This game has all those things, and more! And it's 100% free!
      And very, very short.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features Include:</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gameplay
      only involves the mouse. We've cut out those useless fidgety bits, like keyboards!<br></li><li>Out
      of date graphics, like you remember from that childhood before you were born!<br></li><li>Out
      of date soundtrack, so fabulous you'll want to own it separately!<br></li><li>Quickdraw

      charging for it!<h2 class="bb_tag">The hard sell:</h2><br>Dead Horizon takes
      less than ten minutes to play, but a lot of sweat and a LOT of tears went into

    reviews: "\u201CEvery second of this game oozes love and care. It's a short title\
      \ but it drew me and kept me wrapped up for the entire duration.  PLAY THIS\
      \ GAME.\u201D<br>Thumbs up \u2013 <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009356170/recommended/671700/\"\

      gotta say this is the first time in a while i can honestly say that a point\
      \ and click game is truly fun\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/698298\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Newgrounds Reviewer - Nanocon</a><br><br>\u201C\
      My only complaint is I was left wanting more much more. The gameplay although\
      \ simplistic is addictive and could really work given more varibles and situations.\u201D\
