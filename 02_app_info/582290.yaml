    review: "Update #1 03/17/2020: The fall damage problem has been fixed. The game\
      \ is still really buggy and I still don't feel I can recommend it in it's current\
      \ state but it is definitely closer to a \"recommend\" than I thought it would\
      \ be at this point. At the very least, it's kind of playable at this point and\
      \ you can make some progress. \n\nFundamentally broken in just about every way\
      \ imagineable. I thought the game couldn't possibly be as bad as the other reviewers\
      \ made it out to be. I was wrong. It was even worse."
