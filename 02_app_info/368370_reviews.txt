It doesn't have an ending, it barely has an objective. It's a collection of videos. If the game makes you interested in the protagonist's story, then maybe you will keep watching the videos, trying to understand what exactly happened. Too boring for my taste.","timestamp_created":1610180935,"timestamp_updated":1610180935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41eeQ8/YCfpbgwQI="}
