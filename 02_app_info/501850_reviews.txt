It's actually surprisingly good and a lot of fun. Nice level design with hidden items and shortcuts. You have to replay each level many times to find the right paths and gather the items and I've had fun in each of my attempts so far. \nDefinitely worth the low price. \nThe last two levels of world 1 have only ever been finished by me and another person which was quite shocking to see. \nSo please, if you read this, give the game a try and beat my scores. This game deserves to be played a lot more.\nI still am far from completing. There are 3 worlds with 15 levels and one bonus level each. \nA total of 48 levels to Drive, Crash and Repeat.\nDifficulty varies from tolerable to pure insanity.\nNot suggested for completionists since this will become a frustrating task.","timestamp_created":1610148723,"timestamp_updated":1610148723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k/eV8vYCd57VwQI="}
