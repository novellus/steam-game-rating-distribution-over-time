    review: "This game was surprisingly fun! It has some flaws, sure, but it is remarkably\
      \ effective in its core goal: To care you. The game is truly an exercise in\
      \ isolation. Your character wakes up and you are given no information to go\
      \ on. So you explore. As you do you find your objectives. Simple fun.\n\nThe\
      \ scares are what are truly exciting though. I did not expect much as all, after\
      \ all, it is a $0.99 game with a HUD ripped right from Halo. The scares are\
      \ simple, but really effective. If you've ever watched Doctor Who, it'll seem\
      \ familiar. \n\nI had a lot of fun, and if you're just looking for a quick silly\
      \ game with some decent scares, I would 100% recommend it. Though I will say,\
      \ I think it would be more fun for someone who is streaming and interacting\
      \ with an audience, as the game does have lulls in the action."
