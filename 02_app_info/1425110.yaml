    about_the_game: "Space Empires I is the first chapter of the Space Empires series.\
      \ A classic galactic conquest and turn-based strategy video game where you are\
      \ the leader of a race of intelligent beings building large spaceships for interplanetary\
      \ and interstellar travel through warp points between star systems.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nYou will meet extraterrestrial races while fighting for survival and\
      \ conducting diplomacy signing treaties between empires, trade agreements to\
      \ full-blown partnerships, and even create protectorates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      In Space Empires, the player assumes the role of the single leader of a race\
      \ of intelligent beings that has recently acquired the technology required to\
      \ build large fully space-based ships for interplanetary and interstellar travel.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting out with only a few possible hull sizes for their\
      \ ships, on which they can place any number of components to essentially create\
      \ a unique ship, the player can research new hull sizes and components to use\
      \ with them, eventually being able to build ships ten times the size of his\
      \ original hull size.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe components available to the player\
      \ can vary greatly, from ship bridges, long-range scanners and shield generators\
      \ to emergency supply components that, when used, will be destroyed but will\
      \ allow a ship to continue moving for a longer time, and of course, weapons\
      \ of various kinds, boarding parties, cloaking devices right up to Dyson sphere\
      \ construction material and star-destroying devices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ player can meet extraterrestrial races (which will inevitably happen as the\
      \ player expands their realm) and conduct diplomacy with them. Treaties can\
      \ be signed between two empires, varying from the basic trade agreement to full-blown\
      \ partnerships and even protectorates. The player can also conduct intelligence\
      \ operations, from simple information gathering missions, to ship bombs, to\
      \ inciting rebellion on a planet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterstellar travel in\
      \ Space Empires is not faster-than-light drive based, but instead relies on\
      \ anomalies called &quot;warp points&quot;, essentially wormholes between two\
      \ star systems. Warp points are naturally occurring but a player can open and\
      \ close these warp points if she or he has the appropriate technologies."

    review: 'I remember playing Space Empires way back ages ago, so I was pretty excited
      to pick the series on steam again and replay them.


      Sadly, Space Empires I is NOT FUNCTIONAL on windows 10 at this time.  It cannot
      process a single turn, crashing to desktop when ''end turn'' is pressed.  game
      load and save functions also do not work either.


      This should have been tested more before release.'
