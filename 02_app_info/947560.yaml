      solutions is available as a B-side to allow the players to switch rooms or to
      show a new friend the game while still enjoying a fresh experience. Each player
      must own a copy of the game in order to play. Players can join each other''s
      game instances via their Steam friend list or in-game invite system. Microphone
      usage is required as in-game mechanics and puzzles are used to detect the player''s
      voice.'
