    about_the_game: "It is the midcycle of Generation 24XX. As a renowned mystic investigator,\
      \ acting on intuition and perspective, sets out to assist her divinity guard\
      \ associates in matters related to a planned attack she ultimately comes up\
      \ short and late to arrival, with the guard leader spared only for as long as\
      \ her arrival is due which in turn sets up a divine incursion that seemingly\
      \ destroys her as the force of integrity is fused on position. But twenty years\
      \ later across the metaphysical divide on I Alpha, a programming technician\
      \ wakes up from visions of the incident and (believing it as just a nightmare)\
      \ proceeds to simply cast if off and goes about his day... until consequences\
      \ bring forth the same investigative associate who now finds herself many existential\
      \ worlds away from home. But the problems started upon the world of the investigator\u2019\
      s origination extend deeper than anyone expected, and the divine essence is\
      \ now threatening to implode upon itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLASSIC GAMEPLAY:\
      \ Unload special elemental skills, slice 'em with everything to swords and spears\
      \ (and even handgun ammunition!) and exploit the weakness of your enemies to\
      \ work on your advantage.<br />\r\nPERSONALITY MATTERS: No actions-say-everything\
      \ leadership here - in this adventure, EVERYONE has a say in the mission to\
      \ come.<br />\r\nUNEXPECTED PROVISIONS: From selfless intervention when it matters\
      \ to unconventional responses from persons and creatures that you wouldn't normally\
      \ expect it from, expect anything to drop without warning.<br />\r\nADVENT SPECIALS:\
      \ Turn the tide to your advantage by unloading special attacks which also boost\
      \ the capabilities of your associates.<br />\r\nWORLDS OF DANGER: From Echo\
      \ XXIV's subtropic utopia to Sigma XLII's frigid icecaps, other worlds in the\
      \ metaphysic expanse begin to play into the divine strategy as the mission progresses."
