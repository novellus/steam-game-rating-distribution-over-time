    review: 'Fantastic collection with tons of gorgeous art, music, and a smattering
      of avatars. The artbook gives tons of insight into Nowhere Prophet''s development
      cycle, showing off all the iterations of the combat UI and highlighting the
      design choices behind the world of Soma and each faction within it.


      While I would highly recommend this artbook to anyone who loved the artstyle
      of Nowhere Prophet, I [i]was[/i] disappointed by the selection of Avatars they
      had. I bought this artbook hoping to find a specific one, Con Man, but I suppose
      they were added post-release. Ah well.'
