It  is fun, it have different set of weapons and increasing difficulty, as expected in a game of this kind. It is fine for playing some minutes in between other games. The playbility is good, you feel good control and nice sound.\n\nI feel very positive that once you reach a level you can start next game in this level without to restart the game.","timestamp_created":1596905699,"timestamp_updated":1596905699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635215878486633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46+a/5/MCdIKdmgI="}
