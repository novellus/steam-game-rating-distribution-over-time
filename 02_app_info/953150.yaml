      \ world to prove they are the music king, you will be asked questions with multiple\
      \ choice options and possibly in the future even get presented with an audio\
      \ question where a track is played to you and you have to guess who the artist\
      \ is or what the title or album are and maybe even the release year is but the\
      \ audio part is still in the development phase. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs our game\
      \ grows we hope to add more modes and system to embrace the player even more\
      \ in our fun quirky environments. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrivaTune is a pure passion\
      \ project with a small team working to make the game in our vision, we want\
      \ to capture those moments<br />\r\nin the car when your fave song comes on\
      \ and you all start singing as if you were at the O2 arena. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nSO please enjoy our game as much as we enjoy making it!"
