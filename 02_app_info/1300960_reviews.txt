It's welcoming to play a game for once that is actually challenging at times and requires you to think about how the level can be completed. It is very satisfying when you figure out how to complete it and move on to the next stage - i feel smarter since playing it. \nIt keeps your interest as new game mechanics are introduced throughout the levels. There is so much detail within each level and I look forward to reading notes and speaking to humorous characters that contribute to the intriguing story and immerse you into the world. The art style of this game is stunning! I could use the background to every level as my desktop wallpaper. Also the soundtrack is subtle and positively adds to the atmosphere of the game. Although i'm only 6 hours in I can't wait to replay it so I can find all the collectables and secrets i may have missed. Would definitely recommend this game and I'm excited for what they are going to do next!","timestamp_created":1599402699,"timestamp_updated":1599402699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j431sfQCfeaXoAI="}
