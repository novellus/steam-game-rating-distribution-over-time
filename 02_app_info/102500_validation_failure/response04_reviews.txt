Would've easily earned a thumbs up if not for a game breaking bug I encountered in one of the DLCs. In The Legend of Dead Kel one of the missions has an necessary NPC get stuck behind a wall of fallen boulders and become inaccessible. This NPC is supposed to return you to town, and in the place where you are when this bug occurs, fast travel is disabled. The game saves right at the start of the dungeon, which you cannot exit, and inevitably leads to the bug therefore ruining your save file. If you do buy this game ---> MAKE A SEPERATE SAVE FILE BEFORE DOING ANY DLC CONTENT <----. I spent 37 hours on this game only to not be able to finish due to this bug hardlocking my game.","timestamp_created":1610123841,"timestamp_updated":1610123841,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533011257648468018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43oG38fYCcoDKwQI="}
