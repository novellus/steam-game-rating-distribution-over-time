    review: "When I played the first version, I was frustrated because it didn't have\
      \ a story and it had some bugs.\nHowever, recently the game was updated to a\
      \ new version and I had a big surprise: Everything has been changed !! The developer\
      \ redid the game completely! It is practically another game!\nThis new build\
      \ is completely improved. I think he felt that the initial result was unsatisfactory.\
      \ So he decided to start again in a gesture of respect for the user. Congratulations\
      \ on the demonstration of professionalism.\n\nI'll be honest: I didn't like\
      \ the first version. :-| (Boring...)\nNow, what I played was worth the investment.\
      \ Of course, we are not talking about an AAA game. I loved it!\nI liked this\
      \ update! It has action, a compelling story and a very fun dynamic. :-)\nTry\
      \ playing!\nGameplay \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Graphic \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\
