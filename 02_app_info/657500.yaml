    review: This is a creditable computer version of the board game, Hold The Line.  It
      is fun to play when I don't have human opponent to play the board game.  It
      takes the 'book keeping' out of the game and is very easy to play. The only
      drawback is that the AI does not appear to be too creative. It plays each game
      fairly much the same and requires me to play at the hardest level to make it
      as competitive as possible. One request; I would like all the scenarios of the
      board game included in the computer version, and include the French and Indian
      War Expansion. Overall if you like the board game, I believe you would like
      this game.
