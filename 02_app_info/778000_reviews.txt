Each room is like a mini puzzle. The game really challenged me to first figure out how to get past each room and then execute it. For some rooms, the solution is simple, but the execution is hard. For others, both the solution and the execution will take some time.\n\nOverall, this game is really well thought out with very intricately designed rooms with unique solutions to each. The gameplay is simple and intuitive and the game is really easy to get into. As an added bonus, the soundtrack is amazing. Would definitely recommend.","timestamp_created":1588793682,"timestamp_updated":1588793682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhfXe9fECdvOEhgI="}
