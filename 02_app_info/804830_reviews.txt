This are some big problems but good parts too.\n\nPokemon with tits and ass. Solid writing, self aware and funny with lots of meta jokes, and adult humor. The gameplay is a solid pokemon type rpg. Gallery system for viewing the monstergirls. It has lots of promise. I wish steam had a neutral recommendation. In its current state I cant recommend it without caveats. Its riddled with bugs, and could use a huge polish pass. \nAs far as I can tell none of the equipment works, thankfully the healing consumables work or it would be a whole lot harder. The Nympapedia (pokedex) doesn't show info about any of the girls or their moves. Sometimes when you load your game, your items or girls wont load. restarting usually fixes things. Changing the keybindings doesn't seem to work. Gamepads sometimes stop working. No manual saving, and sometimes that leads to having to redo areas. and the most egregious problem is the uncesor method seems not to work.\nThat being said, even with the number of bugs its still playable if you have a high tolerance for weird stuff.\n\nWorst of all, the devs last comment seems to be about 4 months ago, meaning none of this will likely be fixed. \n","timestamp_created":1565142545,"timestamp_updated":1565142545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533792197704315186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pv7wtOwCdrLwzwE="}
