      of the core content of the game will be moddable. Modders will be able to change
      graphical assets (images, animations), add entirely new items and units, tweak
      existing core content and more. As with most moddable games this will increase
      replayability and longevity of the game.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1475310/extras/03122020_productline.gif?t=1609094683"
