    review: "I love roguelikes, and I\u2019ve actually been on the lookout for a shorter\
      \ session \u201Ccoffee break\u201D roguelike for a while now. It\u2019s been\
      \ really tough finding a game that is both immersive and easy to pick up, but\
      \ still feels rewarding in spite of the little time you put into it.\n\nIn the\
      \ House of Silence is an interesting mix of mechanics and aesthetics. It\u2019\
      s like if you took the art style and atmosphere of Don\u2019t Starve, mixed\
      \ that with the item building mechanics of the Binding of Isaac, and threw it\
      \ all together with some traditional turn-based roguelike gameplay. It\u2019\
      s really fun and strangely addictive! \n\nI feel there is huge potential here,\
      \ and I really hope the developer is able to keep expanding things throughout\
      \ Early Access.\n\nAs of right now (0.3a), there are about 5-6 floors and no\
      \ bosses, just normal mobs. There is no in-game tutorial yet (apart from a \u201C\
      how to play\u201D text screen on the menu), but the game is simple enough to\
      \ pick up within a few minutes.  Movement is turn-based in 4 directions (no\
      \ diagonal movement) and attacking simply involves pressing the directional\
      \ key towards enemy. There are currently no character levels, equipment or stats,\
      \ but you pick up a bunch of interesting mutations and simple one-use items\
      \ (health pots, teleports, shields etc.) which enable you to evolve your character\
      \ and playstyle. Mutations include things like double movement, more damage\
      \ when low sanity, item drops on mob death etc. and help spice things up and\
      \ keep things engaging. Although the start can be tough, once you get a few\
      \ mutations it feels very satisfying to play and watch everything work together.\
      \ \n\nOverall, I actually found the combat quite forgiving in comparison to\
      \ the sanity mechanic, as every step decreases your sanity and there is a bit\
      \ of RNG in whether you get enough items or mutations to alleviate it throughout\
      \ the levels. If your sanity drops to zero 3 times (the bar shortens every time,\
      \ too), it\u2019s game over.\n\nThe current line-up of monstrosities are well\
      \ designed and combat in general is very fair. All monsters have some attack\
      \ or movement pattern, or fit within a specific niche - i.e., ultra low health\
      \ but super high damage. Depending on what mutations you find and what items\
      \ you have will depend on what mobs remain dangerous and also how many you can\
      \ tackle at once. Unless you're stacking a bunch of rare mutations and items,\
      \ taking on more than 2 almost always ends in death (but hey, that's roguelikes\
      \ for you!).\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with this and I\
      \ can appreciate the simplicity of the game, I think it could also end up being\
      \ the game\u2019s biggest weakness. I know more mutations, enemies and levels\
      \ will likely come in time, but I still feel the game may be missing that one\
      \ extra layer of complexity which helps it stand the test of time. As there\
      \ are no character levels, stats, armour, spells or weapons, it\u2019s only\
      \ really the mutations and mob/level arrangement that changes each run, so adding\
      \ more of this is just kind of stretching it out, rather than making it deeper.\
      \ I think the game could really benefit from some extra layers of mechanics\
      \ to make runs even more interesting and to give players a little more flexibility\
      \ over their playstyle. \n\nThe floors also feel a bit empty right now. The\
      \ game could really use more interactive elements and reasons to explore past\
      \ just the exit. Lore snippets, friendly NPCs, secret rooms/tunnels, high risk\
      \ high reward encounters and random collectables. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m really\
      \ excited to see how this game evolves! It\u2019s a little bare-bones right\
      \ now, so if you\u2019re expecting hours and hours of content I\u2019d say hold\
      \ off until later in the EA period. If you\u2019re like me, and don\u2019t have\
      \ a ton of time anyway, and are looking for an enjoyable and easy to pick up\
      \ roguelike, I highly recommend it!"
