On the way to being savior of the world I killed every single one of the people dear to me by miraculously trusting the hidden villain 10 times out of 10. \n\nBut I got a cool weapon from this dragon I killed and it's all okay.\n\nI used to give crap to Argenta for verbally abusing me every minute she sees me but she really is right. I am an utterly incompetent fool. I run around making bigger messes of everything, messes that often require one or another npc's life to clean up.\n\nBut in all seriousness, DN is a decent game.\n\nIt's a fun time waster. The battle system is fun and I didn't mind the grind (which, compared to some of the mmorpgs I've played in the past, wasn't really difficult at all. When I picked it back up I made cap on my legacy whatever char in 3 days and the other one hit 90s in a week, I wasn't even playing nonstop). I got bored eventually because I didn't really feel committed. And as for the story, well. I guess it's interesting, I was intrigued enough to follow it despite having to run the same 3 dungeons on repeat for each part (honestly, who decides to live in a place constantly infected with monstrocities and decide not to move?) But I was really serious when I say the PC is literally the stupidest, most gullible person alive. The main quest is always the shady person out of the cast of the characters asking you to fetch some god awful, powerful evil device for \"good\" and the pc shrugging and saying \"Why not? What harm could you possibly do with it, guy I just met yesterday?\" \n\nTldr; If you like the battle system and don't mind playing it like a solo player (because just about everything except hardcore endgame content is doable alone if you have enough time and skill), then this is great. If you are expecting a welcome community, this isn't for you. If not for having friends that asked me to play this game with them I could probably go from level 1 to cap without talking to a single soul and that's something most people (me included) is not prepared to do.","timestamp_created":1488258476,"timestamp_updated":1488258630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500170886516571045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl5DIwdoCeeKqcw=="}
