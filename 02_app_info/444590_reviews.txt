I didn't expect anything, I just really liked the pixel graphic design as it reminded me a little of Count Lucanor… I didn't even know what kind of game it's going to be exactly, but I loved it!\n\nIt starts simply. You are pulled from your grave to stop the Fog from spreading. To achieve that you have to defeat the one who beckoned it. The path won't be as simple though. You need to navigate a large mansion and its grounds filled with twisted servants to find Beckoners Knights, who hold the keys to him. Among the enemies you can meet NPCs who will shed a bit of a light on the situation and events that lead to the spreading of the Fog. But beware as every step brings you closer towards insanity and you can see the world twisting. Can you fulfill your quest and overcome these horrors?\n\nThe pixel graphic is perfect. Twisted (this word really suits this game), bloody, gory… the deeper you go down the rabbit hole, the nastier it gets. Pretty. <3 Soundtrack is setting a great feeling to the spreading insanity. Story is very interesting, to fully comprehend it you have to search every crook to find more and more of the lore (there are a lot of things to click at). The game is full of Lovecraftian symbols, hints and it creates a pretty creepy atmosphere! Although there is not a lot of space for some deep character development I find them nicely written, they are interesting, enjoyable and likeable (even hate-able - good thing)! Luckily it has sequels so here I hope for some new information on my favorite ones. ;)\n\nControls are… well strange and it took me some time to grow accustomed to them, but after that it was fine. Fight is challenging, very much. Just getting through the tutorial level cost me more than 5 deaths. But even though you will often die, it's not frustrating… well, for me at least. I haven't rage quit as with some other similar games (if we consider the fact that some are describing it as \"Souls-like\" then it's a miracle as I have quit the Dark Souls after, eh, 6 hours). In total there are four different endings, you also have New game+ which gets the difficult level in crazy highs and it's a little slap on your face as you get better and really strong and then you start anew and again you die in a tutorial. XD There are also two challenge levels after you beat the game, insanely hard. I have done it after getting the four endings and playing through it two more times.\n\nI have enjoyed Skautfold very much and can't wait to start the next game! There is only one thing I didn't like and although I maybe understand why it wasn't available (as it has a continuous purpose), I still think it should have been an option. The inability to do so made me rather disappointed. If you like pixel graphics, horror settings and novels from H.P.Lovecraft, I can only recommend it to you!","timestamp_created":1609091107,"timestamp_updated":1609322427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548406124114990234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p+7F2fYCdqzpvQI="}
