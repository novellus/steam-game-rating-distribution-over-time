    about_the_game: '<strong>Pertinence</strong> is a top-down adventure with minimalist
      graphics that explores various puzzle and action mechanics. The goal of the
      game is to freely explore rooms in a grid layout while collecting as many &quot;alloy&quot;
      as possible. These will unlock new areas and abilities.<br>To create an environment
      of self-discovery and curiosity, Pertinence instructs the player as little as
      possible.<br>The layout of the game allows you to pick and choose from various
      puzzle/action areas as you progress. Not all alloy need to be collected. Some
      are harder to collect than others.<br><br><u>Gameplay Features</u><br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>The ability to bend and warp &quot;soft&quot; walls to your
      advantage (or to your <i>disadvantage</i>)<br></li><li>&quot;Nodes&quot; are
      an important mechanic in Pertinence, but they require a long description (see
      below).<br></li><li>Collectible impermanence. You can only keep alloy if you

      boss.</li></ul><br>A <strong>Node</strong> is an object that can be encountered
      in Pertinence. If the player finds one early in the game, they may find that
      the Node cannot do anything. But later on, after gaining new abilities, the
      player can rotate them, drag them and throw them. <br>Nodes usually have &quot;distortion
      fields&quot; attached to them, allowing you to rotate, drag and throw the field.
      Think of &quot;the bending of walls&quot; as a physical substance that can be
      attached to a node. <br>Another feature of Nodes is that the player can throw
      them at bombs, which will then latch onto the Node. This allows the player to
      place bombs wherever he or she desires. <br>Nodes come in three different types:
      normal, locked and static. Normal Nodes can be rotated, dragged and thrown.
      Locked Nodes cannot be rotated, but can be dragged and thrown. Static Nodes
      can be rotated but cannot be dragged or thrown.<br><br><u>Miscellaneous Features</u><br><br><ul
