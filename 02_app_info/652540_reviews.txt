Just spent an hour in there.\n\nLots of things to see. The statues could be of a higher quality though, and the scale is a but off sometimes.\n\nFeedback for the developer:\n\nWhy make the small sculpture of Nefertete 5 meters tall though?\n\nSometimes I teleport myself under or outside the museum.\n\nSome descriptions are missing.\n\nThe Venus, Vulcan and Mars description doesn't have the right text. It's about a different painting.\n\nIn the menu it says 'Van Gogp' instead of Van Gogh.\n\nI really didnt like that all styles and periodes are often completely mixed (Rubens next to impressionists?)\n\nPlease, more paintings and sculptures! :)","timestamp_created":1510868467,"timestamp_updated":1572133740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qOehe4Cd6K7iwE="}
