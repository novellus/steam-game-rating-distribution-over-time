Sure the game is 0.79 cents, but that does not mean a game has to be bad.\n\nThe game has certainly some pros and cons.\nThe pros being that:\n- Playing with your mouse enhances movement big time, and a love that aspect.\n- The music is a 10/10.\n- The overall thought of design is cool: nice shapes etc.\n\nCons:\n- The graphics are so bad, that you can't really see any of the bullets you are shooting.\n- 9/10 times you cannot see what bullets are coming towards you, because the bullets or enemies match the background 100%.\n- The game is so bare, there are no settings, no info, nothing.\n\nEven though this game is 0.79 cents, I am not tempted the slightest to pick up the game again. Which is really sad, because with some tweaking, the game could really be so much better.","timestamp_created":1602486846,"timestamp_updated":1602486846,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo5jqjfUCeK2ypwI="}
