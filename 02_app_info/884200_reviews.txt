I'm guessing this is one of those games that \"require a server\", so multiplayer won't work, and forget singleplayer.\n\n[old review]\nThis game is nothing. There are no servers so you are stuck to play with bots. Actually. NO, screw the bots.\n\nThis 1.19$ game is actually a asset-flip of a broken template that cost almost 50 bucks. You pay 2% of what this creator paid.\n\nPS: Gui is extremly glitchy.","timestamp_created":1548528605,"timestamp_updated":1607033952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8IKslfYCds6kuQE="}
