Steam version.\n\nGraphics are very nice with good amount of detail. I like the textures used and I like the character models.\n\nAudio is OK. The laser guns make the right sci-fi sounds, however this is one area that could do with more love from the devs. Being hit by laser fire or a grenade is no existence.\n\nGameplay is like a Overwatch like, but not as good or nice. It's an arena shooter with 4 classes. Each class has it's own abilities. DPS, tank and healer etc. It's alot of fun and require some good team work to win.\n\nI did find some bugs playing on the Rift S. I got stuck in place for a bit, it drifts left and right plus I lost tracking on the right controller. Playing on the HP Reverb was fine minus the poor tracking of WMR. I had to use track-pad on the HP Reverb, no options for thumbs-sticks. Also on the Rift S you had to click in on the right stick to use snap turning and snap turning is my only options as of making my video.\n\nOverall it is fun, but it needs to fix the bugs and improve the audio. Also need to release of as many VR platform as possible with crossplay. If the developers doe these I think this game could be great. \n\n\n","timestamp_created":1586637680,"timestamp_updated":1586637680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2LW+tfECduGEgAI="}
