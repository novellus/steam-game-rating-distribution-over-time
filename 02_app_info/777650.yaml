      \ the game.<br>In this game, players need to work on boss\u2019s countless jobs\
      \ in order to make enough money for daily supply. Pressure of being fired, starving\
      \ or even being mentally destroyed is always a company of the research dog.<br>Of\
      \ course, you will also experience some interesting or surprising moments, for\
      \ examples, the colleague\u2019s help (or troubles), nice gift from your neighbor(or\
