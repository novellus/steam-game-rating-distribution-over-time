    review: Was Ok. Then got to the chapter where the boy and girl switch. Then the
      game launches with no sound. Tried troubleshooting all I couldf. All other games
      and apps work fine. Something likely corrupt with the install, so no choice
      but to uninstall. Not gonna bother waiting for it to download and reinstall
      - or play email tag with customer support. Just unistall and move on to another
      game.
