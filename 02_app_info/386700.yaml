    reviews: "\u201CI've had a huge amount of fun with The Oil Blue, and with good\
      \ reason - it's challenging, it's gorgeous and it's by far the most unique experience\
      \ I've played in a good while. This is something to officially 'be excited about'\

      It's not common to see a tycoon game that goes for atmosphere, but The Oil Blue\
      \ does just that, and it does it well....What it lacks in complexity it more\
      \ than makes up for in playability and raw intrigue. The Oil Blue looks great,\
      \ plays great, and will suck you in for hours at a time. An excellent release\
      \ from Vertigo Games!\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/review/the-oil-blue.php\"\

      Games like The Oil Blue are always a pleasant surprise. We often expect nothing\
      \ from them and they deliver an experience that is nothing sort of a joy. Vertigo\
      \ games should be proud of what they\u2019ve created here, and anyone interested\
      \ in playing something great should check this out.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2010/07/02/oil-blue-review/\"\

    review: 'If u want something with an easy 100% steam achievement unlocked this
      is a good game.

      Also remains addictive trying to achieve the goals.

      Simple and fun.
