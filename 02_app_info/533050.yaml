    review: "[h1]A hit-or-miss roguelite but a good short shmup[/h1]\nThe developers\
      \ decided it was time to reinvent the shmup, which initiative I can only applaud.\
      \ Exploiting the replayability aspect of a roguelite sounded great on paper.\
      \ But the first impression is very mixed.\n\nWhen playing a roguelite, you generally\
      \ expect  a bit of diversity in the runs and the possibility of using various\
      \ strategies in function of whatever powers you can unlock within runs or in-between\
      \ runs. There is literally zero variety here and the levels are chained in the\
      \ same sequence, like in any traditional shmup, withouth variability. And no\
      \ strategy either. The friends' powers don't really bring anything else than\
      \ \"more power\" or \"more health regen\" to your gameplay.\n\nYou can unlock\
      \ some non-gameplay elements in the form of dialogs between your party members\
      \ which, if you unlock all of them, give you access to the real ending. This\
      \ sounded like a good idea, unfortunately the dialogs here are a bit cringe\
      \ and amateurish at first sight, with grammatical errors.\n\nUnlocking the good\
      \ ending seems definitely not worth the dozens of playthroughs it requires.\
      \ Or is it?\n\nDespite all that, the shmup part is pretty good, in fact even\
      \ better than a lot of indie shmups, even though the presentation is very modest\
      \ and un-spectacular. So you'll probably accept to replay it a couple times\
      \ before shelving the game. \n\nThen you might get used to the dialogs and realize\
      \ that the repetitivity of the run kinda work on the long time. Especially when\
      \ each run becomes easier and easier with supplementary unlocks.\nYou can enter\
      \ a \"zone\" and play it like solitaire as a way to pass time or empty your\
      \ mind.\nSo if you play it in that way, the \"roguelite\" aspect is okay and\
      \ works pretty well. Pretty much the same as a \"clicker game\", which is the\
      \ devs' original specialization. \nIn the later half of the game you unlock\
      \ enough ships and powers for some nice interactions to start happen in your\
      \ play-style.\n\nSo it's cheap and even cheaper on a sale and even as just a\
      \ one-time shmup it's extremely correct with coherent graphics and good gameplay,\
      \ so why not?\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url]\
      \ for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]"
