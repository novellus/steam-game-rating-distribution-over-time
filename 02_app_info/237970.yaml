    review: "A good adventure game with challenging puzzles and an intriguing philosophical\
      \ setting as well as decisions you have to make, that really change the outcome\
      \ of the game.\nAlso if you like the Secret Files series, this is for you.\n\
      One thing that I thought was a pity though is the fact that the beginning of\
      \ the game hinted at quite the mythology/archeology arch, maybe about ancient\
      \ african culture or the [spoiler] murder symbols [/spoiler] themselves could\
      \ have gotten some more background - sadly we end up in the most boring locations\
      \ to investigate. \nI personally would have liked a more adventurous/mythological-mystery\
      \ setting, but nevertheless it is a very fine game and absolutely recommended!\n\
      As for the technical problems:\nI had this thing too where it didn't start,\
      \ because the PhysX Driver was basically too recent and I have absolutely no\
      \ clue what happened, but after deinstalling and reinstalling it a few days\
      \ later it suddenly just worked. So Godspeed to everyone who encountered the\
      \ same problem. Keep trying! ;)"
