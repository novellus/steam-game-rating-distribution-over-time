    review: "[b]Let's Split Up[/b] is a visual novel full of non sequiturs and randomness.\
      \ It's pretty bad. \nThe writing is cringy as all hell, the game won't even\
      \ go into fullscreen mode and of course there are no in-game settings whatsoever.\
      \ Can't even adjust the volume. I think all the effort went into the drawings,\
      \ which,  credit where credit is due, are pretty nice. Everything else? Half-arsed."
