    review: "This is the first game that I have ever been #1 in the leaderboards and\
      \ it only took me 29 minutes.  Unfortunately, the game is not fun.  It is even\
      \ a game?  You basically swat flies.  You start the first 10 rounds with your\
      \ hands.  I found it was more fun to make a fist and pound the flies.  Problem?\
      \  Yeah, no bug juice.  No physics.  Flies end up with a quick death pose in\
      \ the air.  No fly crushed on the table.  No juices flowing.  Nothing.  The\
      \ bugs just lay there for the most part.  How do you miss?  Seriously, they\
      \ just fall there and then stay there.  \n\nWhen you pound them into nothingness,\
      \ your hands don't get dirty.  You have the hands of Thing from the Fantastic\
      \ Four for some unknown reason, except scaled down to tiny hands for even stranger\
      \ reasons.  No sound of your hands thumping the table.  How are you supposed\
      \ to feel satisfaction from your bug extermination?\n\nThen after the 10th wave,\
      \ you finally get a fly swatter.  Alright, just what we wanted.  But nope, it's\
      \ breaks really easily.  It doesn't feel satisfying.  The animations are all\
      \ wrong.  Doesn't feel at all like you're holding a fly swatter.  \n\nOkay,\
      \ but on the 15th wave, you get bug spray.  This will be fun.  Nope, again,\
      \ very unsatisfying to use.  The animations are poor.  Your bug spray runs out\
      \ quickly and you have to wait for recharge.  Actually, I recommend pounding\
      \ the table with your offhand and using the bug spray at other times.  \n\n\
      You finally get to #1 on the leaderboards.  Maybe that's worth .59 cents.  Like\
      \ being #1 at curling .. only probably not as satisfying as that.\n\nRating\
      \ 2/10 yeah, it's really bad"
