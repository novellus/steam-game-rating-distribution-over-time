    review: 'I was enjoying the game, it was a decent metroidvania with cool time
      travel mechanics in a sort of Majora''s Mask-meets-Sands of Time-meets-Xenoblade
      Chronicles kind of way. The story wasn''t anything special and there were a
      few gameplay annoyances but nothing that would ruin the experience. I was excited
      that this could really be a super obscure hidden gem that I could recommend
      to friends. But then after the first boss everything went downhill fast.


      Extremely obtuse progression routes, like a hidden path on the other side of
      a killing laser or a rock that grows and blocks the way if you don''t reach
      it in time, and of which there is no indication. The game''s controls are not
      exactly tight in general, but the wall running ability is especially finicky
      and that becomes a major part of the game later on. Oh and many of the areas
      start to become water levels where you control even worse. Why do developers
      keep including water levels, doesn''t everyone hate those?'
