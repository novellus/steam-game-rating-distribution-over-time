The story follows the character of Max Payne, an undercover DEA agent looking into the influx of the dangerous new drug known as Valkyr, when he is framed for the murder of his handler by a mysterious criminal organization. Haunted by the brutal deaths of his wife and infant daughter to Valkyr addicts years before, he cuts a bloody swath through New York's criminal underground, looking to clear his name and take revenge for his family's murder.\n\n--{Gameplay}--\n🔳Exceptional\n☑️Very good\n🔳Good\n🔳Poor\n🔳Atrocious\n\nTo those I've spoken to about Max Payne, they've described it as a 'classic'. I find it difficult to disagree with that assessment. Max Payne's gameplay, while a little rough around the edges, holds up incredibly well compared to other games of similar age. It reminds me a lot of Halo in that, despite its age, it's controls and gunplay still feel contemporary. \n\nIn terms of specifics, Max Payne offers about a dozen different weapons that are obtained in the course of a playthrough. Max Payne, being inspired by cult classic Hong-Kong action films, also was one of the first games to feature bullet-time, or slow motion movement. When combining your large arsenal of weapons and your action movie movement, Max Payne can create a very impressive spectacle while still being functional on a gameplay level. As most of the damage in Max Payne can be dodged through bullet time and good crowd control, regenerating health is absent. In its place are Painkillers (Ironic), which heal a portion of health per item. \n\nThe only major issue that I found with Max Payne from a gameplay perspective is enemy placement. Sometimes enemies will be placed in areas that are impossible to predict if you haven't already played through that section of the level before, forcing a reload.\n\n--{Graphics}--\n🔳Beautiful\n🔳Very Good\n🔳Good\n☑️Poor\n🔳Atrocious\n\nIt's a game from 2001, what do you want me to say? In all fairness, it looks incredible for a game that was developed before the onset of the 21st century. Today, in the far, far future of the dark present, it somehow still looks better than Fallout 76.\n\n--{Audio}--\n🔳Exceptional\n🔳Very good\n☑️Good\n🔳Poor\n🔳Atrocious\n\nAudio in Max Payne is a bit of a mixed bag. That said, there is more good than bad. This mainly comes down to environmental detail and enemy and weapon sounds. Weapons sounds in particular are very impressive, outclassing even some modern games with its bass and mixing. \n\nInstead of cutscenes, Max Payne uses comic panels to convey its more cinematic moments. After doing some research, I've found that this was due to both budget constraints (motion captured cutscenes are really expensive to animate) and because the technology used to create motion captured cutscenes on this scale was still relatively primitive at this time.\n\nDespite this, I actually prefer the comic panel approach as I feel it fits more with the noir aesthetic\n\n--{Audience}--\n🔳Kids\n☑️Teens\n☑️Adults\n\nAs you can imagine, with it being crammed full of murder, drug use, violence, government conspiracies, breaking the laws of physics, and occasionally poor grammar, viewer discretion is incredibly advised.\n\n--{Story}--\n🔳N/A\n🔳Poor\n🔳Average\n☑️Great\n🔳Genre-defining\n\nWithout spoiling anything, Max Payne's story is one of stereotypical revenge, but it does have a nice bit of nuance. Owning to the fact that Max's quest is two-pronged - he must clear his name and take down his enemies - the story doesn't just devolve into killing everyone in your way for no reason. At the start of the game, Max doesn't know who set him up or who he can trust. A large portion of the story is Max slowly piecing the puzzle together, gathering allies, and arming himself for the fight ahead. The overall pacing of the story is actually quite good, with the exception of the restaurant and ship yard levels. There's even some subtle hints to the deeper motivations of some of the antagonists if you look hard enough in some of the levels.\n\n--{Difficulity}--\n🔳Easy\n🔳Moderate Difficulty\n☑️Difficult\n🔳Very Difficult\n\nI label Max Payne as 'Difficult' mainly because of its tendency to - as I mentioned previously - place enemies in areas that the player couldn't possibly predict on their first time through a level. This either forces players to randomly take excessive amounts of damage, or constantly reload whenever they play through a challenging portion of a level. This problem is most pronounced in the final level of the game.\n\n--{Game Time}--\n🔳Very Short (~1 Hour)\n🔳Short (2 - 4 Hours)\n☑️Average (5 - 10 Hours)\n🔳Long (11 - 50 Hours)\n\nA single playthrough of Max Payne, on the normal difficulty will last you about 9 - 10 hours of playtime. Harder difficulties, which can be unlocked after completely the normal difficulty will likely take longer.\n\n--{Price}--\n☑️Worth the price\n🔳Wait for sale\n🔳Not recommended\n\nConsidering the enjoyment that I had with Max Payne, the ease of use of its controls, and the engagement of its story, I would say that it is well worth the price of admission at $9.99.\n\n--{Bugs/Glitches}--\n🔳Never had any\n🔳Minor bugs/glitches\n☑️Fair amount bugs/glitches\n🔳Ruins the game\n\nThis is likely going to be the most negative part of this review. As you can imagine, being a game released in the early 2000s with no modern patches, the game doesn't always play well with modern PCs. While there were very few small, annoying bugs, there were several large extremely annoying bugs. On Windows 10, 90% of the comic panels lack narration. In-game cinematics sometimes freeze-up, causing unavoidable deaths. The game lacks a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. Certain audio assets simply don't work. The game doesn't run on Ryzen CPUs (I don't own a Ryzen CPU but have been told by others that do that this is the case).\n\nCan you still run Max Payne and enjoy it? Yes, but you will occasionally need to bear with it.\n\n--{Conclusion}--\n\nMax Payne, even almost twenty years after its initial release still stands up as an absolute classic alongside the other great First Person Shooters of its time like Doom, Halo, or Half-life. While Max Payne doesn't hold together quite as well from a technical perspective, from a gameplay one it's clear to see how it influenced the gaming industry with its innovations. Max Payne's story is one of loss and revenge, but still offers enough nuance and twists to keep things interesting. I would highly recommend giving it a go.\n\n--{?/10}--\n🔳1\n🔳2\n🔳3\n🔳4\n🔳5\n🔳6\n🔳7\n☑️8\n🔳9\n🔳10\n\nThank you for reading my review.","timestamp_created":1610235279,"timestamp_updated":1610235279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46Y7g9PYCe7X3wQI="}
