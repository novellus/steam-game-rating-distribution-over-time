    review: 'The map is a jpg screenshot with all the table elements labeled. There
      is also an additional map (same pic) without the labels. The e-book is a 62
      page pdf which shows past games by the dev (mostly unfinished prototypes) that
      led the way to Demon''s Tilt pinball. Bigest part is the section about Demon''s
      Tilt, with lot''s of pic from the different states of development. It shows
      very nice how the different elements developed over time (graphics, table layout
      etc.) There are also developing notes, pics of unused assets, notes to the voice
      actress etc.


      I find it''s worth the extra money and nice to have. I did not expect much when
      I bought the dlc, just to give some support. But I was positively surprised
      about it.


      ...And  you get the soundtrack, which makes this already worth only because
      of this.'
