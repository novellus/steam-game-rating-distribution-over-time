There’s some that I didn’t think would really be involved, and those are the ones that love it the most. The first thing you see when they start playing is a big smile, and it’s amazing to see some of my non-verbal people open up and shine. It’s honestly like magic, and the smile - they can just go on and on and on and on. It is absolutely amazing! One additional great benefit I see is that it surprised many of them that they can do it.  A lot of times they’ve been told what they can’t do, but this interactive music experience makes them feel like they can do anything.  For the short time that they’re doing it, they feel like they have no limitations to what they can do.  The experience is a 10 out of 10, but honestly, it’s priceless.  It really is.  I’ve seen my group open up and smile and shine - there’s no number you can give it, it’s just priceless.”  said  GLORIA Quinn, Assistant Program Manager, Bethany Ranch Home.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>The Jam Studio VR Education &amp; Health Care Enterprise Edition (the “App”) provides a broad range of interactive educational, physical, and therapeutic songs, games, exercises, experiences, and benefits for use with family, friends, schools, teachers, special needs organizations and programs, therapy and rehab facilities, therapist, and other professionals.

Having this at the end of our week is a really juicy carrot that encourages our students to push through and really grow and develop because they love it.  This is a highly motivating, engaging activity for them.  For our students who often have fine and gross motor challenges, spatial awareness challenges, significant sensory challenges, and impulsivity challenges – this VR App and the process of having them wait in line brings their vestibular and other senses into play in order to engage and has been outstanding. It’s a highly discreet way to address all of those deficits for them in a way that they’re working harder than they probably would just to have the opportunity to do that.  Matt Drowne, Head of Gateway Academy”<br \/>\r\nGateway Academy<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n““As a neurologist and research scientist, I support that the possibilities within the Beamz technology are limitless for individuals of all ages. From children with developmental disabilities to those facing serious life-threatening illnesses, Beamz makes perfect sense. For children and adults in rehabilitation, Beamz has extraordinary potential to facilitate and accelerate ongoing progress. In the context of senior care, Beamz can help older people discover renewed confidence, meaning and value through the joy of recreational music making.”  -Barry Bittman, MD – President &amp; CEO”<br \/>\r\nYamaha Music and Wellness Institute<br \/>\r\n","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/947490\/header.jpg?t=1590177399","website":"http:\/\/www.jamstudiovr.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 SP1 or newer<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 equivalent or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX970, or AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 4 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Beamz Interactive, Inc.
