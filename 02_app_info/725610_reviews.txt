What a marvelously mechanical idea!\n\nWith this program, however... well, it's certainly works OK when fooling around but I found myself hate it after a very short time. First of all, there isn't a single UI element or options to alter the overall volume. In an audio application? Really? That's quite pathetic to be honest. Secondly, it goes for the \"has to look good and simple on screenshots\" route and puts EVERYTHING into context menus in pie shape rather than providing something more accessible. It's fiddly, unintuitive and the iconography doesn't help either. Changing gear speed and segment count for example is something you'll do quite often to put beats down but it's already a doubly nested sub menu for every single gear you're trying to touch.\n\nIt would've been a lot easier to e.g. involve the mouse wheel while hovering over an entry or just provide some widgets when hovering over the wheel itself. But nay, one has to menu dive for the sake of marketing. Same goes for muting/soloing wheels, changing their size etc. It's a mess. There's also a lot of other bits to nit-pick over like the sample browser containing a crap-ton of builtin stuff until you get to your own samples, the horrible performance when hovering over UI etc... all fine if the basic experience were to work in the first place.\n\nThus: No, I can't recommend any of what foreverloops is in the current state. You'd be better off with a couple old Lego gears, bells and a motor!","timestamp_created":1606496182,"timestamp_updated":1606502442,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwbzAhfYCc8neswI="}
