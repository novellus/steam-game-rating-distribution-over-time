    review: I think this game almost perfectly exemplifies what a bad indie horror
      game is - tedious game play consists mainly of key hunting and meaningless mazes,
      overused assets and texture pack, unnecessarily long loading screens, bad visibility,
      and a plot that makes absolutely zero sense.
