This model responds exactly the same as its real-life counter-part. The cockpit is very detailed and accurate - the only thing it is missing from my trainer is an avionics switch. This model, along with the purchase of rudder pedals has helped me get more out of every flight lesson and has probably saved me a few hundred dollars already.  Such a simple plane, but almost every pilot has flown one of these - so the pressue is on to get it right. They got it right. \n\n","timestamp_created":1506779836,"timestamp_updated":1506779836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5vXE6d4CdIrnhgE="}
