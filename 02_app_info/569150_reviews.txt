Travelling back in time to end up in a murder investigation that eventually leads to a surprisingly messed-up and bloody domestic feud… well, that takes it several steps beyond expected levels. \n\nDark Cases: The Blood Ruby has more than just this memorable plot—or similarly memorable beautiful artwork, for that matter. It is a roughly three-hour joyride with some pacing bumps and a few outlandish elements, elevating its murder mystery far above similar casual detective stories.\n\nAdmittedly, the game relies on these elements to keep the players invested, because it is a bit too keen on relying on classic adventure game methods, including a perpetually overcrowded inventory. The hidden object scenes are great, but too few to turn The Blood Ruby into the truly unforgettable HOG masterpiece its story would deserve.","timestamp_created":1549023609,"timestamp_updated":1549023609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.725614666938781738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ipDA1OgCcdDduQE="}
