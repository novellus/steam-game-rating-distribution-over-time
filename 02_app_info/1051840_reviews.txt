Kinda claustrophobic, but fun. After the first half it forgets it billed itself as a metroidvania and stops giving you new toys, and instead pummels you relentlessly with enemies that explode on death and are too close to you to avoid the damage, enemies that appear around corners, little to no healing, and (most damningly) a total abandonment of the old level design that bears nothing in resemblance to the first half. Get it on sale if you have to get it at all.","timestamp_created":1609022752,"timestamp_updated":1609022752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609097816,"developer_response":"I have heard from some players that the second part was not as enjoyable as the first, but none have been able to express why with such clarity.\n\nI really appreciate this feedback.\n\nI do want to clarify that there are upgrades to weapons and health in the later \"cave\" and \"factory\" maps, but you are right, they are not really new toys, just improvements on existing ones.    \n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific ideas to improve the level design of the later levels.  I felt they should be more difficult, and there are a number of hidden health upgrades, but perhaps they are too well hidden?  Maybe the enemies that shoot rockets should only do so in hard mode ... or adding a couple more powerful weapons ... just thinking out loud.  \n\nIn any case, I will think about revisiting those later levels, so future players can enjoy the whole experience.  Thanks again for this, sorry it did not meet your expectations.\n\n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJw0NjO0PYCc+TFvQI="}
