Made in only 7 Sleepless Nights. The Dread X Collection is a series of small games created by some of the most talented indie devs around, all with the same mission: create the P.T. for the horror project of their dreams.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong><br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“With gameplay experiences for nearly every type of horror gamer’s tastes, the DREAD X COLLECTION is an important and neoteric take on what indies and their gifted creators are capable of executing, especially on such a tight schedule. Limited to just a few key components, it’s proof that it doesn’t take large teams and inflated budgets to provide singular interpretations of what it means to feel truly afraid behind a keyboard or controller.”<br>4.5\/5 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.rue-morgue.com\/game-review-feel-good-about-feeling-bad-with-dread-x-collection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Rue Morgue<\/a><br><br>“For the $7 price of admission, Dread X Collection provides a breadth of different experiences, each having a distinct vision from its respective creator. If you’ve enjoyed previous games from any of the developers involved, this collection is well worth your time. Even if you haven’t, this release introduces many new creators you should probably be aware of. Finishing all the unique horror games here will likely take you around 10-15 hours, which ensures you get more than your money’s worth. This collection just further proves something I’ve known for a long time; you don’t need huge teams with massive budgets to create the types of horror games that make you feel a palpable sense of fear from behind a controller. Dread X Collection is a title that indie horror fans will not want to miss.”<br>8.5\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.relyonhorror.com\/reviews\/review-dread-x-collection-ten-tales-of-unique-indie-horror\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Rely On Horror<\/a><br><br>“Publisher Dread X brought us an original and compelling horror gaming anthology that makes sense both for its individual efforts as well as for the sum of its parts.
