    about_the_game: 'Have you ever wanted an extra gun to shoot down the enemies coming
      at you? A way to finish off the boss twice as fast? Or to cover twice as much
      of the screen in bullets? Then this game is made for you. But beware, because
      having twice the firepower also means having twice as many ways to get hit.<br><br>Two
      by One is a Shoot''Em Up that tasks you with controlling two ships simultaneously
      in order to progress. Enemies that would be invincible with a single ship become
      beatable with two. Threats that''d fill the screen with bullets disappear before
      they can shoot a single one.<br>Yet at the same time you have twice as many
      ships to protect. A safe spot for one might not be safe for the other, and a
      hit on one means losing both of them.<br><br>Alternatively, you can also bring
      along a friend and share the load, controlling one ship each. Just make sure
      you aren''t making things even harder for each other.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>A challenge you haven''t faced before</strong>: Hardcore
      stages that aren''t just about beating them, but figuring out how to beat them.<br></li><li><strong>Death
