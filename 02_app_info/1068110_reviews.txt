Reminds me a bit of Towerfall with guns. The lack of maps becomes apparent almost immediately. There are about five maps in versus mode and they get repetitive really quickly. I feel like I've experienced all that the game has to offer in the versus mode after under an hour of gameplay. We had fun while we played though. Here's hoping for some content updates soon.","timestamp_created":1564595732,"timestamp_updated":1564595732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524320483207702637","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4ofLpOwCfoG/zwE="}
