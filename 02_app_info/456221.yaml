    review: "Dios mio, el DLC est\xE1 roto. \xA1A la hoguera!\n\n\xBFC\xF3mo se arregla?\n\
      \nDesde Steam en configuraci\xF3n. Hay que ponerlo en versi\xF3n inglesa y al\
      \ hacer esto el DLC se actualiza a la ultima versi\xF3n ya parcheada.\n\nDe\
      \ nada.\n\nEl DLC es bastante bueno, a la altura del juego base y el de piratas.\
      \ Lucen bastante bien los escenarios, buena m\xFAsica y la historia y misiones\
      \ est\xE1n bastante bien desarrolladas. Parece que se pusieron las pilas.\n\n\
      Ya lo termine todo, no est\xE1 nada mal pero he de decir que encontre bugs a\
      \ cascoporro y estuve bastante desorientado con el lio de misiones, algunas\
      \ bugean al azar y la guinda me la pusieron al final con las seeing stones de\
      \ Laginu, tenia las tres en el inventario ya que las coges de x cofres sin saber\
      \ para que son y al empezar la cadena de misiones y pedirme la primera cogio\
      \ las tres del inventario y ahora me pide la segunda sin poder continuar, a\
      \ cargar una partida anterior y cogerlas quest por quest.\n\nY ahora un chiste:\n\
      Shattered Embrace V 2.07.3 is available now. (February 12th 2020)"
