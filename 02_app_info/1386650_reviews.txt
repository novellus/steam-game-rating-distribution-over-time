I hope it will get alot more polished, get more content and more customization with new outfits and skins. Also hope it gets more players to randomly play with because biggest issue for me right now is to find people to play with.\n\nI had a ton of fun so far so i will recommend it, if you can co-op play with random people online or with friends.","timestamp_created":1608419064,"timestamp_updated":1609787806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580948412418365479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608521118,"developer_response":"Thank you very much, please contact us if you have some suggestions."}],"cursor":"AoJwk5K15/YCcNXGuwI="}
