      Hunt down six classes of hidden ships: Aircraft Carrier, Amphibious Assault,\

      \ an early version, but it already fun to play. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.\
      \ Please tell me (fredsa@gmail.com) what you like and don't like about the game,\

    review: "very basic but fun none the less, woud be nice to have a screen centre\
      \ function as the grids were behind me so I had to turn my couch around for\
      \ seated gameplay.\nwould love to see a multiplayer mode added down the track.\n\
      for a free game it's a nice relaxing change from shooting zombies, vive controls\
      \ are very accurate and it runs smoothly.\nlooking forward to more updates,\
      \ keep up the good work. This is a great entry-level experience for new VR HTC\
      \ VIVE users. After running down the usual intro pieces like The Lab and Trials\
      \ on Tatooine, you'll want to show someone who may have gotten a little overwhelmed\
      \ this one. It's relatable and simple. In its own right, it is excellent. One\
      \ of my favourite experiences on the VIVE yet. No frills, just fun. pretty fun,\
      \ but it could use some polishing. The graphics and effects are meh\ndoes exactly\
      \ what you expect it to - and does it well.\nExcellent work! \n6/10 and worth\
      \ $2-3 BUT it's currently FREE!!!"
