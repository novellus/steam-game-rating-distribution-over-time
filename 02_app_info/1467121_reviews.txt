Unfortunately, the Russians didn't see it the same way. Imported through Murmansk and used to defend that port, they were seen as, too heavy, too slow and with a weak armament, unsuitable to be used as fighters, but they had no choice and eventually nearly 3000 were received, to be used to defend Moscow and Stalingrad.\nIf you want them for use in the RAF, you might be disappointed, as they don't fit any time frame, so only Quick Missions, are available.\nI'm using it in Career mode B o Moscow, where you get the 12 x .303 version with over 4000 rounds. I'm peppering 109's with it, (don't forget to disable boost limiter in combat),  but when you run out of ammo, it turns round and chases you. Eeek, you can't run away! It works well against the 110, but the 109 F2/F4, is hard work. Don't use full power for too long or the engine will pack up.\n1 year later, In the B o Stalingrad career, the Russians have ditched the Brownings and replaced them with 2 x 20 mm and 2 x 12.7 mm guns. This means that when you hit a 109, ( G2 by this time), it falls to bits. The 109, is much faster, but you can turn inside, ( be very wary of blackouts). Work on your deflection shots.\nAs an RAF pilot once put it, \"Any competent Hurricane pilot can defeat a 109\".\nI've yet to try the 4 x 20 mm or 2 x 40mm Tin Opener versions, but the Hurri is superb and well recommended.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2316675513 \n..","timestamp_created":1607193688,"timestamp_updated":1607709960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587301552295684814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9OS+qfYCcezItwI="}
