      a thief was good for, think again. The masters of skulking and skullduggery
      are a force to be reckoned with. Is anyone or anything safe from a person who
      might be anywhere, anytime?<br><br>Learn the thief''s most closely guarded secrets
      in this devious accessory for the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.<br><br><strong>Product
      History</strong><br><br><strong>PHBR2: The Complete Thief''s Handbook (1989)</strong>
      follows in the tradition of the previously published Complete Fighter''s Handbook:
      These early supplements for 2nd edition AD&amp;D provide a desperately needed
      distinction for low-option character classes, introducing kits to help make
      mechanically similar characters much more distinct in flavor and play style.
      While the series runs into balance issues later in the run (The Complete Bard''s
      Handbook and the Complete Book of Elves being notable examples), these early
      PHBRs are generally excellent: solid mechanics, little if any power bloat, and
      some interesting ideas.<br><br><strong>Locking In Proficiencies. </strong>Before
      there were non-weapon proficiencies (first introduced in a similar form in the
      1st edition Oriental Adventures but largely ignored otherwise), there were &quot;secondary
      skills.&quot; What''s a secondary skill? Usually it was your pre-adventuring
      background. If you had been a blacksmith, you could perform blacksmith-related
      tasks, with no other rules or rolls required. By default rules in 2nd edition,
      AD&amp;D non-weapon proficiencies were optional. The PHBR series changed this.<br><br><i>Thief''s
      Handbook</i> contains 20 new proficiencies, from Alertness to Fast-Talking to
      Voice Mimicry. Some of these saw more play than others. You''d seldom need Boating
      in a dungeon, for instance, but Observation was pretty darn important. These
      new rules have the effect, intended or otherwise, of narrowing a hero''s competency.
      Previously any AD&amp;D hero could jump or lie or spot things. Once proficiencies
      were implemented, that task became more difficult for anyone who didn''t have
      the proficiency. Seldom-needed proficiencies like Rope Use become incredibly
      important on those occasions when you need to climb down a pit or tie up a villain,
      for instance.<br><br>Proficiencies in this book are categorized by the kit to
      which they applied. If you want a proficiency but it isn''t listed as available
      for your thief''s kit, you can gain it by spending a second proficiency slot.
      It''s worth arguing that although proficiencies have some flaws in their implementation
      (as they were highly ability-check based, a high strength made for a better
      blacksmith than a low strength and decades of experience), they pave the way
      for subsequent skill point systems that nowadays help define D&amp;D.<br><br><i>Kit
      and Caboodle. </i>Character kits help determine what sort of thief you''re playing.
      There are 18 new kits introduced here, from Acrobat (echoing 1st edition AD&amp;D''s
      thief-acrobat class) to Scout to Thug. You can specialize in thieving, ambushing,
      investigating, or (if you were a swashbuckler) swinging on ropes and talking
      in an outrageous French accent. This book also re-introduces the Assassin, a
      class that had been removed from 2nd edition AD&amp;D to improve its image;
      while the kit offers no chance to instantly kill a foe, it does grant specialization
      in the use of poisons.<br><br>Some 2nd edition kits are notorious for balancing
      mechanical benefits with roleplaying penalties, an approach that was not always
      successful, but there are very few problems in the kits within this particular
      book: Game balance is kept on a fairly even keel, with no egregious offenders.<br><br><strong>Guilds,
      Tools and Rules.</strong> Subsequent chapters provide rules and descriptions
      for thief aspects that don''t usually get much attention. Here, 36 pages are
      given over to the thieves'' guild, detailing the benefits of joining and the
      guild''s place in the campaign world. Another 17 pages cover tools - not just
      tools that are useful for opening locks, but also for improving any of the classic
      thief''s skills, such as grappling hooks for climbing walls and camouflaged
      clothing for hiding. &quot;The Joy of Sticks&quot; even goes into detail on
      blade poles, climbing poles, hooked poles, and mirror poles to look over walls.
      The chapter ends with a handful of thief-related magic items.<br><br><strong>Campaign
      Building.</strong> Guidelines give the DM advice on running an all-thief campaign,
      as well as suggestions on how to thwart thieves in a D&amp;D world. There is
      discussion of deceptions and cons, and rules for building better locks and using
      poison in the game. Overall, the latter half of the book gives a solid grounding
      in the thief''s place within the world, allowing a DM to model classic stories
      of thieves'' guilds in their game.<br><br><strong>A Steal. </strong>This book
      is a must-have for anyone playing 2nd edition AD&amp;D or who wants to see the
      origin of many of the thief-related rules within modern D&amp;D. It''s solidly
      written, well-balanced, and consistently useful.<br><br><strong>About the Creators.
