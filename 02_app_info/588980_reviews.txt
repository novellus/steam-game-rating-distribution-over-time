But at 50% sale of $2.49 USD or lower, I can give a tepid recommendation. So this is yet another VR roller coaster collection of rides (4). So what is good and what is bad?\n\nPositive:\n+ each ride has a unique environment and different feel\n+ the blood red planet looks pretty awesome\n+ different things going on during the ride (twists, turns, jumps, etc.)\n\nNeutral:\n+/- Music was okay\n+/- Each track is around 3 minutes long\n+/- graphics are mediocre\n\nNegative:\n- feel like you're gliding on the track versus actually on the track\n- there's no sound of your coaster moving on the track, most sounds in this game were not very good\n- no hands visible, no reason to use your motion controllers except to start the ride\n\n[b]Sale Price Rating 6/10 only buy if you're a fan of VR roller coasters[/b]","timestamp_created":1511492586,"timestamp_updated":1554017904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2Oyr6ekCdPyNjgE="}
