    review: 'A space dragon fighting agains chainsaws on rockets sound really cool
      but the execution is as bland as it gets.


      Movement is indeed fast and responsive but doesn''t feel like anything flying
      through space. It''s more like these old school 8-bit shooters from years ago.


      You collect random upgrades by killing bosses and these stay on your account
      forever. That sounds like a good thing, but that means meaningful upgrades are
      very far between and none of them really gives the player that much of an advantage
      either. All levels are basically the same: a few waves of suicidal enemies and
      a boss fight at the end, each level with increasing difficulty.


      Graphics, sound, music, everything is simple and it already looks a bit dated.
      Although the sound effects do have a good oomph to them.


      The UI is also very basic and has its issues. After switching from 4k to 1080p,
      the game can''t be switched back to a higher resolution because of how it shows
      all options: an unscrollable block of text that doesn''t fit on screen anymore.
      The game also crashes once in a while and support seems to be long gone.


      And don''t get fooled by the trailer on the store page. It requires hours on
      hours to get close to that level of upgrades.


      Quite bad.'
