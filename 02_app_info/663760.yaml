    about_the_game: "Outgun is a multiplayer capture the flag game, with minimalist\
      \ graphics in 2D top-view.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by classic shooters from\
      \ the 90s like Quake and Doom, Outgun was created as an open source game in\
      \ 2002 by Brazilian Fabiana Cecin (Spinal) and developed between 2003 and 2011\
      \ by Finnish Niko Ritari (Nix) and Jani Rivinoja (Huntta).<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nPlayers are divided into two teams, with the goal of stealing the enemy's\
      \ flag and bringing it to their base while protecting their own flag. The team\
      \ with the most captured flags wins the match. Its simplicity makes room for\
      \ fast-paced action and competitive team play, making Outgun have a strong fan\
      \ base even 18 years after its launch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game supports\
      \ dedicated servers, bots, spectator mode and replays, as well as graphic and\
      \ sound themes created by players."
