But the reason why I can't recommend it, is that it's very buggy and unstable. \n\nYou have to keep saving your progress regularly because the program can crash at any moment. Certain functionality can become unavailable to your project because the program will crash if you try to apply it. You would have to start your project from scratch and hope it won't happen again.\n\nThe interface and use of the program are riddled with issues. Resizing the canvas pushes everything off screen so you have to relocate each and every element manually on every resize. Changing settings may or may not work, and may or may not override or undo other settings. You can export your animation as a sprite sheet and give it a filename, but exporting as a gif creates a file called result3.gif in the program's own directory instead. The interface was built for a specific size/ratio. Resizing the application window causing the interface to look messed up. Not to mention that resizing the application window also causes other bugs to appear.\n\nFor the price I expected something more professional and polished. Or at least stable.","timestamp_created":1609778131,"timestamp_updated":1609778131,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g56Q5/YCdYe4wAI="}
