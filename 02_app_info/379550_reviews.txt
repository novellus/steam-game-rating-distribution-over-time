Alright! Let me blow your mind with mine.\n\nI don't fly in and out of this airport often. I bought it because I'm basically getting rid of most default FSX airports and adding the add ons for a more realistic touch while simming. \nGraphics wise, I don't really see a drop in it, even while runnning payware things like the Majestic Dash8, REX textures, or the Feelthere Embraer Jets (Which you can also get on steam now.) \nOn the ground the airport looks nice as well. Approaching it is pretty with the mountain/volcano/oneofEarth'sbon3rs to the side of the airport. \n\nIs it worth what it's being sold for? Ehhhhh. Mostly yes. I say it would be nicer cheaper for most add ons but this one for sure. It's very nice, worth getting if you are willing to spend the money on it but not worth as much as it costs...so get it on sale if you want to fly in and out of it every now and then.","timestamp_created":1448602579,"timestamp_updated":1448602579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.67287367582321167","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g6bco9ECcNnQSQ=="}
