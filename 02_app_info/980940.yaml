    review: 'Welcome to shop keep 2 but blacksmith version as where the hell nutshell
      will arise, where you can see some buggy thing happening and pray to God that
      the dev don''t ditch this game like how the other developer ditch their game
      to developed another game for quick buck funding.  This game isn''t bad, it
      just minor game that doing it''s job trying be fun still funny hit NPC with
      a axe or either weapon that is a tool pretty much still laugh that they try
      run fast they could for felt like I am being the police from payday 2 with about
      the cloaker beating the snot out of players but now I am beating the snot out
      of NPC instead.  I still do it for my $##! and giggles if I get sick of tired
      selling stuff for I still go off beat the daylight out the NPC because it is
      funny and $##!.


      This bring conclusion is the game worth it?  To work your fusteration for good
      in some point of that good stress yes keep that mental mind good stress, and
      funny to hit npc who probably didn''t pay enough for you so basically give a
      wack or 2 for the fun of it.  Do not put hope and dreams into this game but
      there is up and down and when the game is buggy the colusion object item like
      a handle on top another handle may fling out like a cannon fired out for good
      gosh who know where it will landed for you''ll be struggling for days trying
      to look for it.  The game is still under work and has massive bugs but still
      funny watch the stuff being fired at the random as you see it bounce around
      your shop really dang fast.'
