    review: 'This game has now been in early access for almost five years. Plus, who
      knows how long this game has been abandoned for...?


      Picked it up for less than a dollar years ago, only reviewing it now before
      I file it away in a collection titled "GAMES TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN" and hide it
      from my library.


      Good things about this game? You can probably pick it up for less than a dollar
      every so often. And... it runs? Sort of?


      Bad things about this game...


      Well, play it and you''ll see. It''s not worth even what I paid for it, and
      you''re better off playing "Open World Game:  The Open World Game" -- those
      who''ve played that title will have experienced more content than is included
      in this game. Warriors & Castles has less to offer than most pre-alpha titles
      I''ve played.


      But if you really want to experience this... game? Yeah, game. Buy it, play
      it for fifteen minutes, then order a refund.'
