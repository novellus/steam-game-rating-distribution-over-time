It currently stands as my least favorite 2D platformer from any well-respected series, and I only finished Story Mode out of a sense of arbitrary, grueling obligation to finish what I paid for. I have a review of it written here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/qtqtqk/recommended/223220/\n\nBut at least I could run the game. Opening Rise of the Owlverlord past the initial launcher just gives me a fatal error regarding a memory manager, despite the fact that I could run the first game.\nMaybe I should contact the developer, but, honestly, I don't care enough about this series to, and I doubt Black Forest Games really cares enough to fix it either.","timestamp_created":1609647003,"timestamp_updated":1609647003,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ414Kc4/YCcY36vwI="}
