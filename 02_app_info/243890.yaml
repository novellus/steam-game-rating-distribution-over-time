    review: 'I bought this for my kids (8 and 11 years old). It''s broken down into
      intro drills (per key groupings), practice sessions and test. It gets the job
      done. What is sadly missing is the typing games from the version I had from
      20 years ago. I remember enjoying them way back then.


      There is nothing exciting about this, unless you enjoy grinding through the
      work and watching your speed and accuracy increase or drop. As someone who''s
      typed most of my life (and I''m one of those Gen Xer''s who took typing in high
      school with a manual typewriter) there is a good progression of groupings, sentences
      and paragraphs for each key grouping you will be working on.


      If you do the work you will get faster. I''ve put in a few hours and I was able
      to bring back some speed and accuracy to my typing. My kids (who have to have
      higher scores each day to get access to playing fun stuff on Steam) have been
      improving. So the software gets the job done.'
