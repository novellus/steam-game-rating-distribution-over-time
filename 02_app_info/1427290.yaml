    review: "This game is.... interesting. I'm tempted to refund it, but for now I\
      \ guess Ill keep it. I mean it is quite cheap.\n\nThe game is quite ugly. it\
      \ has some animations, but overall its not super pretty to look at. Considering\
      \ its genre, a roguelike-Roguelite mix (or so it claims) thats a perfectly alright\
      \ thing. I dont mind bad graphics if that means amazing gameplay!\n\n\nThe biggest\
      \ issue for me is a total lack of guidance. The game plops you into a random\
      \ part of town, with no gold and no items. Your mission is to kill the evil\
      \ guy. Basic stuff. Well, some doors wont open, others lead into empty buildings,\
      \ and the town itself has shopkeepers, a \"tip\" NPC, and soldiers. First I\
      \ did the tutorial, which is quite nice and adequately explains the base controls.\
      \ Thats it though- skills, how you get them, alchemy, and tons of other things\
      \ that you'll find in the world arent even described in the tutorial.\n\nAfter\
      \ that I started searching around. All I could find in town was a stool to fight\
      \ with. I died a few times trying to attack soldiers to steal their sword. I\
      \ then found a sewer, where I was insta-killed by a spider. I then left the\
      \ town to the south, and got murdered by 3 bandits. I then left the town to\
      \ the East, and again killed by 3 bandits. I talked to the tip guy- he said\
      \ find a stool to fight with and take your time exploring! YEA........ I was\
      \ pretty frustrated. I tried to talk to everyone- nothing helpful. The combat\
      \ trainers need money to train or require level 6? Didnt even know there was\
      \ a leveling system.....\n\nIn other words, so much of this game is left undescribed,\
      \ I feel like I cant play. Most roguelikes use this to their advantage- DCSS\
      \ forces you to relearn scrolls and potions every run, COQ has randomized weapons\
      \ and artifacts. Everytime you die you learn something new, and you as a player\
      \ get better. This game suffers from not explaining enough so I can actually\
      \ start learning.\n\nBUT..... I've saved the worst for last. COMBAT. Jesus christ.\
      \ This game is absolutely not a roguelike. The combat is real time, set in a\
      \ grid, and just feels awful. Its like a rythym game without music- instead\
      \ you get feet noises. Listen to the trailer with the sound on, thats what you\
      \ hear all game. yea. well the combat is not strategic or smart or tactical.\
      \ essentially, you sit still as a creature approaches, then hit space bar right\
      \ as they are in front of you to damage. If you arent fast enough they hit you,\
      \ and too early theyll hit you. So you have to time it just right..... did I\
      \ mention you can only survive two hits? combat against multiple enemies is\
      \ impossible. Its terrible. \n\nIf you feel like ambling around trying to dechiper\
      \ this game, be my guest. I hope it gets wildly better over time, but seeing\
      \ as its not early access I doubt it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, this\
      \ does feel like someones personal project and I can tell someone really put\
      \ in some serious effort into this game. Its by no means in any way perfect,\
      \ but its more of a game then I'd ever be able to make! With some tuning and\
      \ overhaul I'm sure this could be a great game, but as of now it is not."
