Still, the atmosphere is very good here, I really liked how the wind picked up sand outside and the general feeling of isolation is well done. My issue is that it is a FNAF like and though I enjoy that on occasion, its not one of my preferred styles of game.\n\nSo, thumbs up for atmosphere and that it didnt crash on me : D","timestamp_created":1606900660,"timestamp_updated":1606900660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8savkfYCccbbtgI="}
