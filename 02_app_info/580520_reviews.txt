And that makes it intriguing, even though its weak and shallow environment design. Its genre and level of details reminds me of 'Soul Axiom Rebooted' as nearly same apart from less uniform but more dense puzzles.\n\nStorywise, it tries to tell something about humanity and its future, faking like it hides some secrets behind its story, something beyond, something meta. Probably, I won't get that, or that's just a fake feeling, the game didn't hook me of that enough.\n\nExploring in a strange planet, listening to some psychedelic songs, considering there is a mystery to follow, all of them together makes the experience pleasant to some extent.\n\nIt has so many positive reviews. I think it is just because of its musics. There are better and much more complete VR walking sims like 'Journey For Elysium', 'Unknown Fate' and 'Soul Axiom Rebooted' that deserves that possitive review rate more.\n\nIf you played and liked this, I recommend 'XING: The Land Beyond' and 'MIND: Path to Thalamus' as well. And lastly for non-vr only gameplay, 'Aporia: Beyond The Valley'. These are almost incomparable with their epic scenery.","timestamp_created":1604613140,"timestamp_updated":1604613922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzauczfUCcv/GrAI="}
