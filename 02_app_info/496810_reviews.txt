The story is interesting, but kind of bland. The battles are fairly straight forward as long as you stay on the move. The controls feel a little off. I don't know how to describe it, but i was constantly forgetting what button did what. It was fun to see the CPUs and candidates in a school setting.\nI have had [spoiler]Neptune[/spoiler]x[spoiler]Uni[/spoiler] as head cannon for so long, that I almost missed the actual ship in the game. Wish it was canon. lol\nThe multiplayer is dead, but I kind of expected that. I've only met like three other players ever, and one of them disconnected instantly because he forgot to set a password that wasn't \"1234\".","timestamp_created":1609788829,"timestamp_updated":1609788829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41IW55/YCfoy+wAI="}
