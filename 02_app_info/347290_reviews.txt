It is very bad. It has beautiful art but that is the extent of its good qualities and it doesn't even redeem it.\n\nYou'd think, with a title like Rise & Shine, which refers to the names of the two characters, which come together to make for a catchy saying that makes for a good title, that this would be a light-hearted and enjoyable romp with the cartoonish visuals and colours. No; this is a very serious story about war and the horrors therein. While I believe contrary to popular belief that cartoonish visuals and bright colours can indeed tell a grim and serious war story, that depends on the story being good. [u]Rise & Shine[/u]'s story is dreadful. It's disgraceful. I thought [u]Hyperdimension Neptunia[/u] was as bad as game-as-a-world setting stories could get but this takes it to a whole new level.\n\nThe game starts in medias res with Rise crying in the middle of a war torn city. A fellow Gamearthian is killed next to him, then a giant robot approaches Rise with killing intent. \"How did we get here?\" you might ask, and the game will oblige with a flashback sequence taking us to the beginning of the game... which is a mall falling under attack with death and destruction on all sides. Effectively, nothing is different. One might reasonably wonder why we even started the game at such a place, considering the actual beginning is already war-torn chaos. I assure you, dear reader, that this is far from the only thing that warrants an explanation and provides none.\n\nSecondly is Rise's partner, Shine, a talking gun. Rise comes across in the actual beginning the Legendary Hero, who is about to die from his wounds. He gives Shine to Rise, explaining that Shine is a legendary weapon who grants its bearer infinite respawns. Rise then asks why Shine can't just save the Legendary Hero from death. The Hero then goes \"Heh... You're a smart kid... That's because...\" And then he dies, not explaining this plot hole and colossal lapse in judgement.\n\nIn game, you have extremely limited health to the point you might as well die in one hit. Your mobility is also quite limited, so you are expected to die a lot. Rise brings this up in a lot of cutscenes, expressing the toll that dying and respawning has on him. So the game mechanics intersect with the story and protagonist's characterisation, which is a good idea that needed to be pulled off by a better written game than [u]Rise & Shine[/u] (which is very poorly written, just to remind you). \n\nBeing a game set in a world of video games, the game brings up a lot of \"meta\" jokes about video game mechanics and conventions. Some might call this self-awareness but it's not; it's awareness of other games. If [u]Rise & Shine[/u] was self-aware, it would be a vastly different game that wouldn't make this many stupid decisions, like the following plot development: other characters in the world, including the enemies, are aware of Shine granting Rise infinite respawns... so the invading enemy force dedicates its efforts to trying to kill you [i]despite the fact they know you'll only come back to life consequence-free![/i]. \n\nThere are also two points in the game where you have to die to proceed. In the first scenario, you're killed by a security sign on a hill, so your skull rolls down the hill and you respawn there ahead of the sign. Here's the problem: each other time you respawn, you end up back at a checkpoint with all your progress undone. So not only is this game really poorly written, there's no internal consistency.\n\nI got this game for 60% off and I still feel ripped off. Its brevity becomes a blessing as I don't have to put up with more of it, so I won't force you to suffer through more of this review. There are far better games out there for the price of this one so just get those instead.","timestamp_created":1608946065,"timestamp_updated":1608946065,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520833313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45pOqzvYCdNadvQI="}
