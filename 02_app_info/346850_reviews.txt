I PLAYED THIS GAME SO MUCH AS A KID!\n\nIdk how today's generation will feel about this game. For those of you who don't know this game. It is a very unique puzzle game. Developed long before game designers copied and pasted ideas from each other. The thing that's unique about this game is how the puzzles are designed. As you progress, the challenges become tougher. But it's a bit different from other puzzle games. It's never impossible to complete. But each challenge teaches you (real you. not game you.) so you can better handle the rest of the game. It's not too easy and its not too hard...well...if you play long enough to get to the harder levels, you won't need to take my word for it.","timestamp_created":1610028977,"timestamp_updated":1610028977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tpHN7vYCdJKkwQI="}
