    review: For the price it was a lot of fun. I bought it before I had a dedicated
      graphic card for me to play with my girlfriend and even if she had just played
      mario SNES versions she managed to play and have fun. It is good to spend some
      time and has the advantage of being playable with friends using the same computer.
      I would buy it on a sale.
