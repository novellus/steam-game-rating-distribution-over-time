    about_the_game: "What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from\
      \ flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds.\
      \ The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their\
      \ struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants\
      \ of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled\
      \ by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For\
      \ each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the\
      \ other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story / Background </h2>In the distant future,\
      \ the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences\
      \ called the Core (a contraction of &quot;Consciousness Repository&quot;). The\
      \ Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize\
      \ most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance\
      \ is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of\
      \ a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically\
      \ granting infinite life, in a process called &quot;patterning.&quot; Following\
      \ a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning\
      \ as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the\
      \ edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to\
      \ leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting 4,000\
      \ years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles\
      \ and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own\
      \ machines.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key information </h2>Total Annihilation (TA)\
      \ is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment\
      \ under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September\
      \ 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two\
      \ expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and\
      \ Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released,\
      \ the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16\
      \ MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern\
      \ day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still\
      \ recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game\
      \ engine.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game features </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Upon\
      \ release, the original TA game boasted:\t<li>Fully-articulated 3D units and\
      \ buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types \u2014 for example, aircraft,\
      \ amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines,\
      \ unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons.\
      \ A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies,\

      \ than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player\

      \ the infamous Krogoth), 50 new maps, 25 new missions, and 6 new world types.\
      \ Battle Tactics added 4 new units, 6 new maps, and 100 new missions. A final\
      \ patch (version 3.1c, and included here) added 6 new units, including a resurrection\

      \ initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous\
      \ planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation),\
      \ before a final strike on the enemy's home world: either on the Arm's bucolic\
      \ Empyrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission\
      \ objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal\
