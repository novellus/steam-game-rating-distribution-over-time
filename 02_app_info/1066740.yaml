      /><br>Use your skills and true faith to save the souls of innocent people. Lead
      investigations against heresies during which you will use many interrogation
      techniques such as whipping, breaking on the wheel, burning and many more! Listen
      to people, sometimes the rumors contain a grain of truth so can find the trail
      of real sinners. Every successful investigation improves your reputation among
      the people but is careful not to condemn innocent people to death because the
      people's favor is not permanent.<br><br>Main Features:<br>- Hundreds of different
      clues that can lead you to the mission's goal.<br>- Expand the headquarters
      of your inquisitor.<br>- Talk to citizens about their problems, listen to gossip.<br>-
      Lead the investigation yourself. <br>- You can be a clever detective who will
      solve the matter using the available clues... or a brutal torturer who uses
      torture to find out the truth.
