      \ Shibusawa Archives&quot; will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive\
      \ popular previously released titles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this ninth round\

      \ Up Kit,&quot; an expanded version of the 9th game in the series.<br />\r\n\
      \ RTK \u2168 is a strategy based simulation game based in China's chaotic Three\
      \ Kingdoms period. Players portray a Daimyo and lead their clan in an attempt\
      \ to unify the entire land of Japan. For the first time in the series, the game\
      \ uses a single large map and brings together battle and strategy in an entirely\
      \ new way. Players give their officers &quot;Strategies&quot; and those officers\
      \ work to carry them out in real-time. Players can also set up facilities and\
      \ obstacles on the battlefield to aid them. Officers can learn tactics and employ\
      \ them in a strategic battle like none before."
