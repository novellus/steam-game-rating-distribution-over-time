It plays and feels like it's been lifted straight out of 1987! The only real thing I have to say I'm not a fan of - and this may well be a personal gripe more than anything - is that you still have complete control over the heading of your car whilst in the air. It kinda makes the jumps seem a little pointless bar avoiding an obstacle or two.\n\nI also adore how you can buy alternative body types and then mix and match the front/middle/rear ends of ANY of your cars. You want an F1 car with a pick-up bed? You got it! You want a supermini with a humongous bonnet big enough for a 7-litre HEMI? Sure thing!\n\nAll in all, it's a fun little game and due to the non-existent loading screens and the short, 2-minute races, it's easily a game you can pick up and play especially when you have extremely limited time to play.","timestamp_created":1607047576,"timestamp_updated":1607047576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnP/flfYCd5ORtwI="}
