    review: '[i]Winter''s Trumpet[/i] is a charming and short point-and-click/visual
      novel hybrid with a retro design and a slightly creepy atmosphere. It takes
      place in the same world as [i]Asher[/i] and [i]Tell a Demon[/i], and players
      who love these games have absolutely nothing to lose by giving it a go: in fact,
      the events of [i]Winter''s Trumpet[/i] take place before those depicted in [i]Asher[/i],
      and the former gives us an interesting look at the motivations of several key
      characters of the series. For people who haven''t played the dev''s other games,
      beginning with [i]Winter''s Trumpet[/i] isn''t the best way to go, in my opinion,
      since it''s short and the story is a bit vague if you''re not already aware
      of what the main plotlines are.

      Apart from the writing, which is excellent as expected from Sun Labyrinth, I
      really enjoyed the character portraits and the soundtrack, which has some great
      moments: I would definitely buy it if the developer released it separately.'
