    review: "Firstly, I've been playing Everquest for 14 going on 15 years at this\
      \ point. The amount of hours that Steam has tracked don't do me any justice.\
      \ That being said, Everquest has some serious problems. There was a time when\
      \ I would have recommended the game and I have recommended the game. That time\
      \ is past.\n\nPros: \n- A good community. The community overall is full of nice\
      \ and helpful people. Yes, there is some people who definitely don't fit that\
      \ description but they are few and far between.\n\n- The game being modeled\
      \ after tabletop D&D. The fact that somebody can have a max level character\
      \ with all the best stuff in the game and still miss/have attacks dodged by\
      \ lower level mobs is hilarious. \n\nCons:\n- Servers. This has been a hot topic\
      \ lately on both the forums and in game. The last several months especially\
      \ there has been a ton of problems with servers crashing regularly and lagging.\
      \ Additionally, the other major problem server related is the fact that they\
      \ continue to create new servers when the game's population is relatively small.\
      \ With the introduction of progression servers a lot of guilds on the regular\
      \ servers have disappeared entirely which has also snowballed into people quitting\
      \ the game because the rest of their friends moved on to progression servers.\
      \ The developers of this game only seem to pay attention to the latest and greatest\
      \ progression servers while the regular servers suffer badly. I speak from experience\
      \ on this as my guild of 14 years went from about 40-50 regular raiders down\
      \ to about 3 other people online every now and then besides myself. Daybreak\
      \ has done an excellent job of destroying long established communities.\n\n\
      - Customer Service. Customer service since Daybreak took over for Sony has been\
      \ hit and miss at best. Where the GM's used to help you with everything no problem\
      \ now you sometimes get a GM that says \"sorry, just do it again.\" or \"sorry,\
      \ just wait for a fix.\"\n\n- Expansions. The expansions are a copy and paste\
      \ disaster of already existing content. The last 10 expansions have been primarily\
      \ copy and pasting of mobs while simply increasing the numbers (I.E. the mobs\
      \ levels and how hard they hit). This sadly applies to the raid content as well\
      \ as the vast majority of raid mobs have become humans or other playable races.\
      \ The imagination factor of creating beastly looking creatures to slay is gone\
      \ and dead.\n\n- Lack of communication. The developers don't have a whole lot\
      \ to say in regards to these issues. The only things they talk about for the\
      \ most part are their \"new\" progression servers where you have the ability\
      \ to start all over again. Additionally, when you add the game to Steam the\
      \ most recent news is from back in 2013 where they announce the launch of Call\
      \ of the Forsaken. They haven't had any news to add to steam in 4 years evidently.\
      \ (I guess The Darkened Sea, The Broken Mirror and Empires of Kunark weren't\
      \ news worthy expansions.)\n***EDIT: There's no doubt that the progression servers\
      \ are still very much EverQuest's \"baby\" but they have started posting news\
      \ to Steam once again.\n\n- Lag. If you play with any sort of graphics on the\
      \ game actually runs pretty badly. I got my computer sometime around 2012-2013\
      \ and play with all the newest models and spell graphics on (as you should be\
      \ able to do in any game, especially one as old as EQ). I use the Steam FPS\
      \ meter to monitor how well the game performs and in group content FPS ranges\
      \ anywhere from 15-60 with an average of about 25 FPS. On raids FPS will range\
      \ anywhere from 0 (the meter simply disappears)-15 FPS. To put things in perspective,\
      \ heres a list of my PC specs:\n[list]\n[*]Intel Core i7 3930k @ 3.20GHz\n[*]2x\
      \ NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660\n[*]32 GB RAM\n[/list]\n*EDIT: Since I listed these\
      \ PC specs I have since had one of 660's die. I upgraded to 1x NVIDIA GeForce\
      \ GTX 1070 and gained virtually nothing for doing so.  I notice maybe 1 more\
      \ FPS over my above mentions. (Benchmark: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/20295692?)*\n\
      **EDIT: Recently upgraded my entire computer. i7-6950X, 2x NVIDIA GeForce GTX\
      \ 1080 Ti and 131 GB RAM. Nothing has changed. I've never played a game that\
      \ runs so poorly. I would think given my PC's specs it would run so good I'd\
      \ have to turn on V-sync but that's not even close to the case. (Benchmark:\
      \ http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/20373384?)**\n\n- Graphics. The game still very\
      \ much looks like an old Playstation 1/Playstation 2 game. The graphics were\
      \ good for back when this game was created. Some of the graphics were even upgraded\
      \ to look better in 2001. However, there hasn't been any modernization improvements\
      \ since then. Games today like RIFT and Elder Scrolls Online are significantly\
      \ more pleasant to look at. Additionally, when you first enter a zone the game\
      \ has a tendency to zone you in before any of the textures load. That being\
      \ said the entire game world ends up looking like gray squares/rectangles and\
      \ nude character models until the textures catch up."
