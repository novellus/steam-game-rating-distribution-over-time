There is usually only one way to beat the level and it must be done exactly like that every time.  \n-Not a ton of content compared to Celeste, Super Meat Boy, The End is Nigh, etc.  \n\nThoughts:\n-I really enjoyed the game early on, but struggled late game.  Normally, I see myself improving as the game progresses which is really rewarding.  It's allows for more freedom and creativity in how I play.  I can usually notice a clear improvement in my control of the character over the course of the game.  I never really felt that way in this game.  I had a hard time adjusting to the movement and jumping.  I constantly slid off platforms and so I started compensating by pulling back at the last second which then lead to a lot of under-jumping. With saying all this, I think it's worth a try for any fans of the genre; you may find the controls are more intuitive than I personally did.\n\nConsensus:\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and make up 25% of reviewed games).  It's decent value at just $6, so I think it's an easy purchase during a sale for any platforming fan.","timestamp_created":1598329784,"timestamp_updated":1600885145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42peM3vQCeJ3OnQI="}
