You have to really concentrate, kinda like with chess.\nThe tutorial is good for learning the basics of the game, and I guess you have to just play against the ai to really practice.\nThe music is nice but I only use it when I start because I still have to concentrate on understanding the game.\nAll in all, would recommend.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1603541605,"timestamp_updated":1603541605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qOOhrfUCc+XnqQI="}
