There is no Squad Management in the Squad Management - DLC. \n\nSecond, the game is too short for the roleplaying aspect to matter. You can't bond with your platoons when there are only 9 missions in the game. \n\nIts... Just not good.. I wish it was better. If you're going to buy this game I would get this DLC. But hopefully the developer reads this and tries harder on the next game they make.\n\n*****Major Problem********\nHaving an entire platoon listed (randomly?) from #1 to #36 with absolutely no order of battle is just BAD. \n\nDevelopers. You need to organize these platoons into squads with Squad leaders / Machine Gunners / Pointmen etc etc etc...It should look like unit cards you can drag and drop into place into the squads from the replacement pool. That way soldiers upgrade and the platoon's effectiveness is directly affected by the manpower choices the player makes.\n\nI just wish this was better. I'm opening up the game after beating it wanting to play more.. But theres nothing else to do..\n\n","timestamp_created":1604482383,"timestamp_updated":1604482383,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624356269836425781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ycemyfUCeLubrAI="}
