There are better/easier ways to play the song. The only one that comes close to the original tabs is 40:1. In Primo Victoria e.g. the chart only tells you to play single notes in the verses where power chords sound way better and closer to the original. And in Ghost Division you can play the whole riff on the E/A strings instead of A/D which is way easier and more comfortable, at least for me.","timestamp_created":1588712006,"timestamp_updated":1588712006,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538207828998565674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl6yn8/ECeqTqhQI="}
