    reviews: "\u201CWith gameplay experiences for nearly every type of horror gamer\u2019\
      s tastes, the DREAD X COLLECTION is an important and neoteric take on what indies\
      \ and their gifted creators are capable of executing, especially on such a tight\
      \ schedule. Limited to just a few key components, it\u2019s proof that it doesn\u2019\
      t take large teams and inflated budgets to provide singular interpretations\
      \ of what it means to feel truly afraid behind a keyboard or controller.\u201D\
      <br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.rue-morgue.com/game-review-feel-good-about-feeling-bad-with-dread-x-collection/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Rue Morgue</a><br><br>\u201CFor the $7\
      \ price of admission, Dread X Collection provides a breadth of different experiences,\
      \ each having a distinct vision from its respective creator. If you\u2019ve\
      \ enjoyed previous games from any of the developers involved, this collection\
      \ is well worth your time. Even if you haven\u2019t, this release introduces\
      \ many new creators you should probably be aware of. Finishing all the unique\
      \ horror games here will likely take you around 10-15 hours, which ensures you\
      \ get more than your money\u2019s worth. This collection just further proves\
      \ something I\u2019ve known for a long time; you don\u2019t need huge teams\
      \ with massive budgets to create the types of horror games that make you feel\
      \ a palpable sense of fear from behind a controller. Dread X Collection is a\
      \ title that indie horror fans will not want to miss.\u201D<br>8.5/10 \u2013\

      \ Dread X brought us an original and compelling horror gaming anthology that\
      \ makes sense both for its individual efforts as well as for the sum of its\
      \ parts. It works so well for its variety, above all, being a showcase of the\
      \ horror possibilities that video games can offer as an artistic expression.\
      \ A window to a world so big and so small, at the same time, that feels as good\
      \ as it is terrifying.\u201D<br>8.5/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.shdownloads.com.ar/2020/05/analisis-dread-x-collection-antologia-terror.html\"\

    review: 'Interesting concept, bundling together some quickly-made indie horror
      demos to see what sticks. I recommend this, as long as you have an open mind.
      But if you''re curious on what I''d rank these demos, well here you go:


      [h1] [b] 10. Rotgut [/b] [/h1]

      Super glitchy (my friend fell through the map and the game said he won) with
      horrendous texture issues, with practically nothing going on. Even the achievement
      didn''t know what to say for this "accomplishment".


      [h1] [b] 9. Don''t Go Out [/b] [/h1]

      Very RNG-reliant, this turned-based survival/card game could have been more.
      With a great NES style, this had everything going for it, but unfortunately
      it simply doesn''t have much to offer.


      [h1] [b] 8. Summer Night [/b] [/h1]

      Little arcade game that has a slowly depleting battery that causes shenanigans
      to ensue. I don''t know why everybody hypes this one up, it was alright, even
      after the batteries died.


      [h1] [b] 7. The Pay Is Nice [/b] [/h1]

      Cool story, but feels way too short (admittedly, they did only have 7 days to
      make this). Love the sound design here.


      [h1] [b] 6. Outsiders [/b] [/h1]

      Cool gameplay loop and concept, just a bit frustrating to navigate the field
      though. Very polished and the way the house progressively deteriorates every
      run is great.


      [h1] [b] 5. Hand of Doom [/b] [/h1]

      Very short but charming game. Story is nothing to be impressed by, but I loved
      the ES: Arena/Daggerfall style.


      [h1] [b] 4. Carthanc [/b] [/h1]

      LOVED the aesthetics in this, but the gameplay is really clunky, and a bit frustrating
      at first. Also, everything is extremely loud for no reason. Concept is cool
      enough.


      [h1] [b] 3. Shatter [/b] [/h1]

      Great world-building present here, and I love the PSX style. Would love to see
      more from this, if the developers ever decide to continue.


      [h1] [b] 2. The Pony Factory [/b] [/h1]

      From the developer of DUSK (and recently Squirrel Stapler), you should already
      know this one''ll be good. Polished shooting mechanics and a great atmosphere,
      as well as some genuinely disturbing enemy designs, this is one of my favorites
      demos in this collections. Story felt a bit cheesy though (but what can I say,
      it''s a game called "pony factory").


      [h1] [b] 1. Mr. Bucket Told Me To [/b] [/h1]

      I don''t know why I loved this as much as I did. Maybe it was the charming writing,
      the surprisingly pleasing visual style, or the polished survival mechanics (hunger,
      hydration, cleanliness, excrement, and stamina), but for the little time these
      developers had, they made a very polished and very fun game, one that I would
      love a follow-up to.'
