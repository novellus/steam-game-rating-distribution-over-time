I thought: Oh well, If I want to play contraption maker at all, I need this.\n\nActually, this DLC adds a new dimension to the game. A second \"plane\" where you can only place wonderstruct parts. Whatever is on the second plane does not collide with the first and default plane, so you can imagine them as running in parallel. The only way to move parts from one to another, is via special s-bend pipes that has one end in one layer, and one in the other. Wonderstruct parts can still be placed on your default plane, so no need to worry. What IS worrysome, is the fact that this applies only to the parts added by the DLC. If a non-dlc part tries to go through the plane s-bend pipe, it simply does not switch, which can lead to interesting \"sorting\" intersections where you can just make all wonderstruct marbles go down one path, and everything else on another.\n\nAnother fun mechanism is the \"wonderstruct switch\" which is simply an intersection that switches itself as marbles go through. Every second marble goes onto an alternative route. There is a puzzle involving only this mechanism, where you have to set the switches up, so that the balls sort out between two baskets.\n\nHowever, there are only a few puzzles and none of them is really challenging. They merely introduce the mechansims.\n\nIn my opinion, this DLC is a must-own for anyone and it really adds something refreshing to Contraption Maker unlike those free updates.","timestamp_created":1516045501,"timestamp_updated":1516045501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pNDW/eACcI6ZlgE="}
