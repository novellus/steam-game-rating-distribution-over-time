    review: 'The game comes out as a Lovecraftian horror game with stealth and platforming
      game.

      It is in early developlent stages but It has huge potential to evolve into an
      amazing game. It has a noir taste all around but with Lovecraftian touches


      Developers seem to care for the opinion of the players too so it feels like
      we  could have a great Lovecraftian game if they managed to pull it .'
