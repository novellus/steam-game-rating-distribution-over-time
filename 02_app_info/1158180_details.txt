Snikch also has the Vanguard Deployment and Stalk abilities, further cementing his role as the foremost Master Assassin of the Skaven.<br><br><strong>Master Assassin (Lord)<\/strong><br><br>Following in Snikch’s example, the Master Assassin excels at battling opposition characters in close combat but can also rely on their ranged shuriken attack to take enemies out from a distance.
