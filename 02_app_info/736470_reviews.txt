It features one big city you explore on foot and bike, hunting the mentioned godbeasts and their masters. The combat is budget Dark Souls, very similar to the dev's previous game Malebolgia but somewhat faster and smoother. Godbeasts first need to be found with the help of your spear (halberd? harpoon?) and then harpooned so you can climb on them Shadow of the Colossus style. Killing the godbeast allows its master to be defeated in combat. Kill all the persons on the list and you're done.\n\nI feel like I have to compare it to Malebolgia; this game feels less polished, but more daring. The textureless style is really pleasing on the eyes, but it can be a nightmare to navigate through forests or featureless halls, frequently losing yourself in the same shades of blue and gray. The lock-on camera in combat with lesser mobs and human bosses is very wonky and can be annoying. It's never centred on the screen and you have to manually readjust the camera regardless of lock-on. There's also a distinct lack of sound effects during combat, you don't feel like you're hitting something. There is also texture and model flickering at times, and cutscenes are incredibly basic with no voice acting and static models.\n\nAll that said, the actual design of the city and the enemies do have a sense of direction. The city is fairly large, but you get the bike quite soon and distance isn't really an issue. It has a logical looping highway and as soon as you memorise the layout you'll do fine. There's also a fast travel system that's somewhat annoying to use, but it's there. The map is not really useful, however. The bike is probably the coolest thing about the game; you can summon it at will and zip through the city, even attacking from it and jumping on mobs from it. The city is largely empty space, but you can find statues with hidden lore and bonus matches with beefed up normal enemies to upgrade your stats such as health and stamina. Each godbeast is modeled after a different animal and behaves slightly differently. One of them has a neat gimmick to lure it in before you can harpoon it. All of them need to be harpooned and then climbed upon to strike at their weak points, and it's the most exciting part of the game by far. The human bosses are more standard Souls fare, but still function well enough.\n\nThere are several neat touches that I wouldn't want to spoil, so if any of this seems appealing to you, I'd say go for it. It's only 3 hours long, more or less, try it out.\n\n","timestamp_created":1598365741,"timestamp_updated":1598365741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537572264671325684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/LWBk/QCfoPYnQI="}
