I bought this years ago but never played until this review was made. Kitten Rampage wasn't the worst game out there but is it good? No, definitely not. This game belongs somewhere else and that is with the terrible meme games that you would find when you keep scrolling down in the App Store. It was made five years ago but should've been created another five years before it. These types of games should never be on Steam and shouldn't cost $8.","timestamp_created":1608596999,"timestamp_updated":1609882014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk8Kc6vYCd4OIvAI="}
