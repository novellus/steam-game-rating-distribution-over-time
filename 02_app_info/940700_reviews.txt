I like the atmosphere with the music and the level design. Its a nice mix of throwing discs and solving puzzles with the disk. The disc physics work really well. At first I thought it would be too easy, but along the way, new objectives are added. For example you have to shoot enemies with the disk or use the shield to solve the puzzles.","timestamp_created":1545411744,"timestamp_updated":1545411744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkPrt6OcCfunytQE="}
