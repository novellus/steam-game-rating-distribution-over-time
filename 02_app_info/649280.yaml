    review: "This DLC adds twelve more bounties, each stronger than the last, with\
      \ the last three locked behind the preceding ones - you have to fight the first\
      \ 9 of the Deadly Dozen (in any order) for no. 10 to show up, and then fight\
      \ him for 11 to show up... you get the idea. \n\nThe bounties themselves are\
      \ nice and fun, for the most part. There is a sudden spike of difficulty - I\
      \ noticed it around Ivy Bloom and had to change my approach for Nikita - that\
      \ marks a focus away from engaging bounty targets individually towards attacking\
      \ them with warfleets in tow. You WILL need Warfleets for the last two, because\
      \ they have millions of HP. I have emptied the magazines of a Tzar class carrier\
      \ at them and still had to wait several minutes for my turrets and the 70k+\
      \ fleet to pound them down into oblivion. I suppose you could call it a hard\
      \ fight, but I actually liked the challenging individual opponents of the first\
      \ nine bounties more. \n\nYour reward for going through all this is a VERY nice\
      \ ship, the Deadly Perun, and potentially getting the blueprints to it, enabling\
      \ you to use it for your fleets (better fleet point value for supercapital point\
      \ than any other carrier, or dreadnaught for that matter. Not a HUGE difference,\
      \ but nice). Supposedly there might be a warmaster involved in the other option,\
      \ but I can't confirm this and can't really seeing it play out that way, story-wise.\
      \ It seems more of a \"here's some money\" option, and by the time you can actually\
      \ tackle the final few bounties, money will have long ceased to be of any use\
      \ to yo, nevermind a measly few million.\n\nThere are two other ships included\
      \ in the DLC, buyable at HQ for the low low price of 110 million each. The Deadly\
      \ Helios is an aggressive dreadnaught with a double hangar and weakish shields\
      \ but excellent gun placement and a cool, unique look. Worth checking out. The\
      \ Deadly Premonition is a completely overpowered carrier that is so ugly as\
      \ to be downright offensive. Both are callbacks to ships from the previous game\
      \ in the series.\n\nOverall, a nice chunk of content, nothing super major, but\
      \ well-done and worth the price, especially if on sale."
