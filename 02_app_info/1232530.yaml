    about_the_game: "A safe space can be used in treatment to give a client a sense\
      \ of security and comfort. A forest with a calm pond is an environment that\
      \ generally gives a kind of comfort that comes natural with humans. Safe spaces\
      \ can be used in many ways. It can be used to help a depressed person be at\
      \ ease, as a cooling-down experience after a client reached the peak of exposure\
      \ therapy. For anxious clients, a safe space can be an environment where they\
      \ can imagine themselves in during challenging moments in every day\u2019s life.\
      \ A safe space is often a completely imaginary space, and therefore a very personal\
      \ one (your childhood bedroom for instance). In order to personalize VR simulation\
      \ comes with many different options to match the preferences of the client.\
      \ The hue and saturation of the scenery can be changed, the time of day, volume\
      \ options for sound effects or background music, it comes with three relaxing\
      \ music tracks in different styles. Additionally, the therapist can make several\
      \ animals appear around the client. These are deer, ducks, a cat, a puppy, and\
      \ a horse."
