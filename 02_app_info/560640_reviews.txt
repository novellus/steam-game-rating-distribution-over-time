You either escape or die. When I did escape the final room, the game was just over and you see the credits. During the game, you heard some things, so I was expecting a little more of an ending then just \"boom\" finished, \"You Escaped\".\n\nI have been to numerous escape rooms in real life and there are always multiple keys that need to be found. The keys for this game are not really hidden but easily accessible and, for a VR version of an escape room and for a single person playing, you use the key and then whatever the next step is. Even though the game is really short in duration, it was worth the money I spent on it. \n\nAs in real life escape rooms where you have to duck and move around objects, the space is small in this game but you have to do this as well. I was on the floor and I even had to duck under some beams. Although you probably could walk through them, the graphics made you feel like you need to duck under them. Someone came in when I was getting one of the keys from the floor and was like \"What are you doing on the floor?\" They had thought I had tripped and fell or something. So being able to be immersed in the game or have the feeling like you needed to get down on the floor was really enjoyable.\n\nThe only issue I had was when I died, which I did die on my first play through, when I selected to restart the game, I ended up looking up towards the cabin. So the restart option in the game was bugged. But other than that, I really enjoyed the game. It was fun and I would recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1597728974,"timestamp_updated":1597728974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6yEgPQCfeGTnAI="}
