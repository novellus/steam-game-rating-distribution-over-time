The only decent art are the sprites. \n\nThe dialog is clunky. If you i. e. want to get a sex scene with a girl you have to first select choice 1, then choice 2 and so on until you're there (with lots of copy-pasted dialog in between of course). And the choices are the same for every girl. Bugs are common as well and the skip function does not work. \n\nIf you want to know more about the plot, you can read a text file contained within the game and the sex scenes are... not even acceptable. The cg's are straight bad... and this is not just  me being mean. It's probably the reason the screenshots up there don't show any sex scenes. \n\nThere is no romance, so why is the only thing the game was supposed offer, the sex scenes, the worst part of it!?\n\nThe characters behave the same as well. Always the same dialog for every character. \"Sorry, I'm not ready for this\". Proposing after first sex scene? Always works. The same getting-to-know events for every single character. More than one character-specific event? Don't you guys have phones? Argh, I'm tired of this. \n\nAnd one (date-able) person's a guy. For diversity purposes I guess? I mean I wouldn't care... but I expected yuri. It was pretty disappointing. \n\nHonestly, all of those bad games which seem like the dev started working on it yesterday annoy me so much. I would be okay with a game which would be in beta or something... but this would be basically pre-alpha.... wft? Someday we'll get so-called \"games\" which are just template ren'py projects and the people say \"It's still in early access\". 'Course it isn't complete.\" This game is not incomplete. This game will probably have triple the amount of time spent after early access release than before. \n\nHonestly, it feels like some 16 y/o publishes his passion products... on Steam... for money... no idea what to say. Bad. Don't buy. Save your money. Not worth it. No. Don't. Please.","timestamp_created":1594712535,"timestamp_updated":1607952917,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543313980102539063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603736796,"developer_response":"Hey there,\n\nThe game has just left Early Access and it has been significantly improved thanks to all the feedback I've received.
