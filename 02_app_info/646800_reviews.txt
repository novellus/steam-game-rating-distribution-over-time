The design is very beautiful and the colors give a special charm to each page. If you, like me, were enchanted by the world of Teslagrad and World to the West, you will surely enjoy this comic.","timestamp_created":1545271126,"timestamp_updated":1557514026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59810405969619751","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwb/E0eoCd9bdtQE="}
