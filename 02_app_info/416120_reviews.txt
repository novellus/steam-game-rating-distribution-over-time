I'd 100% recommend this game if there was a \"skip level\" button.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't like hard execution challenges much; I played through Super Meat Boy and Celeste once, and that's enough for one lifetime. If you like games like those, then this review probably won't apply to you.\n\nThis is a puzzle platformer where you can walk along two different tracks, with the goal being to stand under a cube on both tracks at once. In the beginning, this is used to move platforms around so you can ascend and whatnot. Later levels introduce more blocks, which give you more movement options. I gave up on level 75 because I couldn't work it out, but I had a lot of fun trying. Ignoring levels 25-30, this game is worth the price.\n\nPros: Decent music (Another review claims that there are only two tracks, but there is more music after level 30). Visual design is good; you can tell what's going on and it looks nice. The puzzles aren't hard until past 70ish, but require thinking in a different way than usual. The first level I particularly liked was 10, where I actually had to stop and consider where I needed to go to solve it. After level 30, the puzzles become significantly more intricate and interesting. I especially like how the later mechanics (purple respawn-point blocks, yellow block-moving blocks, and others) mesh with the game's main two-track mechanic; it was fun to see how they all interacted. I found myself continually surprised and amused at how they all came together to allow progression. I loved the twist at 56, although the return of the bounce pads was unwelcome. The puzzles are generally satisfying, with significant exceptions.\n\nBig cons: Massive difficulty spike around level 27. Unfortunately, this game includes levels with two very different kinds of challenges, and you are required to do both:\n    thinking challenges, where you have lots of time between steps,\n    and execution challenges, where you need to do specific steps one after the other quickly.\nIt's fine for puzzle games to have a little bit of execution challenge in them, e.g. on level 15, which is the first level where you to move in midair in both planes at once. Everyone has a different tolerance for that stuff. For me, levels 25-30 were a tedious, frustrating slog. I spent maybe 8 minutes going through the first 25 levels, and then around 20 minutes just on level 27. This is all the more tragic because levels 31 onwards return to thinking-challenge only, and were really, really good. If you can bring yourself to grind through to level 31, it's worth it. This could be solved by a) including a skip level feature, b) unlocking all the levels by default, or c) including a bullet time mechanic as Waddlen suggests. Also, some user-avoidable bugs forced me to reboot my computer (linux).\n\nLittle cons: The fractal or whatever on the bottom of the skybox flickers, which is distracting when you're looking from overhead. The platforms have a little bit sticking out to makes landing easier, but you have to jump to get on the main platform; this is frustrating when red blocks are directly over the platform. You have to turn the camera to see where you are in different planes; this makes execution challenges where you have to line up with green boost blocks in multiple planes much more luck than skill. Some levels have \"cheesy\" solutions, where you avoid the intended route. In particular, if you cheesed level 53, I recommend going back and doing it the intended way. It's very satisfying.\n\nBugs: I'm on Linux; these probably don't apply on Windows etc. Only one big bug, but it's a really terrible one: if the game window loses focus while you're in a level, it still swallows all of the inputs to your computer, so that keyboard becomes unresponsive and mouse only moves the game camera. Losing focus includes alt+tabbing to another window or using the volume control. It is not possible to return focus to the game e.g. by alt-tabbing back. Computer must be restarted to fix. I can avoid doing these things, but still a massive pain. Also, the game briefly freezes when you start a level for the first time in a session; this is resolved by exiting to menu and loading the level again. Also, the mouse curser is supposed to be replaced with a lambda shape/japanese character thing, but isn't when you first start the game.","timestamp_created":1592926080,"timestamp_updated":1592926080,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwOHy8PICd7TbjwI="}
