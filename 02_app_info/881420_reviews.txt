The Riders are a truly foreign civilisation that one has to learn about and understand the importance of things. You will likely fail your first few attempts, missing clues or simply not having the whole story. Your clan mates often don't have the entire picture and you often lack the cultural knowledge to understand some things. Sometimes, The spirits and the Gods are simply not with you.\n\nThis game is quite RNG based, however, it is not unfair. If you play it smart and genuinely make efforts to understand the games systems and take into account things potentially being able to fail, then you'll manage quite handily. \n\nThe game is very text heavy and will require a lot of Reading and Absorbing information and requires attention and focus, even though the game doesn't move at a fast pace. \n\nMusic is a 9/10, pleasant and fits the Mood of any given scene.","timestamp_created":1609830089,"timestamp_updated":1609830089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krjW6PYCePXPwAI="}
