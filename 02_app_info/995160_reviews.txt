I saw free games last longer, but the fun I got was worth the 1$. It's a very short game, but intense.\n\nHere's the deal: you are given the least manoeuvrable module ever – it is propelled by firing little balls which don't damage anything – in a small level and you must reach the exit. Did I forget to mention the sadistic traps and wicked weapons shooting at you? All of these are a perfect combination to get on your nerves, without which you won't succeed.\n\nThe game is not that hard. If you want more challenge, you can try to get the achievements, which are obtained by taking the bonus in each level, and pass each sector without dying once. But it still took me less than 90 minutes to beat the game completely. It's too short. It needs more levels and challenges, for instance time-based ones.\n\nI'll just point out that it needs to be a little more polished. The level selection screen could have been nicer. No need to give you a \"grade\" after each sector, the number of deaths would have been better. Some screens require to chose options using keyboard while the rest of the game use the mouse only. Since it's a game that's supposed to be played rather fast, restart buttons for level and sector would have been appreciated.","timestamp_created":1598542146,"timestamp_updated":1598542146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwna2imPQCcM+RngI="}
