    review: 'In my hour and twenty minutes with the game I beat the final boss and
      got a couple of the secrets scattered throughout. I will say I enjoyed it overall
      despite some minor frustrations, usually with difficulty.

      The level design is pretty good, nothing amazing, but there were definitely
      moments of intentionality which you don''t often see with these kind of flash-game
      like platformers. I really appreciated the unique death animations for each
      enemy type. I thought that was a neat touch. I also liked the simple but catchy
      music.

      There are some problems with hit detection, especially on the dark blue bouncing
      enemies, when you jump on them. Also I found the final boss a little frustrating
      but once I found a strategy to keep him from shooting rockets, he was beatable.
      I would have also liked to see more variety in the backgrounds.

      Overall fun game to spend an hour with and it seems like there is another set
      of levels coming which I''ll look forward to.'
