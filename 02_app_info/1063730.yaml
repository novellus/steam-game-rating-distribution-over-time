      \ /><br>With our August 25th launch approaching, we have been scrutinizing our\
      \ feature list, taking input from our Alpha audience, and listening to what\
      \ they enjoyed (or didn\u2019t!) about the current game. We're incredibly grateful\
      \ for all of the support and suggestions from our Alpha players, ranging from\
      \ the folks who spent thousands of hours in New World to those who just sampled\
      \ -- it's all valuable. <br><br>I\u2019m proud of the hard work the team has\
      \ done, making the game ready for launch with the features we intended for release.\
      \ We also have a list of features that we planned to start working on once we\
      \ were in live development, as that is part of operating an MMO. When we examined\
      \ the feedback we received over the last several months from our Alpha audience,\
      \ we saw that players like the game, and they would like to see even more of\
      \ it. In particular, we want to ensure that the most dedicated players have\
      \ plenty of middle and endgame experiences as they venture through Aeternum.\
      \ We want our players to feel completely immersed in the game, and know that\
      \ our studio stands for quality and lasting gameplay you can trust \u2014 and\
      \ that means added time to get things where we want them before we fully release.\
      \ <br><br>As a result, we will be changing our launch date - and correspondingly,\
      \ our final beta test - to spring 2021. We don't make the decision lightly,\
      \ and we have urgency about getting the game to you as quickly as possible at\
      \ the best quality -- with some additions that will make the experience even\
      \ better. <br><br>We\u2019re passionate about the game we\u2019ve been making\
      \ and want to add more features and content before we share it with a wider\
      \ audience. As a thank you to our community, we will be providing a special\
      \ opportunity for our Beta sign-up and pre-order customers (plus our Alpha testers,\
      \ thank you!) to play the full game of New World - in its current state, for\
      \ a limited period of time starting on August 25th. We will send an email directly\
      \ to those customers detailing the process to participate. We\u2019re confident\
      \ that you\u2019ll feel that the game has as much promise as we do, and will\
      \ understand why we want to take the extra time to make this experience the\
      \ best it can be at release.<br><br>- Rich Lawrence, Studio Director</p><br><h1>Pre-Purchase\
