It has a couple of weapons, a shield, and enemies, yes, but the enemies are all the same and the game is extremely boring. Think Space Pirate Trainer, then remove all of the cool effects, graphics, and various types of enemies. Boom, you have Hit the Hive. This game seems like a Demo produced by a student trying to learn to code for VR games. Not worth even downloading.","timestamp_created":1602455868,"timestamp_updated":1602455868,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpoL0jPUCfK2rpwI="}
