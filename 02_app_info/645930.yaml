    review: The graphics in this game are alright. The movements could be smoother.
      The concept is really cool, especially that everything is VR and more or less
      buttonless - you really only control your character's directional movements.
      Even to switch weapons you have to use your belt. It's fun but playing with
      the bots gets boring fast and the online multiplayer doesn't function for me
      most of the time.
