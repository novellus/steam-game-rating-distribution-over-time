The game offers quite an array of food to serve which is amazing, ranging from teas, drinks, fast foods, to culinary cuisines. The gameplay is quite straightforward, though there are some confusing parts like Investor information before any Investor is actually available and how to change the number of food served.\n\nFor most part, I try selling stuff at quite a high price and it seems to work itself out. A key tactic I have found is to get a spot \"traffic pattern\" to adjust the food served properly for that particular spot. Even if multiple areas are deficit, one major profit can reverse the tide (especially on bad days).\n\nI personally like this game for the simplicity yet enjoyment it gives me and thus would recommend this game, especially for those who seek to play a tycoon game without stressful economy management.","timestamp_created":1609313492,"timestamp_updated":1609313492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwuOj2fYCeoTavgI="}
