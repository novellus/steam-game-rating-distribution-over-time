    review: 'This is a wonderful and very heart-warming game. The story is delightful,
      telling of Corinne''s coming to terms with her status as a medium to the ghostly
      inhabitants of the B&B she finds herself taking care of for a week. In that
      time, you are tasked with taking care of said ghosts by looking after their
      needs, each in a slightly different way. There is an "action point management"
      element to it, as everything makes the player character more tired, but I never
      went below 50% in my standard play - I believe NG+ is harder.  I completed a
      "standard" game in just under 2.5 hours, with New Game+ mode opening up after
      that, so I suspect the game is 100%able in about 5-6 hours.


      The game is consistently upbeat and, as it says, not scary. It does take some
      fairly heavy subject matter and slide over it a little freely, but that suits
      the nature of what the game wants to be.


      The art style is great, and the music is perfect for the length of the game.
      I also think the controls have been updated since some reviews, as I had no
      difficulty with them. The only thing that seemed a little odd to me is that
      one of the later rooms that you can unlock has an exit that is different to
      that which you expect, and I found myself entering (or trying to enter) another
      room more often than leaving the room itself. I understand the design choice,
      but in a game I find little issue with, it was oddly frustrating.


      I highly recommend this game, and hope that you get the same enjoyment from
      it that I did.'
