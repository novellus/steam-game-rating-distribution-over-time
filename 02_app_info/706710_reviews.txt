The old version of Close Your Eyes is without a doubt one of my favorite indie games out there, especially in terms of story. I am happy that this remake, which also contains so much more than the original game to the point that one could call this a sequel (which it may be, who knows!), was made. I am more than happy to buy this game (while the old one was free, I would have absolutely paid to play it) and as said before, I am eagerly anticipating the next update to this game.","timestamp_created":1602687266,"timestamp_updated":1602687266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzd3mk/UCeZ7qpwI="}
