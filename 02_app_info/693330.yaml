    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Also, I updated\
      \ review now that it is free to play. [/h1]\n\n[i] Note: only issue on the Oculus\
      \ that I experienced was that the button mapping wasn't exactly correct. You\
      \ click on the left joystick to warp the ball to you. Then after throwing the\
      \ ball (press left trigger and let go with arm movement) you have to to click\
      \ down the right hand controller joystick to move in that direction. To get\
      \ to menu, you press Y button. [/i]\n\nThis is a very simple looking game with\
      \ a strange movement mechanic at the start of the game. You have to throw a\
      \ ball and then you'll move in the direction you threw it. You can warp the\
      \ ball back to your hand to change direction or catch and throw the ball again\
      \ to increase speed. On the second level, you can pick up the ball and throw\
      \ again to gain acceleration. On the third level, you simply shoot at the white\
      \ cubes and you'll teleport to them. On another level, you lose your ball and\
      \ must rely on shooting the white cubes and momentum to traverse the level.\
      \ \n\nYour enemies are geometric shapes that shoot at you. You have to shoot\
      \ them down and also shoot or avoid the bullets they are shooting at you. There's\
      \ several levels and some kind of convoluted story thrown in bits and pieces.\
      \ You can pickup health potions along the way. There's also some levels where\
      \ you have to find keys. And there are also boss fights thrown in. There is\
      \ a checkpoint system where you spawn near the yellow cubes. Once you clear\
      \ a level, the next level will appear for you to be able to get to, acting as\
      \ a save system.\n\nIf enemies detect you, within proximity range, they can\
      \ start shooting at you. They can also shoot through walls. So you do have to\
      \ be strategic in your approach to blind corners. And you have to find ways\
      \ to quickly change course to avoid heavy damage and to get clear line of sights\
      \ to the enemy. It is not unusual to not have a direct line of fire to the enemies,\
      \ so you're moving not just to avoid damage but to cause damage as well.\n\n\
      I got it on sale for $.99 cents. It's definitely different than anything else\
      \ I've played in VR so I think it's worth .99 cents for that reason alone. In\
      \ fact, after playing around the game some more it had a lot more depth to the\
      \ gameplay and is different than most shooters so it was a hidden gem and easily\
      \ worth more than a buck. It does not have the best graphics or sounds, but\
      \ the gameplay is solid and challenging. And I had fun. Beating the boss on\
      \ that second level for the first time felt very satisfying.\n\nNew Rating 7.5/10.\
      \ One of the better free to play VR games. Thank you dev for making this free\
      \ to play and great job!"
