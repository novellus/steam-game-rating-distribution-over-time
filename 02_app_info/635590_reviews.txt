This game is much better than just a TouHou ripoff and that is a very difficult thing to achieve while keeping the bullet-hell AND scrolling shoot-em-up theme AND great music. definetly recomend this game, unless you cant handle being dangerously close to lighning fast bullets almost all the time. i only played it for a few minutes because thats all my heart could take and i wanted the honor of writing the first real review (real meaning not just saying \"first\").","timestamp_created":1513741135,"timestamp_updated":1513741135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568329513072967529","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yZWAueACedjTkgE="}
