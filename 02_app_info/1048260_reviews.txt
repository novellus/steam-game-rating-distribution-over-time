I would much prefer to play this game on a controller, at least a partial support would be nice. Some of the actions like jump might need a sound effect. Also, you can't jump down through the platform which is a bit annoying. I will say that I enjoyed the story cutscenes, there are many cute pictures, and the animation in general is not too bad. However, all of the 3 worlds in the game look very similar; the stages have a metallic landscape with a few changing backgrounds. While you don't get any special moves (just a regular jump), the game has 3 different powers-ups that will interact with environment. You can find a metal suit that protects you from damage, jetpack that allows you to fly, and a plasma cannon for fighting enemies. If you collect enough points you can buy a few different upgrades like maximum life, power-up duration and ability modifiers. \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ decent animation & cute story\n+ several upgrades\n+ nice soundtrack \n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- needs controller support\n- needs more sound effects\n- can't jump down through platforms \n- the stages are kinda repetitive \n- could use achievements \n\n[b] Overall Thought: 5/10 [/b]\n\nIt might be okey if you don't mind a casual game, it just feels somewhat underdeveloped.\n\n[code]If the game shows some improvements, I will consider removing this review. Please contact me if you have updated your game and want a revision.[/code]","timestamp_created":1555124875,"timestamp_updated":1555151256,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579075634479522705","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnJ+Pi+oCdrGQvwE="}
