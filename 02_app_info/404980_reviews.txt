I am in love with this engine it is better than I could have asked for.... with ONE excpetion. I cannot use the whistle without the bell automatically activating? I hit the horn button and then the bell activates which could be useful if you are at a crossing, but I hate it when I am doing shunting moves and use it for starting and stopping, having to turn off bell each time.","timestamp_created":1467436272,"timestamp_updated":1467436272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595375716686248779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmJGB1dUCe9PJWw=="}
