    review: 8/10, criminally underrated, extremely engaging story and characters,
      gorgeous game design. Points knocked off because levels are kind of too straightforward
      at times (would've loved some more exploration elements), and combat mechanics
      are a bit wonky, especially companion AI, but fun and challenging all in all.
      Lots of loose ends and so much lore leftover at the end though. SEQUEL PLEASE?
