    review: "Very interesting game. As someone who enjoys text-based projects, I found\
      \ the attention to detail effective and at times even experimentally poetic.\
      \ The character development was astonishing considering the lack of visual detail;\
      \ these kind of projects prove that nothing, no strong graphics nor interesting\
      \ music nor slick controls, trump good writing.\n\nMAJOR/MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\
      \nI particularly liked all the details that went into the poltergeists 'riddle'\
      \ and the following optional quest. These were perfect; you could guess them\
      \ without help, yet they weren't ridiculously challenging in the way videogame\
      \ text-based puzzles often are. \n\nThe details with the teenager's mental health\
      \ also stood out to me as a relatively fresh take on magic, technology, and\
      \ boundaries. Very cool. This game is made with a lot of forethought and empathy,\
      \ two things that are as difficult to capture as an elemental firewall."
