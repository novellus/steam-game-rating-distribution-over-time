Krieg is one of my favorite characters, and I went into this expecting to find just a rollercoaster ride of absurdity and weirdness. What I got was honestly a fascinating and emotionally impactful story. Maybe the mechanics of the DLC were lacking, but I value the story more. It fleshed Krieg out, made him utterly fascinating. I was paying complete attention the entire time. The banter between the two Kriegs was amusing, but the really interesting part was his relationship with Maya, and his origins. If you take the time to listen to the dialogue, and to find the echo logs scattered throughout, you discover just how complex Krieg is.\n\nIn short, I feel this DLC took a DLC character that was made, originally, as sort of a joke (Big crazy man screams weird and funny things), and turned him into one of the most complex characters in the series. Whole lot of duality going on. So if you're thinking of playing it, don't make your decision based off of people whining about the mechanics. It's Borderlands, you shoot, kill, loot, repeat. Play it if you want a deeper look into one of the most entertaining characters written in the series.","timestamp_created":1610009890,"timestamp_updated":1610009890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzamE7vYCeeicwQI="}
