    about_the_game: With Wacken Open Air drawing 85,000 metalheads from around the
      world every August, each chapter of Welcome to Wacken is told from the perspective
      of a fan. From the nervous first-timers in search of acceptance, to the festival
      veteran with a spiritual connection to the music, each profile focuses on a
      unique aspect of the festival known as the Mecca of Metal. The five episodes
      (and additional bonus materials) are housed within an interactive map of the
      festival, allowing viewers to explore Wacken much as they would in real life.
      This combination of cinematic storytelling and interactive exploration represents
      a new form of immersive documentary, tailored to the experience of Wacken Open
      Air.

    review: "tested on oculus rift the main menu is a great idea it remenber a bd\
      \ style \nbut for the others parts i am really disapointed \nthe videos use\
      \ not a  real 3dvr stereoscopic , it seems to be a conversion in 3d 360 since\
      \ the characters appear like quasi flat in the video i seen  ,  and the videos\
      \ ask a lot of times to load , the menu when we loading  the videos has sometimes\
      \ an issue about moved lens (my poor eyes ) \n\nthe content seemed great but\
      \ need to download all the videos ,have pain to the eyes during the loading\
      \ and have quasi flat character quasi not stereoscopic in the first videos i\
      \ seen (i gave up to download the others )  i can t recommanded....\none day\
      \ i will try to download or watch the others videos and if they are differents\
      \ i will change my review \n\n"
