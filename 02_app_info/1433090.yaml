    review: "I really wish I could recommend this game, since the art style and premise\
      \ are very promising. However, the English version of the game (can't say anything\
      \ about the other languages) is rather badly written and often hard to grasp\
      \ and understand, having you read through the text multiple times, and even\
      \ then sometimes doubting yourself, if you understood what the writer meant.\
      \ I do hope the developer of the game would hire someone who has a good grasp\
      \ of the English language to translate the game, as this was the defining factor\
      \ for me in not recommending this game as opposed to recommending it, especially\
      \ since this is a visual novel.\n\nRegarding the mechanics, I find myself wishing\
      \ for a skip option for when I've already read a portion of the text and would\
      \ like to see what happens after making a different decision. Right now, it's\
      \ quite a chore going through the same dialogue every time, especially so with\
      \ the unskippable cutscenes. \n\nI haven't gotten far into the game yet, but\
      \ these are my thoughts so far."
