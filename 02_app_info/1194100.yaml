    review: 'If you enjoy mindlessly clicking on dots on the screen with your mouse
      cursor as fast as you can with no fail state, no leaderboards, and no rewards
      no matter how many clicks you make, then this game is for you!  If not, save
      your money.

      NOT RECOMMENDED.. However I''ve challenged the developer to make some easy changes
      that could make this game much better.  Maybe do the same for him if you have
      ideas as well on his forums here!  =)'
