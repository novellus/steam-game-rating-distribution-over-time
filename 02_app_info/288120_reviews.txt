Gameplay is turn-based and easy to pass up based on prejudice of presentation, but you will have missed out on a gem.  Not only is it fun to play, Dungeonmans represents a new step in the development of a very, very old legacy -- older than the Internet, older than Windows and even DOS, to when a computer had one -millionth- the memory yours does now.  Dungeonmans takes a fine, sacred tradition, adds generously in personality and presentation, and offers some of the best few bucks you'll ever spend on Steam.\n\nIf you've never played a \"roguelike\", or you've never heard the term, there's a learning curve you'll find a little steep at first, but stick with it -- once you get the hang of it, the rhythm of this kind of game, it's addictive.  For those who've played a roguelike before, this is a new twist -- permadeath is totally a thing, but not ALL of you dies.\n\nFound an Academy and create your first hero.  Strike out to make a name for yourself and your Academy.  Early on, while you aren't clear on how to survive well, there will be bumps in the road and your heroes will fall -- but \"you\" are not the heroes; \"you\" are a collection of heroes, the legacy of the entire Academy.  Whatever knowledge your heroes live to bring back, the Academy keeps; your graduates steadily start better and better equipped through the efforts of those who came before, perhaps even taught additional skills by adventurers past who teach at the Academy.","timestamp_created":1435112356,"timestamp_updated":1610136859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l9bo8fYCdbjJPw=="}
