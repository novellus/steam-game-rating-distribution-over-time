After this we meet a dryad girl which are considered after the squirrels warning as evil and have to be avoided.\nThese warings thoughs couldnt be cnfirmed by him and the dryad seemed t be actually really caring.\nLater on after encountering again the squirrel he got informed that the forest the dryad are obscured by a dark  god s powwer thank tothe dryadd Lady and therefore it is known that the humans in the village felll ill thanks to this dark presence. Soon he found himself encountering another squirrel which ended up bringing him alongin her village and to be the princess of the village and therewe meet again Rika the first squirrel we met.From there on we are ordered to do all kind of things as to purify, to do, to entertain  and to go on mission, do participate in a sacred ance etc.... From there on we also build relationships and with each event event if chosing the right option we are likely rewarded with a scene of some adult content.\n\nThe storyflow is rather quickpaced but the universe it is set is a interesting and intriguing one, with alot of different places. The races are also well though the artstyle is relatively  good, though for there expression there is some adjustement and improving necessary, they are not really how expressions should be and so its missing some authentiity of the current subjects, \n\nI can definitely recommend this VN, it is not a complete story, it seems like a second part will be coming in near future and complete the already good story. The story itself n this part isnt long, for slow reader around 10hours the story has been read and little more if you through all 3 different routes.","timestamp_created":1602113997,"timestamp_updated":1602113997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jPHbgvUCevrApgI="}
