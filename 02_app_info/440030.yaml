    review: 'Honestly, this DLC is a hit-miss thing for me. I enjoy the promo cards
      (Battle Screecher, Megahauler, the Ark, etc.) but the gambits themselves feel
      either underpowered or overpowered. It just feels cheap when your opponent plays
      a gambit that just accelerates their lead and makes it impossible for you to
      catch up.


      There is no "so okay it''s average" option, unfortunately.'
