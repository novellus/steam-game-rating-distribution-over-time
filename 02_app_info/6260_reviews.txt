But there are some things i think could be improved.\nI got into this kinda games due to Making history, i bought the game. I played it and find it impossible to play with the minor countries (game editor). I also tried to give a specific country some extra resources but i haven't found a way to raise the produced crop. This is expensive on the market so i ended with a incredible negative balance each year wich causes my workers to be less effective which only makes the financial problems bigger and the factory outcome evenly poor. \nPlaying the mayor countries is nice but you are being forced into the historical situation a bit too much to my opinion. I soon tried to make my own history as the game says to support but find that hard to realize.\nIt is a nice game and it got me into this type of games. I've been looking at hearts of iron but i'm thinking about playing victoria II first.","timestamp_created":1487164381,"timestamp_updated":1487164381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49PL5oNoCcOGbcg=="}
