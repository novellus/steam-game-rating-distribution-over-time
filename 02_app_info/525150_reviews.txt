If you're one of these people who thinks a person has to play a game for 1,000 hours before daring to criticize the fonts used in the game, find something more interesting to say. This is bad, and I determined this in fewer than 21 minutes.\n\nThe visuals will sell you, of course. The weird concept is neat. It does not play well. The difficulty spikes in a terribly uninteresting way. That last point is the real issue. Spikes in difficulty, even unfair ones? Not always an issue. Rather, it's that the whole game ends up painfully uninteresting, even for this type of game, often of passing interest by design. Nothing compels to get past the humps. Success in whatever it's trying to get you to do level to level seems disconnected from your own actions, and thus does not satisfy as gameplay. What a dud.\n\nIt's a mobile-ish reiteration of the send-out-your-troops-and-launch-attacks-on-timers sort of game that rewards CRITICALLY IMPORTANT upgrade points based on the old three star level performance rating. Yes, another game that becomes theoretically more difficult the further you go without perfecting every level left in your wake. Figure out the single way to beat the improbably difficult second level boss, and then... whatever. The star ratings serve better as an extra challenge, not as the bricks of the wall built to obstruct the main strut of the game. This is bad design.\n\nAnd it's all just so uninteresting. This surprised me given the immediate oddity of the thing, normally a very appealing feature of a game. I don't know if I have issues with the controls. The minions seem not terribly interested in doing what you expect them to do. They'll kill things, not always the one attacking you. Yeah, if you fire one of your slow-to-load missiles or such at enemies, they die. There will usually be a prohibitive number more following right behind. You can use your pet to do whatever at times. I don't know whatever other greater sense of control I can take over the game. I don't know, I don't care. Too old for this. Not enough time to keep fighting with a game.\n\nThis was a ramble, but there's a point in there somewhere. Refunded on principle.","timestamp_created":1608918410,"timestamp_updated":1609878905,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4itSQ6vYCdIuPvQI="}
