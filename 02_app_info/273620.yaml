    review: "OK. This is a game from 1999. If you are expecting it to work straight\
      \ out of the box on a modern computer you will be disappointed. Even if it does\
      \ work (it did for me), the 1999 graphics are a bit sad.\n\nFor all those children\
      \ crying that it's broken, no it isn't. It's just not compatible with modern\
      \ hardware. Don't expect an official patch because the game was essentially\
      \ abandoned in 2002. If any of that upsets you, move along and save your \xA3\
      3.49 because this game isn't for you.\n\nOK, so why is Steam selling a 'broken'\
      \ game from 1999 that doesn't even work on a modern machine? That's easy. It's\
      \ because it was, and still is, one of the best 'space simulation' games ever.\
      \ While there haven't been any official patches for two decades, there are new\
      \ unofficial ones every few weeks.\n\nThere is a large and active community\
      \ of fans who have kept the game alive and updated for twenty years. The game's\
      \ source code was released in 2002 under a non-commercial license, and FreeSpaceOpen\
      \ was born. There are now games based on Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5 and\
      \ the Wing Commander series, all using an updated version of the FS2 code. FS2\
      \ itself has been completely worked over, with new hi-resolution graphics, new\
      \ voice acting and new music. The original Freespace 1 game has also been ported\
      \ across and given the same updates. Dozens of new campaigns and missions have\
      \ been added.\n\nThe latest builds of the game engine support 1440p monitors\
      \ and current graphics cards - I'm using a GTX 1060 6GB.\n\nTo get it up to\
      \ the latest standard is really easy. Buy FreeSpace 2 from Steam and install\
      \ it. Download the FreeSpaceOpen mod installer called Knossos. Run Knossos and\
      \ tell it where your installation of FreeSpace 2 is. Browse the catalogue of\
      \ mods, download whatever takes your fancy and play. The Knossos launcher also\
      \ has a settings box where you can adjust your sound and graphics preferences.\
      \ Note that you won't be playing the Steam version of the game at all, so your\
      \ Steam overlay won't work and your playing time won't register. The Steam version\
      \ is just there so the Knossos launcher can see you own a legitimate copy of\
      \ the game for copyright and licensing purposes.\n\nI bought this game new in\
      \ 1999, in the original retail box. I've enjoyed playing it for years. After\
      \ building a new computer I decided to resurrect all my old games and get them\
      \ working. Rather than messing about finding the box in the loft, I spent the\
      \ price of a coffee on the Steam version. It took maybe ten minutes from hitting\
      \ \"purchase now\" to playing The Babylon Project mod in 1440p widescreen.\n\
      \nThe one and only criticism I have is that it doesn't support multiple USB\
      \ input devices, so I can't use my rudder pedals and joystick together. I have\
      \ a Thrustmaster T-Flight stick, with a twist for the rudder so I can work around\
      \ it.\n\nThis game was criminally underrated when it came out. Do yourself a\
      \ favour and drop \xA33.49 on it, and download the latest community patches\
      \ to play the best space combat game ever."
