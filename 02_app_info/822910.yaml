    short_description: Control a squad of fearless soldiers with unique abilities
      to stop a mad scientist who is ready to open a portal for creatures from hell.
      A classical turn-based system and procedural generation of levels which would
      require various tactical decisions to beat the game.

    review: "[b][i]Mortal Squad: Portal to Hell[/i] is a nice little [i]XCOM[/i] clone\
      \ with a bit more rogue-ish elements.[/b] While the developer should be proud\
      \ of this project, I cannot recommend my friends go out and spend their money\
      \ and time. It's just a matter of practicality. Too much top-notch [i]XCOM[/i]\
      \ and [i]Xenonaughts[/i] content exists, and most people haven't exhausted that\
      \ yet. \n\n[b]What can I say? This is a neat little project, but just needs\
      \ a little more polish in most areas to be competitive.[/b] And I do mean that\
      \ in nice way. I surely don't expect every indie project to have high-end assets,\
      \ writing, and unique gameplay. But we do need [i]some[/i] of that."
