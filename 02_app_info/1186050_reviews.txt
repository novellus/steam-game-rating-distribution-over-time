Lots of enemies to dodge or wade through, but exploration is definitely the hook here.\n\nIt's nice to explore around and open new paths after getting stronger. I also like the vision system, it creates a sense of claustrophobia/danger as you walk through forests or dark caves. The monsters also cry out when you have disturbed the peace, which can be ominous with limited vision.\n\nThe level design and music have been pretty great so far and can't wait to see the areas I haven't been to yet.\n\nUPDATE:\nI'm like 24+ hours into it and had a blast. I've beaten the game a few times at different Completion Percentages and there are still a bunch of things I haven't done, yet. For anyone looking for a chill exploration game to rabbit hole into, this is a great option.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8VUt47DPs","timestamp_created":1609484753,"timestamp_updated":1609743815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4laqN5vYCccOpvwI="}
