It's complex but accessible, gritty, funny and the combat is a joyful mess.  \n\nBlow up, board, capture and reverse engineer almost everything.  \n\nYou go from piloting small frigates, corvettes and destroyers to battleships and battlecruisers.  The game scale goes from flying and dogfighting to commanding swarms of fighter drones while maintaining your repairs.\n\nBeing pursued by multiple enemy craft, using long range weapons to wear them down.\n\nIn combat with multiple enemy ships, allocating bombers and firing missiles while planning movement and repairs.  It is complex and enjoyable.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1709879309\n\n[h1]1/2021[/h1]\n\nWell, I've seen and played the multi.  It's no joke, and it's as glorious as I thought it would be.  Players manning guns, keeping the ship together, getting ejected into space or floating off with a severed hunk of ship.  Boarding ships and capturing.  \n\nI'm in a weird place, having spent literally years arguing with the developer to add multi and him saying no, you're stupid and bad, shut up and now adding multi.  I should feel overjoyed and triumphant but I was too busy enjoying it to really seek closure with that.\n\nWho argues with their pusher, right?  I got what I wanted, and it was everything I hoped it would be and more.  Eventually you'll get to see this too and you'll understand.  \n\nI'm impatiently awaiting that day.\n\n\n[h1]4/2019[/h1]\n\nAll anyone cares about right now is multiplayer.  The devs either staged a very poorly advised april fools joke in which they demonstrated a multiplayer game, or they have finally listened to their audience.\n\nThis game with coop multi would sell more copies than angry birds.  Period.  Hopefully some day the devs will stop spiting people for their failed kickstarter and decide to become rich and famous. \n\nThe game has grown steadily over time.  Devs seem a little less active in the community.  The game is buggier than it was 6 months ago in odd ways.  \n\nI should point out, as has been mentioned that the devs can be arrogant, obnoxious and rude at times.  There's no better indication what these developers are about than the fact that there is no subforum for ideas and suggestions.  \n\nFor good or ill, this is George's game and contributions are hard won, not eagerly welcomed.\n\n[h1]7/2018[/h1]\nBack again with another 6 month playthrough.\n\nSo far, so good.  The new schematic system does a great job of requiring effort to research the body of schematics without it being a blocker.  \n\nThe combat system seems largely the same, which is good because the combat is good.\n\nI've run into a few bugs, nothing really serious.  The game is in much better shape than it was a year ago, significantly better shape than 6 months ago.\n\nI have not yet run into any of the things that caused me so much distress in previous builds - like the RNG ship capture terminals. \n\nI would say without a doubt, that the game in the current shape is a must-buy.  It's really the best of breed of ship builders that are out there, with significant advances that many of the others do not even approach.\n\nget it, play it.  you can thank me later.\n\n\n\n\n[h1]1/2018[/h1]\nAnother 6 months, another play through.\n\nI'm extremely pleased to find that the biggest hurdles of the schematic system have been addressed through various means.  The former problems have been largely eliminated with well thought out mechanisms.\n\nThere are more 'guaranteed schematics' as drops, you start with the basic hallways and some other items, shops seem to have a better selection of blueprints and you can take specific missions from NPCs that will award you a blueprint you don't yet have.\n\nWhile the game still has that (to me) unbearable feature of random chance to fail to capture ships, I have to accept that this doesn't bother other people to the degree that it bothers me.  I have a workaround for that so with the exception of Marv's antics of shooting my passengers and running out of the airlock to his demise instead of staying put, things are looking much brighter.\n\nIt gives me pleasure to be able to recommend this game, because I still contend that this is the best of breed of build/fly games and it has tremendous potential yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n[h1]EDIT: 5/2017[/h1]\nI've modified the game through decompiling and editing to remove the 'random chance to capture a ship' and I can play it.  I would not recommend buying it unless you can do the same.\n\n_____________________________________\n[h1] Jan 2017 [/h1]\n\n[strike]The recent changes to the game render it unplayable and unenjoyable to me. I would not recommend it with the current game mechanics.  [/strike] \n\nToo many things in this game have a 'random' outcome which means you either save-scum the game or you deal with dice-roll outcomes that are pass-fail no retry on things that can take quite literally 20 minutes to accomplish.\n\nThis game is technically interesting, and has a lot of merit in that regard but there appears to be a lack of cohesive design playability grasp.\n\n_____________________________________\n[h1]Initial review[/h1]\n\nSo, this is a very interesting game with a lot of emergent gameplay.  It has some rough edges, like any indie dev game can but also it has brilliance.  The very sort of brilliance you can't find in AAA titles because no committee will ever agree upon things that are controversial.\n\nWhile I wil admit there are some design choices I strongly dislike and that I think will inhibit the game's ultimate success, these are details and not reflective of the systems in the gameplay.  \n\n[strike]Specifically first the game forces a save on death, which is problematic since there are a lot of ways to 'die' that feel arbitrary or are the result of bugs or a lack of indicators - such as a lack of oxygen on the player's ship while flying, or walking over nearly-invisible damage on a ship's tiles, or just randomly dying while going through an airlock.  [/strike]\n\nNow add to this, the numerous legitimate ways to die including taking on something tougher than you are [strike]or running into rocks[/strike] and you have a lot of sudden deaths.\n\nCombine that with the lack of any remote places to respawn, and it ends up being a 'fly back to the spot' simulator at times, which is super not fun.  \n\nSecondly, the way loot is generated is awkward.  You can loot 'blueprints' for ship parts, however these blueprints aren't final until you 'reveal' them, and at that point they can randomly be useful, or junk.  If they are junk, you can alt-f4 and reload the game and try again until you get a result that is non-junk.  I don't know about you, but knowing this I am forced to save scum, and I find this method extremely unsatisfying.    I'd prefer less loot and have it all be real, personally.  \n\nThat aside the engineering parts of the game are great.  Designing ships is a lot of fun, and using your own designs in combat is a nice experience.  There are a lot of emergent systems that reward careful and intelligent design.\n\n[strike]The price is a touch high for the amount of content available, but the game was worth it to me because I've wanted to play a game like this for a while.  [/strike]\n\nI have to admit, though the devs repeatedly deny it - I still hold out hope for multiplayer, and most certainly more crew options for the player.\n\nAll that said, if you are an engineer like myself, this game is a strong recommendation.","timestamp_created":1456228335,"timestamp_updated":1609720486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwh6u05fYCepPTUQ=="}
