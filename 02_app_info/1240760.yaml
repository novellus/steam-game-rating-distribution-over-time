    review: If you've never played the game before, The Adventures of Ten and Till
      has a god-tier soundtrack. Excellent composition, instrumentation, and variety
      lends the game one of the best soundtracks to grace a danmaku game in recent
      years period. The only real issue is that you're buying a soundtrack from Steam,
      so the quality is only going to be a passable 128 kbps. Of course, I bought
      the soundtrack anyway because it truly is that good and I'll support the game
      in any way I can. :)
