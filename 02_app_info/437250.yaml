    review: This is a well written game and clearly the result of a lot of creativity
      and intelligence. I mildly enjoyed it for quite a few hours.  The game has essentially
      3 phases and there are problems with each.  When not travelling, you spend a
      lot of time ploughing through text, some of which is funny and clever, but much
      of which is just silly.  When you go travelling, you go into the graphic / navigation
      mode, which is very primitive and unfortunately takes a horrendously tedious
      amount of time.  That is the main reason I got fed up with the game and quit.  The
      third phase is battle, which is not properly developed and consequently feeble.  I
      won all my battles without using the tiniest amount of thought or strategy and
      it was just boring.  Sadly I have to give it a thumbs down overall.
