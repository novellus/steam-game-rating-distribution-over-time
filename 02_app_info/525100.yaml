    about_the_game: SLIVER.tv is a platform to record, view, and stream top esports
      games in fully immersive, 360 VR video. Our cutting edge, patented technology
      immerses the audience inside a 3D game world, viewing their favorite players
      and matches in an exciting new way never seen before. Many games that incorporate
      VR spectating require you to own the game or download a client; this is not
      one of those platforms. Instead, SLIVER.tv is a place to watch 360 VR game content
      from any source, similar to how one might currently watch a video on Youtube,
      or a streamer on Twitch!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Watch esports from inside
