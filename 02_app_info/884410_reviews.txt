Unnatural has a great feel to it that reminds me of \"monster a day\" shows like X-Files or Grimm.\n\nThe only part I find that hurts in the story is the world building. It's a bit lacking in parts and doesn't pull off the feel of a modern fantasy world that great. A solid story either way.","timestamp_created":1606269176,"timestamp_updated":1606269176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjNHG/vUCdeyrsAI="}
