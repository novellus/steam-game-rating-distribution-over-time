Similarly, the rules are simple (for example, stone blocks can be pushed one space forward on non-ice surfaces, ice blocks slide across the ground, other blocks slide on ice, fire blocks melt ice, etc).  How you accomplish the goal is anything but simple, especially in the later stages.  These puzzles are very well-designed, often requiring significant logical thinking to deduce the correct solution.\n\nThere are 30 stages total, grouped into 6 areas, and you must complete all 5 stages in one area before you can proceed to the next area.  There are different types of blocks (stone, ice, fire/red-hot, freezer, flame-thrower, and teleporter), which allow for very diverse and intricate puzzles.  I did not encounter any errors or inconsistent behavior.\n\nIf you're a puzzle enthusiast, I definitely recommend this game.  I found it to be extremely fun and satisfying, and you can't beat the price.","timestamp_created":1560047386,"timestamp_updated":1560047386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2b+EnesCfbaFwwE="}
