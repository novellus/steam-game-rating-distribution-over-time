    review: "Absolutely interesting, worth more than 5$ but I probably wouldn't have\
      \ bought it if it were. Slight annoyance that supposedly 0.5sec reload seems\
      \ different from one gun to another, but I've enjoyed the gameplay, somewhat\
      \ dungeon crawling and carnival shooter on 360 degree. \n\nThat said, it is\
      \ probably too simple. Dungeons aren't randomized so not much replayability.\
      \ only reason you play from early level is to grab more coins to buy expensive\
      \ guns. As far as I've seen, it's all 1 on 1 fight after you chose a room to\
      \ go to. unlock stronger guns and pay to acquire them seems redundant. Enjoyed\
      \ picking loot around although a bit annoying to shoot cuz you've aimed a millimeter\
      \ to the left."
