This might be one. If not, it is otherwise a low-effort game.\n\nStore page also lies or at least exaggerates greatly. It lists the following features:\n\n[quote][olist]\n[*]Increasing Complexity\n[*] Dynamic Music\n[*] Beautiful Visual style[/olist][/quote]\n\nFirst, there's three enemy types. Each has one straightforward attack pattern. The game progresses in \"waves\" that show diminutive differences to each other; maybe there's slightly more enemies in each wave. I couldn't tell the difference.\n\nSecond, the music seems not dynamic at all. It's a looping track, not different from calm to a fierce moment.\n\nVisual style is okay but I would not describe it as beautiful. It's hardly even original.\n\n[h1]Obfuscated features and bugs[/h1]\n\nThere's no in-game story - you can read the incomprehensible blurb about [i]Kenbo[/i] on the store page instead.\n\nYou have a pistol and an assault rifle that you access with mouse roll, but the game never tells you this. The weapons seem to have no differences, except the AR is better. Ammo is only counted per clip but you have infinite clips, so once I found the rifle, I never saw need to switch.\n\nNo rebinding keys nor native controller support exists. WASD moves the soldier, and mouse is used to aim, shoot, and throw grenades. You can jump and even double-jump.\n\nThere's some tactic involved: grenades kill big dudes, while shooting is more efficient for small and fast runners and kamikaze birds (er, \"gyrocopters\"). I noticed that the big dude could not even hit me if I stood still (did I mention it was low effort?!).\n\nGrenades do lots of damage to enemies *and* you. Sometimes, a grenade spawned seemingly randomly to my feet, which was confusing and made me wish for a quick health crate. In addition to health, crate drops contain grenades and instant screen-kills.\n\n[h1]Too long, simply boring game[/h1]\n\nGame never tells, not even on its store page how long it is. Well, I can now tell you: it's ten (10) waves. Ten waves that last several minutes each and that are essentially identical. I will also tell you that it was incredibly boring. Also, if you die, you start over from wave 1, so while it's fairly easy, you can't ease out.\n\nIt lasted for 1 hour. I only continued because I wanted the last achievement. The end came suddenly in mid-fight, before I killed the last enemies. The end screen was just black nothingness.\n\nCan you tell how [b]not recommended[/b] it is?*\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]\n\n(* Psst...! Not even on sale. I can't believe I actually bought it.)\n\nEDIT addendum: [i]Kenbo[/i] might also be an asset flip. Here's another game with similar gameplay according to trailer, called [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1387340/My_War/]My War[/url]. I'll pass that one.","timestamp_created":1596849172,"timestamp_updated":1601939008,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673745512962341309","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoK3A/fQCfoCLmgI="}
