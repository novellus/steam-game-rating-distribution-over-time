PSF 2021 game is far more terrible then PSF 2020 is. and I can no longer support playing a game that the Dev refuses to address yet major features like a 53 man roster which to me is a big part of the game. The only thing that makes PSF better is that the game supports modding which is far better then the Axis Football series has.   \n1. Next years version PSF 2021 will still only have 43 man rosters and no 53 man roster support which to me is terrible In terms of development. \n2. The league expansion only goes up to 32 teams but no big deal.\n3. Only has career mode but again no big deal because the seasons are unlimited. \n4. This is hardly a better Football sim when compared to the Axis Football series\n5. I can't recommend buying the new version when It does come out because PSF 2021 will not be any better If not even worse then PSF 2020 is.","timestamp_created":1569608431,"timestamp_updated":1598370076,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456394404172897339","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vqRk/QCdaT90gE="}
