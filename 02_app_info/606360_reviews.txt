I had a lot of fun. I think it's a good deal for the normal price at $3.99USD and one of the better deals on the VR Spring Sale on Steam for $1.59. \n\nThis is fast-paced arcade action shoot 'em up with arm-swing locomotion and the game also has some stealth portions. You have a gun on one hand and a shield on the other. Both gun and shield gun have reloads. So you do have to use your shield strategically when you can't dodge. You have to reload when it's safe to do so or you'll die. Everything dies in one shot, including you and enemies. There's some enemies that you have to place strategic shots though.\n\nI loved the stealth portion. Keep in mind, every part of this game is set pieces. So you traverse the map, but most of the action will go down exactly the same way. So with stealth as long as you memorize the patrols, it shouldn't be too hard to get by the enemies. Still it was fun for me to figure out where the hiding spots were and how to best get by the patrols.\n\nI was able to get finish the game with a 2 sensor setup, but I don't recommend that. I would definitely go full rooomscale. It'll be easier to run and gun that way. The graphics and sounds are not the best, but the gameplay is fast and fluid. This is definitely a purchase I am happy that I made during the Steam VR Spring Sale.\n\nSale Price Rating 8/10. Normal Price Rating 7/10.","timestamp_created":1524464180,"timestamp_updated":1524464180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545540571212768555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsqvJ+OICfpjrngE="}
