    short_description: Welcome to the unforgiving world ruled by the four Elder Fiends.
      Mankind as a whole is facing an unprecedented crisis that could lead to their
      total extinction. Having exhausted brave men in a war against the fiends, they
      now have no choice but to recruit the help of women to fight for their losing
      cause.

    review: I'm here from ED2 which i see as an awesome one, this one is somewhat
      harder and less recommended from me. only achievement i didn't get yet is get
      my character up to lv.100 because i hate level grinding but overall is fine.
      say, Pisaj's castle is probably even harder than the boss battle itself, some
      builds (like pure melee based) are mostly useless in later game, and most annoying
      enemies are regenerating enemies with high defense or high HP
