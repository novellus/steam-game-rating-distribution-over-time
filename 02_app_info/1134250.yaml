    review: "It tries with its background and graphics, but ultimately Hexadrift is\
      \ not much of a game, let alone a puzle game. At first it is a clicking slog\
      \ with minor challenge, in the middle it becomes a grind devoid of any challenge,\
      \ towards the end it is unbearable, to be finished only if you've somehow become\
      \ addicted. But why would you? Clickety-click without reason or rhyme gets you\
      \ through easy peasy, no planning or skill needed at all - (provided you heed\
      \ certain basic advice. If you don't heed that advice, on the other hand, you'll\
      \ never make it out of the initial slog phase. The sad thing about this unbalanced\
      \ mess is that with some thought or effort in level design it could have become\
      \ a much, much better game. \n\nIf you do want to give it a try because the\
      \ premise sounds intriguing - and it does - heed a third beginner's advice next\
      \ to the progression of upgrades (more credits, still more credits, more fuel)\
      \ and what to look for (fuel, then credits, ignore the rest) that is strangely\
      \ rarely given, even though it is just as important - and breaks the game: never\
      \ ever continue a level, always return to the base after reaching an exit. There\
      \ is no reason at all not to."
