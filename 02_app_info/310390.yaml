    review: "I like strategy games, Paradox strategy games, wargames, I like chess.\
      \ This game is one of my favorites in a row with Eador Genesis, Heroes III and\
      \ Civilization V.\n\nAt a scratch: Game is turn-based hex strategy sandbox.\
      \ You are playing as a chief of general staff. You can decide what basic units\
      \ to research and produce, how to combine those units into divisions. It is\
      \ also you, who leads these divisions into the battle. Sounds like more or less\
      \ standard, right?\n\nLooking like one of many this game feels special. I mean\
      \ not special features and abilities or special mechanics. Playing experience\
      \ does have a unique flavour, because first of all, this game de facto introduces\
      \ tactics, operational and strategy level of warfare.\n\nTactics means that\
      \ different landscapes are good to attack and defend, every unit is good against\
      \ some others\_and is obsolete for different ones, division composition really\
      \ matters (how many infantry should you place into tank division? Does\_it matter,\
      \ are you attacking through plains, paddies or forest?)\n\nOperational level\
      \ includes division cooperation. Those good in attack should attack, and those\
      \ good in defense should cover them. Versitiles will be average on both. Flack\
      \ should cover land formations, fighters should follow bombers for protection.\
      \ You definitely\_will need\_reserves, or will eventually run off \"ready to\
      \ fight\"\_divisions. Standard stuff, but it has a big depth here.\n\nAnd the\
      \ best of it - strategic level - includes deep breakthroughs, encirclement\_\
      operations, shore landings, bombing to the ground enemies production sites.\_\
      \n\nSome core mechanics, you should know:\_unit counters and division composition,\
      \ readiness, logistics. First is similar to any strategy game. Readiness concept\
      \ is more or less standard\_ too. It means that consecutive battles will drop\
      \ your division readiness and it would be weaker in combat to some (in this\
      \ game MUCH weaker) degree. These two mechanics define tactics and operational\
      \ level gameplay. \n\nThe last but not least is logistics mechanics: all your\
      \ units in all divisions need supply from head quarters. You need to produce\
      \ and distribute supply, If there is no supply, divisions will suffer readiness\
      \ drop. Sounds easy, but has dramatic consequences. If your army was cut off\
      \ from \"motherland\" you are in trouble. One or two turns, and ALL of encirclement\
      \ units will lose 30% of their combat potential each turn down to only 10%.\
      \ In no other game saw the same: you may struggle in tactics, take losses, even\
      \ lose some ground, but after one successful strategy cut off all goes upside\
      \ down and the whole enemy front disappears like a rabbit\_in a hat.\n\nThe\
      \ game has deep and complex mechanics, so your learning curve would be long\
      \ and sluggish. At some degree the game is intuitive\_(a miracle for such a\
      \ deep and logical wargame). Tanks are good against infantry, but suffer from\
      \ anti-tank guns. Hills and forests provide good entenchement, artillery barrage\
      \ before\_an attack\_is a good idea etc/ But you will need a lot of time to\
      \ master the game and to combine\_these simple principles into your indomitable\
      \ blitzkrieg.\_\_\n\nNow for the more obvious contra's. Game is somewhat ugly.\
      \ Only 2D, schematic\_drawings, crude buttons. I don't care all about that in\
      \ such a game, but have to admit that. The AI is also not good (still. there\
      \ are a lot of games\_with much worse). It is... \"artificial idiot\" with ridiculous\
      \ bonuses on top of it. Good player still overcomes him with ease (if not on\
      \ a plain with a lot of resources, where AI simply overproduces beyond any reasonable\
      \ level). In PBEM game man-with-man the game will shine at\_best.\n\nSo, if\
      \ you like strategy sandbox with deep mechanics and good replayability or do\
      \ have a friend, with whom you are ready to play a pbem strategy game, this\
      \ game is for you definitely. If you seek for more or less modern\_graphics,\
      \ competitive AI and historical accuracy, this game may disappoint\_you.\_"
