    about_the_game: "Wizard Warfare is a fantasy-themed, 4X-style, turn-based strategy\
      \ game with a strategic empire management layer supported by a detailed tactical\
      \ battle simulation layer. It is a game of exploration, conquest and magic.<br><br>The\
      \ focus is a 'retro' graphical style coupled with deep, complex gameplay mechanics\
      \ and heavy use of random/procedural generation to ensure extensive replayability.<br><br>The\
      \ goal of Wizard Warfare is to defeat all opposing enemy Wizards. Each Wizard\
      \ must settle and grow cities, build armies, hire spellcasters, research spells\
      \ and wage war until only one Wizard remains standing!<br><br>Wizard Warfare\
      \ consists of a strategic level (the World Map) and a tactical level (the Battle\
      \ Map). Exploration, expansion, production, research and city management all\
      \ happen on the World Map, while battles are simulated on the Battle Map.<br><br>Wizard\
      \ Warfare focuses extensively on replayability. Maps are generated randomly\
      \ from a variety of settings, although if you find a random map you like, it\
      \ can easily be regenerated from the same initial settings and random 'seed'\
      \ for use in future games.<br><br>With 3 distinct magical schools, 5 distinct\
      \ magical paths and over 200 fantasy-themed units, from tiny insects to massive\
      \ fire-breathing dragons, a huge variety of strategic and tactical options are\
      \ available. Playing as a Holy mage will be a very different experience to playing\
      \ as a Death mage!<br><br>The world of Wizard Warfare is hostile, with enemy\
      \ Wizards, neutral cities and rampaging monsters beyond your borders.<br><br>Wizards\
      \ start weak, with only a single city, a small military force, a few scouts\
      \ and very little research. Choosing priorities wisely is essential. Focusing\
      \ on exploration can yield crucial information about enemies\u2019 strengths\
      \ and weaknesses, and give early warning of attacks or reveal lucrative monster\
      \ lairs to capture. Focusing on magic and research leads to more powerful magical\
      \ spells which can overwhelm your enemies. Focusing on economic expansion can\
      \ lead to huge empires supporting massive armies in the late game. Focusing\
      \ on early military expansion can catch enemies by surprise if their attention\
      \ is elsewhere, but be careful not to overextend! No single strategy is guaranteed\
      \ to win every time.<br><br>It is not necessary to view every single battle\
      \ to win a game of Wizard Warfare. However, understanding how your troops perform\
      \ in different battle situations, along with their strengths and weaknesses\

    review: "A neat little cross between Civ and Dominions. If you want to experience\
      \ Dominions-style combat mechanics (where army composition and formations can\
      \ see you triumph over a numerically superior force) in a more familiar and\
      \ approachable context, this is your game. \n\nThere are some weaknesses: the\
      \ generic artstyle and game world hurt immersion, there aren't enough spells\
      \ or units per faction to give you a whole lot of depth, and the AI isn't great\
      \ at defending itself. But at a full price of $7 (and, c'mon, this is Steam;\
      \ there are always sales to take things below full price), it's worth picking\
      \ up to kill a few hours with."
