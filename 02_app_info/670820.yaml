      /><br><br>Civitatem is a medieval city builder where you help your villagers
      raise a new settlement in dangerous lands, by making use of their skills and
      available world resources. Shape the future of your people by managing and assigning
      the most skilled villager for each task. Educate them and research new technologies,
      fight off the natural elements or raiders, explore the land for new villages
      to develop new trades routes, acquire new technologies and develop diplomatic
      relations.<br><br>The most important resource are your villagers, each specialized
      in some areas, gaining experience each time they perform a task. Educate them
      in schools and libraries to allow them to perform more complex tasks and jobs.
      Besides education, the health of your people is imperative, so herbalists and
      doctors are also quite important. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/670820/extras/naturebar.png?t=1608647972"
      /><br><br>Nature has always had her way since the beginning of time, so be prepared

    review: I really enjoyed this game. It's obviously not quite finished, and some
      of the features were a little difficult to figure out how to use, but that didn't
      spoil my enjoyment of the game. I'm a huge fan of Rimworld, and while this game
      isn't nearly as polished as Rimworld I found it enjoyable in many of the same
      ways. This game represented a very good value for the price.
