    review: '[h1]EGO PROTOCOL[/h1]


      [i]Game does not function as it suppose to, the  jump button does not work.
      I went through 16 minutes of tutorial and tried a few levels, I was not able
      to jump gaps or bombs, which was enough for me to ask for a refund.[/i]


      [i]Game looks great sure, but if these functions dont work properly then game
      is unplayable IMHO thank you and sorry for negative review here.[/i]'
