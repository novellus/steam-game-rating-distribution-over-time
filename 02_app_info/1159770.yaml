    review: "RaceXXL is a decently fun game, but gets boring quick without other players\
      \ or AI\n\nPros: \n- Decent handling physics, doesn't feel clunky\n- Foreground\
      \ visuals are cool\n- Entertaining when getting wrecked by different obstacles,\
      \ but that only lasts so long (see cons)\n\n\nCons:\n- No AI or other players\
      \ even though game photos show you racing with another vehicle. That doesn't\
      \ happen, at least not \n  for the first 3 races, which was enough to turn me\
      \ off from continuing playing.\n- Background visuals are a bit cheesy but I\
      \ can't complain for a 6$ game\n- No purpose other than collecting coins and\
      \ getting to the finish, \"racing\" is a very loose way to describe this. At\
      \ least \n   needs AI to race against.\n \nVideo of gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjZx09aBqqc\n\
      \nOverall I wouldn't keep playing unless there were AI vehicles in each race.\
      \ \n\nFor $6 it's whatever but don't expect to keep playing it for a long time!\n"
