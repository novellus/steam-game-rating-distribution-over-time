I have been playing for about three months and I am mixed about the game. It appears at times some are \"cheating\" but now the more I ask questions during the time waiting for a battle to start in the chat box I am learning a small bit at a time. There is little to explain how player seem to make impossible shots time after time; I do not understand how they are doing this. Forexample, using a 1 minute smoke seems to make little difference. I am some how still in view of the \"enemy\" team and sunk. I am unable to see past the smoke but they seem to be unaffected. \nSo, I have frustrations but all and all it appears that a lot of attention and effort was put into the game which causes me to give a positive review.\nthank you,","timestamp_created":1487649712,"timestamp_updated":1487649712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+KS1r9oCernbcg=="}
