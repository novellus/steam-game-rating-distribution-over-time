    review: "Aztaka brings old school, side-scrolling slash, bash, upgrade and backtrack\
      \ action in a setting befitting of the game's title.  I passed over this one\
      \ for years and only got to it recently.  It looked awesome but the few people\
      \ that I talked to that played it were pretty lukewarm on the game.  Well, you\
      \ can sacrifice me to Quetzalcoatl because once I finally got to this one, I\
      \ thought it was a blast!  \n\nThe plot's simple; you're one of your civilization's\
      \ most able warriors and it's up to you to save everybody else by finding the\
      \ mystical items necessary to put a stop to evil.  Of the slew of Metroid/Castlevania/Megaman\
      \ homages I've went through over the last couple of years, Aztaka had some of\
      \ my favorite art design of all of 'em.  The detailed backgrounds, variety of\
      \ ruins/temples/forests/caverns/wastelands that you explore, the barrage of\
      \ beasties you must fight (including bosses) and the different powers you wield\
      \ all are rendered great.  It's a classic SNES/Genesis look but with a new set\
      \ of paint on the hood.  The soundtrack also features a few memorable tunes\
      \ that will get stuck in your head as you wield brute force and magic on your\
      \ way to the evil warlord you must vanquish who wants the 7 phonograph relics\
      \ that you seek for his own dastardly desires.  \n\nYou'll explore high and\
      \ low, earn experience by beating the tar out of each area's unique foe roster,\
      \ do some puzzling and figuring out where to go, find items that you need to\
      \ progress or backtrack with and basically do all of the tried n' true formula\
      \ things that you expect in this type of game.  The packaging of the audio/visual\
      \ world is certainly gorgeous and something different but if you were hoping\
      \ for something that completely reinvents the type of experience I'm describing\
      \ then you are barking up the wrong ancient pillar.  \n\n...And that is perhaps\
      \ Aztaka's biggest flaw; it's only the setting that is unique.  Everything else\
      \ is EXACTLY what you would expect in a game of this type.  It doesn't detract\
      \ from the overall experience, it's just a matter of how much Metroidvania can\
      \ YOU handle?  Whether that's a flaw of the game or a strong point is in your\
      \ hands to decide.  At the time I purchased this, it was exactly the kind of\
      \ game I was hoping it would be and had a lot of fun beating it.  It also controlled\
      \ well on PC and I didn't have any problems with glitches or bugs for an older\
      \ game on Steam.  Aztaka is solid like an ancient Aztec ruin, through and through.\
      \  \n\n"
