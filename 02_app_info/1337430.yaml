      /><br>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to date someone without any
      idea of their gender or appearance? Or maybe you date without gender or appearance
      as a main focus. In any case, this game simulates the same experience! The player
      is shown 5 colors, each of which with different personalities. The goal is to
      figure out as much about these colors before choosing which one to date. Next,
      you will answer situational questions before being shown the physical appearance
      of your partner and a prediction of how the relationship will work out. Each
      character has 3 unlockable gallery images.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1337430/extras/Features_2.0.png?t=1603943463"

      Impactful choices.<br><br>- Meaningful conversations with each personality.<br><br>-
      Custom responses.<br><br>- Discover the unique motives of potential partners.<br><br>-
      Entertaining interactions between the different personalities.<br><br>- A relaxing

    review: "[h1]Cool concept, but I wish it had gone deeper.  For $1.50 it wasn't\
      \ bad.[/h1]\n\nI liked it!  I found the characters surprisingly three dimensional\
      \ for such a short, cheap game (although they still weren't super complex).\
      \  \n\nI found the ability to enter in our own responses interesting in theory,\
      \ but lacking in practice, a) because the responses the characters give back\
      \ are (obviously) canned, and b) you get the same questions over and over again,\
      \ so there's not a point to typing your responses more than once.  It would\
      \ have been more interesting if the game gave different prompts per character,\
      \ or if there were a bigger selection of random prompts any character could\
      \ give you, so you have more incentive to actually use that mechanic throughout\
      \ the game.\n\nI also think that the game missed an opportunity to have a story,\
      \ which I think would have enhanced the overall experience.  Online dating seems\
      \ like an obvious backdrop this game could have used, for example.\n\nOverall\
      \ I think the game is worth $1.50, but I personally would have preferred it\
      \ to be longer/more involved, and cost a little more."
