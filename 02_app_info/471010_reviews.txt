Although the game was made by industry veterans, their studio (Fool's Theory) is otherwise quite small with a presumably small budget to match. Nevertheless, their debut title proves surprisingly ambitious, with it being inspired by an eclectic mix of various genre staples and guided by uncompromising vision. \n\nAlthough gameplay mechanics are largely derived from traditional stealth games such as \"Thief\" and \"Dishonored,\" the game takes place in a fairly large open world containing both a lengthy main quest as well as dozens of side quests. With a top-down isometric perspective, its presentation feels akin to classic CRPGs such as \"Divinity\" and \"Neverwinter\" which, when combined with its fully real-time stealth and combat, makes it all the more novel. \n\nFinally, the narrative, while suffering from some shoddy translation errors, creates a believable yet fantastical post-apocalyptic world characterized by political power struggles, reverence for ancient beings, rogue AI, technology-powered magic, widespread fear of said technology-powered magic, and one snarky British-sounding thief (the player character) who acts like a cross between Geralt (from \"The Witcher\") and Garrett (from \"Thief\"). \n\nAlthough the game suffers from a general lack of polish, a lack of likable characters beyond the main one, awkward combat, inconsistent quest quality, and poor optimization; the game's intricate level design, hardcore stealth gameplay, and well-realized world make it my most recent favorite.\n\nAlso I beat the game and still have no idea why it's titled \"Seven.\"","timestamp_created":1610101124,"timestamp_updated":1610101124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuq3g8PYCcsTAwQI="}
