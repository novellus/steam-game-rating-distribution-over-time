      /><br>Take control of PMC General Yulana Carter in a combination Stealth/Action
      2D adventure. Explore an alien world filled with intelligent life as well as
      the brutal Nekril, a devout cyborg race that wishes to assimilate all life forms
      and claim dominance throughout the universe.<br><br>Features:<br><br><br><img

      /><br>Armor is not tied to stats so the player can feel free to customize the
      look without impeding on builds. Complete challenges and gain standing with
      different factions to unlock the ability to craft new looks.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/909360/extras/CosmeticBanner.jpg?t=1587504975"
      /><br>Horizontal Progression: As challenges become harder, Carter becomes diverse
      with new options rather than gaining raw power. This allows player intelligence
      and skill to be in the spotlight over raw fire power. Customize a build to optimize
      your ability to take on challenges at the expense of other attributes.<br><br>Edits
