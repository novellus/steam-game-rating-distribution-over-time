As a matter of fact, every asset in the game is from the Unity asset store because I'm a solo developer that doesn't have a team of highly trained specialized individuals at my disposal.\n\t\n\tIf the game crashes for you, you should give me some more details either at the email address listed on the store page or on the game's Discord because you're the first person out of all of my players that's mentioned it and I'd like to get it fixed if it is indeed actually crashing.\n\t\n\tThe AI is rough, everything currently has basic AI, I haven't gotten to the point of adding in custom AI for each species yet.  Though dinosaur AI does sometimes sprint, just in 20 minutes of play you aren't going to see much happen in the way of AI, features, or gameplay because its a little bit of a longer-term game at the moment.\n\t\n\tYou gain growth in two ways.  One, passively over time, the longer you play the more growth happens just in case you have a hard time finding food.  Number two, food, eating, makes you grow depending on what you've eaten.  Some things give you more growth than others.  For herbivores there are common, uncommon, and rare plants and the rarer a plant is the more growth points it gives you.  Also, plants in different biomes are worth different amounts of points so it may be worthwhile to travel to another area to sample the plants and see if they are more nutritious.  Carnivores, each dinosaur species gives a different amount of growth points, the tougher and bigger a dinosaur is the more growth points it will give you.  Also with carnivores, a fresh corpse is worth twice as many points compared to left over meat from an old corpse.\n\t\n\tThe parent AI comes to your assistance if you call for help when something is either attacking you or chasing you and to call for help you press the '1' key on the keyboard, which will make your dinosaur do a vocal call and get your parent, or any of your nearby species' assistance (unless your species is a non-social species).\n\n\tThe reason grass gets in front of the camera as a hatchling is because you're a hatchling, you're very small when you start the game if you haven't unlocked accelerated growth stages to play as.\n\n\tI am a caring developer, I've liked dinosaurs for 30+ years, and have wanted to make a dinosaur game like this for 20 or more years.  Finally being able to make a game in Unity I went for it and started working on the project I've always wanted to make.\n\t\n\tAnyway, thanks for showing support for my project by becoming a customer.  I hope you do eventually find enjoyment out of my game, I do update the game a lot.  Maybe something I do will get it to be more suited to players like you."}],"cursor":"AoJw85ql2vYCdu+avgI="}
