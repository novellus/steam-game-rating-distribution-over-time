    review: At normal price I do not recommend this game. For two dollars sure. I
      don't know why we cant rebind controls as on keyboard the control set up is
      a bit uncomfortable. As someone else has said controlling all the players at
      once does not make sense for this game. Your opponents are able to strategically
      place their players while you are basically stuck controlling one. It is very
      hard to position your teammates for a shot or a pass while also trying to fend
      off the entire opposing team. Really fun concept and I wish the devs could just
      fix those few problems. Those chances are slim considering it appears they've
      moved past this little hobby
