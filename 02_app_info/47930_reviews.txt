The ability to create realistic and functional stables and equestrian facilities is a feature I've never seen in any of the \"serious\" horsie games, especially if you utilize some of the numerous high-quality mods that are available on the internet. Within the same vein is the horse customization and genetics. While not necessarily realistic, I enjoy the way the game passes down the phenotype of the parents to the foal.\n\nThe other pets are fun too, and there are so many \"minor\" pets to choose from including parrots that you can train, but if you collect too many it will definitely slow your progression because they take so much time just like they do in real life. My suggestion for overcoming that is add another Sim to your household whose only job is to care for the pets. While it's always great to get a DLC that's on sale, this is one I don't feel bad about paying full price for.","timestamp_created":1609756834,"timestamp_updated":1609756834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjf++5vYCfIytwAI="}
