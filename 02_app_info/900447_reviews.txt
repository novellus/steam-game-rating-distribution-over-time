That is, if you happen to lose bartholomew (gets himself two-shot if you don't rush to his aid) and miss the gnome (appears in a random area you're never told about and vanishes forever after finishing a certain quest)[/spoiler]. Without this, you basically can't win. Extremely frustrating. Do I recommend the DLC? Well, the content is good. I just wish it was part of the base game since the game is designed in such a way that it can become mandatory if you don't follow a walkthrough.","timestamp_created":1603588577,"timestamp_updated":1603588577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47vrUrvUCcPL4qQI="}
