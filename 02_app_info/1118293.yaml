    about_the_game: The Killarney circuit is located in Cape Town and was added to
      the WRX calendar in 2017. The inaugural race was won by Johan Kristoffersson
      for PSRX, after the notably action packed Semi Finals and Finals. The track
      features a fast and wide first corner, which tightens into a tricky technical
      section, a large jump and an ultra fast chicane at the end of the lap.
