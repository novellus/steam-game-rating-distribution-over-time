Although SONAR's version comes with the Rhythm Machines for 404, 707, 808 and 909, after adding Digital Sound Factory electronic kit, you have a much richer set of sounds. For instance, Addictive Drum set 'Reel Machines' only has samples for the major components of these rhythm machines, such as: kick, snare, closed hihat, toms, crash cymbals and clap. This set is even easy to load into Rapture Pro and tweak some of the sounds even further. Well worth the asking price...","timestamp_created":1483803951,"timestamp_updated":1483803951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538198411464691162","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+e/mvNkCerP8bg=="}
