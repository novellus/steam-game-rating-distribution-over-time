    developer_response: 'Thank you for the feedback - while it''s obviously not the
      kind we hope for, we do appreciate constructive criticism and will definitely
      take it into consideration in future projects.


      We are looking into replicating and fixing the "invisible wall" bug, however
      we''d like to point out that it only occurs in an isolated situation. As a temporary
      solution, restarting the level should remedy it. The game is most certainly
      beatable.


      The AI is a much more subjective discussion, but it does indeed follow its own
      rules, and there is a reason they behave the way the do. This is primarily a
      horror game rather than a "traditional" platformer.'

    review: 'don''t buy this. save youe money.

      platforming is terrible, the collison detection is terrible, the check points
      are ridcuulously placed, and the worst part pf all, you cant even beat the game.
      a certain part in chapter 6 or 7 has a spot that gets an invisible wall after
      you die a single time, and you can;t go back where you came form.


      so enjoy that,

      add to it AI that doesnt make sense, that doesnt follow it''s own rules, sometimes
      these zombies things attack me, sometimes they don''t . who knows why. the dev
      did a poor job at just abotu everything in this game, and it didn''t surprise
      me in the least to see I was the literal only person to even post in the discussions
      about it 3 months after it came out.


      avoid this at all cost. i only wish I played it sooner, to find out what garbage
      it all is.
