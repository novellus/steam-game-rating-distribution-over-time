This is what eventually makes the game highly replayable.\n\nBy the way, I recommend playing it with a friend (either in couch co-op or Remote Play Together). The characters have different strengths and personalities and combining them doubles the fun.\n\nThe only low points of this experience are the fact that the lore and history bits (otherwise welcome within the game) often interrupt the action and that not all levels have been cleared of bugs.","timestamp_created":1604093970,"timestamp_updated":1609676954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmaOO5PYCdJyUqwI="}
