    review: 'Even though Alder''s Blood is rough around the edges (game-design-wise,
      mostly), the game has a lot of heart in it.

      The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and the world seems to hold enough mysteries
      for you to reveal.

      Go play it, if you''re a sucker for grim Bloodborne-ish stories!'
