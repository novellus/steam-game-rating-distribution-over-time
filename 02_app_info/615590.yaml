    review: "I've played the work in progress version of this game at NGDC 2016, and\
      \ they have improved a lot on the environment.\n\nThings I like about Solaright\
      \ is that it sends the green message of 'connecting the world with Solar power,'\
      \ and the peaceful musical experience it offers. The sliding mechanics on multiple\
      \ faces of the cube is unique, and rotating the cube in Vive's virtual environment\
      \ feels amazing with the overall design of this game. \n\nI just love the puzzle,\
      \ and it gets challenging over the period. I wish there were a little more variation\
      \ with the sliding tiles mechanics, but for the price, I think its a good game.\
      \ And if you love playing puzzle games on any platform, you will just love Solaright!\n"
