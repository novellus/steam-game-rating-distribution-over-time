While not all the assets (mainly just the sound effects when picking up items, hitting enemies, and using explosives) are original, I still see great potential in Necesse. Don't let this game fly under your radar, it has a distinct feel to it and should not be underestimated from its outward appearance. I look forward to what the full release of the game has to offer.","timestamp_created":1609353611,"timestamp_updated":1609353611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47+i82vYCcuLtvgI="}
