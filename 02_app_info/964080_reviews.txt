You must make sure that you have the appearance adjusted to appearance and not performance or else it will not work. The max fps for the wallpaper is 60 and you can run it no problem as long as you have a gpu above 1gb. But if you have a gpu with only 4gb you wont be able to run a decent game while the wallpaper is in the background. Everything a max settings takes up around 2Gb of Vram in your gpu. So if you have a lower end gpu dont use it while playing games. I'm having trouble with repairing the ship function. I click it and it doesn't seem to work. The only big downside to this is when you exit the picture stays on your screen and you have to log out in order to reset it. But overall this is a great wallpaper.","timestamp_created":1609511625,"timestamp_updated":1609511625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ksyX3/YCdvu0vwI="}
