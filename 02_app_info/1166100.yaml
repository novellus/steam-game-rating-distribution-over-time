    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/T9qmyDGv0ZM\n\nI don't\
      \ like to refund games and it's been a while since I have done that. However,\
      \ this game was just so dull to me. I thought this was actually an arm swinger\
      \ locomotion type game. Instead, you have full locomotion with snap turning.\
      \ I normally like full locomotion, but in this type of game, I think you need\
      \ an arm-swinger to bring some immersion to the challenge.\n\nThe graphics are\
      \ basic and so is the gameplay. The music is pretty bad. I did the first few\
      \ levels and was just bored playing this game. It does get more difficult the\
      \ further you get, but it's just such an ugly, clunky game that it's difficult\
      \ to get motivated to continue playing. \n\nI played for as long as I could.\
      \ I had to tap out. This is a .99 cents mobile VR quality game at best. \n\n\
