    short_description: Wizard's Academy is a co-operative game of magical experimentation
      for 1-6 players. In each game, the players select a scenario, such as summoning
      and binding a demon to steal its powers, defending the academy against an attack
      by an army of Imps, or (in the most difficult scenario) facing an academy inspector
      whom they must impress with...

    review: 'I wasn''t impressed with this one. The premise of the game is that you
      are clueless wizardry students trying to defend your magical academy while your
      teacher''s are away. Many a threat or problem will arise that you will have
      to use your spells to tackle - spells of which you have no idea what they will
      do. Unfortunately the cluelessness doesn''t end there as the rulebook is just
      as clueless in telling you how the play the game and the rest of the board isn''t
      all that helpful!


      Direction is key in any boardgame and like many of the failures of Tabletop
      Simulator''s DLC, it comes from their rulebooks....


      I won''t say it is the worst DLC I''ve played, I did have fun playing it. But
      it isn''t one I recommend either.'
