      are probably not going to make it. Not the first time, not the second, but perhaps
      the 100th? Every round is different, and you'll get better over time, so crack
      your knuckles and show those alien beasts who's the master of vehicular arts,
      the ultimate escaper of Earth, the unintended interdimensional time traveler
      scientist-man of pure vehiculative efficiency! Or, get struck by a bus and try

    short_description: Switchcars is a vehicular roguelike arcade set in a broken
      spacetime. Escape alien beasts over procedural environments, using more than
      1,000 vehicles. You'll crash or run out of fuel, but that's okay - you'll switch
      to another vehicle. All you need to do is reach the year 2055. In theory!

    review: 'This game is insanely fast paced and the retro nostalgic feel and sound
      effects really brings you into the experience.  You get to see the best of each
      time period from the old times all the way up to the future.  Each vehicle and
      upgrades have its own benefits.  Interacting with the different environments
      is also fun and also unpredictable.  Do not see all of that in your typical
      video game.


      But wait a moment here... WHATS ALL THIS? FLYING AND FLOATING CARS!?  within
      a decade the human race turns into some sort of unrealistic fantasy world, nor
      do they contribute many benefits over others.  ITS NOT TO LATE TO REMOVE THEM!
      UGH.  People in a few years from now is going to look back at this and die of
      laughter


      This game has so much potential but it is in need of new content.  Small details
      like this can add to a already incredible game, if no one is going to say it
      then I will.  Additional improvements can be to add buildings that only appear
      in certain time periods.  For a example, in the future have futuristic buildings,
      in the past have past.  Second be to have different day and night time instead
      of it being nothing than daytime most of the time.  Finally all of the other
      citizens who appear in the background all are identical and have no traits specific
      to them and when you enter a vehicle you actually become them no one else exits.


      I hope the developers do not give up on this project and is well worth the price.'
