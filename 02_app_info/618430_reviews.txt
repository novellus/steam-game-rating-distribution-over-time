Mediocre art. Poor writing and characters that were actively offputting. A few interesting threads in the story which hint at future improvement, but which can't really elevate the present experience. I should be giving this a \"not recommended\" but I feel bad doing so for something that skirts the edge and has so few reviews.\n\nTechnical details / Presentation: no technical concerns. The art is mostly meh, except for a couple things: 1 character's sprite cuts off at her knees, so there's a visible gap between her and the bottom of the screen. Second, every single CG (or simply non-sprite image) of a given character looks completely different (the MC's sprite looks completely different from the the three other images of him, which all look completely different from each other). It's a little jarring. Music is pretty listenable, though nothing really sticks out about it.\n\nGameplay: It's a VN. There are a few choices here and there, but they tend to lead swiftly to an untimely death, so you're almost always on the right path. It's mostly kinetic.\n\nStory: This VN is hard to pin down. The store page mentions Fate/Stay Night; this is basically shonen turned up to eleven. The main character is an edgelord orbited by women who love him even though he's mostly an a-hole to them. Up until about 2/3rds in it seems like every single interaction the MC has ends with words and people fighting. The MC has super powers, which is fine I guess, but almost every battle involves him pulling a new ability out of his butt that hasn't shown up before--and even better, he and several others say their attacks out loud when they perform them. He frequently fights off dozens of people at a time, and the climax takes this to the point of absurdity.\n\nThe writing is very clumsy. There's a fair number of typos, but the syntax itself is painful sometimes--sometimes just poorly written, sometimes painfully video game, sometimes embarrassingly edgy. At one point I encountered the line, \"The men nod and I find myself amused.\" Another: \"I can't even grasp the mindsword to use it, even though it's equipped\" (and no, the \"mindsword\" was never introduced). Yet another: \"These two swords represent the Night and Day in you. Your Alpha and Omega. Your Yin and Yang.\"\n\nAt the same time, it does do a couple interesting things. At the very beginning of the game the MC has an encounter with another character. This moment kicks something off that shows up periodically through the game, but is never explained. It's always interesting when it shows up. And the structure of the story works well. To get to the \"true\" end you have to finish a couple of routes for specific characters, then go back and pick different choices. One of those choices was kind of interesting, in the direction it seemed to be pushing the MC.\n\nAll in all, if you can stomach (or [i]like[/i]) some majorly chuuni BS, this game is worth your time. Otherwise, probably best to avoid.","timestamp_created":1587447140,"timestamp_updated":1587447204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507462680339813232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwisHOzfECcuqyggI="}
