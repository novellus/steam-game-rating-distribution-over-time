After making some prototypes I realised that 90x45 was viable and set about making something that would be fun to play in such a small amount of pixels... and so Alpha Dog was born! I've always loved arena shooters, and the small play area lent itself nicely to this kind of casual shooter game. I've packed as much as possible into the tiny space available and I hope you enjoy playing it! Remember, it's not the size that counts, but what you do with it... ;)","about_the_game":"<strong>As a criminal on death row you can choose... Die quietly or die in the Alpha Dog dungeon!
