( In all seriousness it's a pretty good visual novel and a fantastic story) I feel like this visual novel is on par with Crystalline which is one of my favourite visual novels that I have read. It also reminds me of Spice and Wolf. When I heard the opening song of this Visual Novel I knew I was going to be in for a treat. I loved the soundtrack of this visual novel and the art was fantastic. This Visual Novel also has a lot of good emotional moments and there are not a lot of visual novels that I could say made me feel moved in a emotional way before. The only thing about this visual novel is that it is a shame this visual novel wasn't fully voiced but it doesn't stop it from being a really good visual novel and story..                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxwcQ1dapw8","timestamp_created":1590914478,"timestamp_updated":1606364208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619165897369384766","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuJOxgfYCcKytiwI="}
