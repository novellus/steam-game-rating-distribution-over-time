      (Mathieu Stempell) interest in music grew from synthesised 8/16 bit computer

      current passion is composing music on Atari ST's, and other old-skool systems.

      as musical instruments. Running Little Sound DJ software on 4 gameboys simultaneously
      has earned him a name for live performances.  Despite working towards a $12,000
