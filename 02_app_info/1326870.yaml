      far away...</i><br><br>Just kidding<br><br>But imagine yourself standing in
      magnet boots on top of the spaceship, overlooking a galaxy, equipped with 2
      energysabers with built-in rail-guns, hearing this alien synth sound alarming
      you about the drones coming up in different shapes and styles. Be the masta
      of your sabers and your people. Protect yourself and protect them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game-play
      and features</h2>You will appear on an alien spaceship with two energysabers
      in your hands in deep space somewhere in a faraway galaxy. You can use your
      energysabers as sabers, shields, or even rail-guns to fight with incoming flying
      and crawling drones. The drones are coming in waves and you will lose some health
      every time a drone hits you. The health is restored after each completed wave.
      In order to complete a wave you need to kill all the drones in it, and each
      subsequent wave has an increased number of drones. Every drone in a new wave
      becomes more and more tricky to kill: faster, closer to appear, harder to hit.
      They can also carry some hidden drones inside and split when you expect that
      the least.<h2 class="bb_tag">Physical and mind activities</h2>- 360 arm swings<br>-
