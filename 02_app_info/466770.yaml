    review: 'Seriously extremely fun and underrated game.


      Can be played with many players online (with quite the good system, defeating
      the current human player will net you gray crystals, once you have more than
      anyone else you become the human for the next round).

      Even playing from EU with people from West US there was no noticable lag or
      anything. Absolutely amazing.


      Very impressed. Can only say for ~ 4 Dollars/EURO with online multiplayer AND
      level editor, this is a steal.
