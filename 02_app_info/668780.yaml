    review: "[b] The Puppet of Tersa (episode 1) [/b] - is a lighthearted point&click\
      \ adventure that takes about 2 hours to complete, although it's obviously not\
      \ a finished story. I would compare the tone of this game to something like\
      \ [i]Anna's Quest [/i], it has that dark fantasy theme going, but it's a kid\
      \ friendly game in general. That being said, the store page should be updated\
      \ to inform us about the nature of the episodes (is it free or paid DLC?). I\
      \ bought several episodic adventure games that never got finished, so that is\
      \ something to consider when you buy a game in parts. I have played through\
      \ the first episode and it was above average when it comes to this genre, but\
      \ I did run into couple of glitches. So far the devs were very fast with the\
      \ patches, fixing achievements and updating the puzzles on the first day. They\
      \ were open to feedback back in the demo, even including a few of my ideas,\
      \ so I don't have any reason to believe that game won't improve.\n\nWhen it\
      \ comes to adventure games I am looking for good narrative, fun characters,\
      \ immersive soundtrack and intuitive puzzles. This game has at least 3 of the\
      \ 4, the puzzles being a bit sketchy. I think about 80% of the puzzles in this\
      \ game were designed well, the other 20% need a little bit of 'intuitive' rework.\
      \ For example, you might figure out an obvious solution to the puzzle, you might\
      \ even have a correct item for it, but you missed a line of dialogue which is\
      \ required to progress. So make sure that you talk to all of the characters\
      \ multiple times, and they could have new options between the puzzles. You can\
      \ also show items to your hungry companion which may or may not give you a clue.\
      \ Aside from that, I very much enjoyed the story from start to finish. It has\
      \ a creative world, characters with cool personalities and a few decent jokes.\n\
      \n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ enjoyable dialogue & characters\n+ beautiful environments\
      \ & soundtrack\n+ most of the puzzles were very creative\n+ achievements \n\n\
      [h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- I had a few small glitches\n- a few puzzles could use\
      \ intuitive updates \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts (episode 1): 7/10 [/b]\n\nThe game\
      \ is unpolished at the time of this review but the developer has been responding\
      \ to issues very quickly, so I would not discourage anyone from buying it. I\
      \ think episode 1 was pretty good aside from technical problems, if they manage\
      \ to finish the story I would be happy to play more.\n\n[code]For more Hidden-Gems:\
