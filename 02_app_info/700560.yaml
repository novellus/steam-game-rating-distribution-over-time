    review: "This game was nothing about druidism.. Just a click bait, fun the first\
      \ hour and then you search for more things... =( Not worth the price tag! \n\
      It handles worse than anything without VR set. But don't support it straight\
      \ away x'D \n\nI wanted a refund but it was too late, I had to google and research\
      \ about this game on how to decode all sigil's and marks but nothing I had to\
      \ spend more time writing things down since the game was \"SOO helpful\" with\
      \ having a in game notebook.....Best druid ever without his own notebook..\n\
      \nBut there are NO instructions inside the game, No tutorial. No guide in the\
      \ steam community..\nSo you start of with a briefing and rest you figure out,\
      \ including how things work. How to slay the ghost for example. When he took\
      \ 40 hits in his face\n(Which can bug and become immortal so you need to start\
      \ entire save file over from start in order to get rid of the ghost sometimes..\
      \ ) \n\nYou are just being told things very short and bad, without more info\
      \ on what things mean, and what they do.. and again (Or how the mark or sigil\
      \ look like but you have to guess and have a notebook next to you irl, So you\
      \ write down things more than actually playing the game....)\n\nImpossible to\
      \ sort things because when you came back for a 3 or 5'th time all your mushrooms\
      \ got mixed with other stuff, and mushrooms mix with others.\nWhat is the point\
      \ to not add a track code of Item ID ?\n\nSo you need a VR set to play a game\
      \ made by 1 person since moving things around is more mouse scrolling than enjoying\
      \ the world outside that door with boring tasks written on it.\n\nI bought this\
      \ game since I am polish my self, I am a Shaman Druid and a coder also.\nBut\
      \ to see this that gives motion sickness, and Claustrophobia due to a super\
      \ small world to play in. But now I regret it and steam don't want to refund.\
      \ \n\nThis game is fun first 20 minutes.. but as soon as you try to use the\
      \ sword and it bugs soon and fly's away from your hand. \n\nThis game ain't\
      \ worth what they creator ask for, This teaches you VERY little or nothing about\
      \ the druidic path. (I would hope it would go through basics which is ALOT of\
      \ Animism and Shamanic knowledge before brewing potions..)\n\nThe 11 hours I\
      \ spent on this game was not worth it as for 11 hours of meditation taught me\
      \ much more while having contact with a spirit guide. this game didn't even\
      \ offer teaching you on how you gain connection with other worlds, how to meditate\
      \ wasn't even taught... \nThis game is a joke on it's name and what it could\
      \ have been. \n\n(Like it was hard to create a spirit guide that manifest's\
      \ from like 8 or 12 different animals (power animals!) and this guide will show\
      \ the druid how to find things, what certain things mean and can happen, Even\
      \ working as a companion for company.)"
