    review: 'A BASS PLAYER''s review


      This review is aimed at bass players and those who will primarly want this pack
      to play bass.


      The pack contains 4 songs by Social Distortion which are all played in Eb (E
      flat) tunning with a pick.


      This is a pack I can only recommend to players still learning and wanting to
      consolidate their faster rythm bass playing or aspire to play some more punk.
      None of the songs are very challenging, but they would be great for a learner
      as they only contain the occasional slide, hammer or flick.


      While most rocksmith packs seem to contain songs varying in difficulty, this
      one does not really have any song that stand out as being much easier or much
      harder. On bass, Ball and Chain and Bad Luck are easier than Reach of the Sky
      and Story of my Life, but only marginaly.


      I think this is actually a great pack if you want to reinforce your punk bass
      playing, and you''ll have 4 songs to do so which will allow you not to get sick
      of any one song. Outside of that, I can''t really recommend it for players who
      are more advanced and don''t want to play songs with more variance in it.'
