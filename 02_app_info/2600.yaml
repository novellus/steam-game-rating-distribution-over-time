      \ of RPG experience-one that blends all the core elements of a traditional RPG\
      \ with the graphical richness, immediacy and brutal combat of a first-person\
      \ action game. The game plunges players into the dark and gritty vampire underworld\
      \ of modern-day L.A. as a creature of the night. Players will develop their\
      \ character's powers, interact with other characters and embark on story-driven\
      \ quests as they battle mortals and other vampires with an incredible array\
      \ of vampire powers and weapons. Powered by Valve's Source Technology, the game\
      \ is based on White Wolf's popular Vampire: The Masquerade pen-and-paper RPG\
      \ series and its official clans."
