    about_the_game: A simple trip to the doctor has turned the life of Theodore Caldwell
      upside down. While attempting to seek help for both his addiction and mental
      health, Theodore has found himself in the hands of a rather questionable individual.
      Dr. Blazier from ECCO (The Electro-Convulsive and Cognitive Therapy Organization)
      promises Theodore that everything will be routine when in fact something more
      sinister appears to transpire. Quickly after, Theo realizes that the situation
      is not in his favor as he has to learn how to deal with some entities that do
      not appear to be the most friendly in nature. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1233580/extras/KrisGif.gif?t=1582999060"
      /><br><br>Fast reflexes, attention to detail, and a steady hand may help Theodore
      escape this new dilemma. What is this new environment he finds himself in? Why
      is he trapped here with no way out? Who are these other entities that seem to
      want to keep him here? Can Theodore survive long enough to escape this dark
      situation that he now finds himself stuck in?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1233580/extras/CooperGifSocial.gif?t=1582999060"
      /><br><br>Smile is a first person horror game that utilizes time management
      and fear of the unknown, along with semi-difficult gameplay, in order to create
      a truly haunting experience. A deeper story that is open to interpretation leaves
      the player wondering why we are truly here and if there is really any way to
      escape.
