Lore is entertaining and lighthearted, visuals are really nice while soaring although if you look too closely at things like your characters face, it's a little weird. \n\nThere's plenty to do for the price, 40+ races to test your skills, loads of things to collect, armour sets and locations to discover and read about. Clearly some love has been put into this game, it's sad to see it go unnoticed. \n\nI hope a couple more updates come in the future although I fully understand if not, still enough to play with for Â£11. \n\nOne issue which stands out to me right now is; I can't seem to find the \"disable low poly clouds\" option.","timestamp_created":1601515330,"timestamp_updated":1601515330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnZPw8PQCcZKPpQI="}
