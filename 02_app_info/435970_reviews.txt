As a result, the gameplay may feel rather \"stiff\" – I enjoyed learning the system and routing the stages, but it might not be for everyone.\n\nVisuals, music and patterns are great; and the lore was interesting too.","timestamp_created":1609915186,"timestamp_updated":1609915186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtYeb6/YCcbn2wAI="}
