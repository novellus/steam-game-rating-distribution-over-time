It's similar to Invisible Inc's DLC, Contingency Plan - it adds a new game mode, it adds new programs and twists to the game, and it's only for experienced players who have beaten the game at least once.\n\nThe new mode, Plan B, gives a global modifier to the game - an enemy type has extra HP, all money turns invisible, your laser works backwards - so there's a twist to every run.\n\nI'd say this is worth it if you love the base game and want more.","timestamp_created":1535884718,"timestamp_updated":1535884718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596482157707214355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+533zOUCe+LtqQE="}
