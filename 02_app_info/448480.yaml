    review: 'Caravanserail is extremely short with only 10 levels.  The first several
      levels add new functions for game play and objectives but most of the game play
      is extremely repetitive.  If you like resource buying/selling games you will
      probably enjoy this but I wouldn''t recommend buying it at full price.  The
      menu graphics are cute but most of the graphics are minimal.  Backgrounds are
      also minimal but depict generic looking desert scenes or small towns.


      With only 10 short levels and not enough variety in gameplay I can''t really
      bring myself to recommend this game unless you really love buying/selling resource
      games or like me just collect pretty much any game that has a Middle Eastern
      theme.'
