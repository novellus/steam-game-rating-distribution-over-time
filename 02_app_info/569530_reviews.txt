It's very dead, VERY buggy, VERY laggy and server hosting is based on players and not the own developers. The devs clearly did not put any work on fixing bugs or just genuily making the game. I would not recommend buying it and, if it was on another team's hand, it would obviously be 20x better..","timestamp_created":1609631058,"timestamp_updated":1609631058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhZnf4vYCftLyvwI="}
