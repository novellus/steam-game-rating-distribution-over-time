      you to drive the Gp35 and DD35 as they appeared in 1963 when being demonstrated
      on various railroads but only Union Pacific and Southern Pacific took on the
      units.<br><br>The DD35 was a cabless booster (B unit) locomotive that consisted
      of two GP35 prime movers and electrical systems, mounted on a common frame and
      covered with a single cowling, riding on a pair of 4-axle Flexicoil trucks.
      As such, each prime mover powered a single set of four axles instead of two
      sets of two axles, as in the GP35.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Number

    review: I purchased the Up DD35 and the Demo DD35.  They both seem to have been
      installed in my game.  The UP DD35 works just fine and has nice and looks great.  However
      the Demo DD35 does not show up in my Sherman Hill section.  Does anyone know
      where it shows up?
