Extremely good tension build-ups. Some of the best I've experienced in a video game. \n2. Excellent atmosphere. \n3. Great detailed art. I won't describe my favorites because I don't want to spoil anything, but they are quite inspirational.\n4. Good OST. I'm a great fan of this style of minimalist horror. It's a very introspective style.\n5. Multiple endings for replay value.\n\nWhat Gurobu gets wrong: \n\n1. The story. The story is simple, though that isn't necessarily an issue. This may be a personal quibble but horror which utilizes the experience or memory of personal trauma is very overused (especially in modern horror). This archetype carries unnecessary self-important baggage. The worst form of this horror is when an entire story would be made irrelevant if the protagonist would happen to simply not exist. Gurobu does not utilize the worst form of this archetype, as there are significant issues unrelated to the protagonist which assist in the development of the protagonist and the story altogether. Still, trauma-based horror is a main theme of Gurobu. \n\n2. Typos. Not exactly a big deal in my personal opinion (especially considering they are rare), but it is a break from immersion when my eyes meet with a line like \"here's you cat!\" after the cat gets treated by the neighbor woman. Mistakes happen, but it's worth pointing out. \n\nOther than that, this game is a great little experience and easily worth the price. Great job Marx.","timestamp_created":1607631557,"timestamp_updated":1607631557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mNqTp/YCeavtuAI="}
