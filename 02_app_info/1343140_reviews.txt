A minor annoyance but one that happens with almost every choice that spawns more than a single line of text\n\nOverall:\nWould highly recommend it if you are after an intricate and curious story 8/10 so far","timestamp_created":1605071915,"timestamp_updated":1605071915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561768829822540283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/7jv2vUCeIHYrQI="}
