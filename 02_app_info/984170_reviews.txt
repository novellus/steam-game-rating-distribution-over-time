It plays exactly like a HOG in the sense that it’s first person, and your character goes from one location to another, gathers various items in the inventory that are used later in order to unlock puzzles and mini-games.\n\nBased on the exquisite presentation, at first sight [i]The Seven Chambers[/i] seems to be a high budget game. The visuals are impressive and I could easily call it “the most beautiful HOG I’ve ever played” (except it’s not a HOG, but you get the idea...) and in terms of cutscenes and character design, it surpassed all my expectations. Each location is more wonderful than the previous one, and all the characters are nicely drawn, especially the eye-candy Hamish, ([spoiler]your lover from a previous life[/spoiler]) who looks like he just stepped out of a fashion catalogue. Your adventure will lead you through a forest glade beside a lake, a fiery underground realm, a magical grove, a castle with gardens full of roses, an Egyptian-themed room and many others - each of them displayed in HD; this game breathes beauty through every pixel. But sadly that’s how far their budget went, since the other aspects of the game remained undeveloped and somewhat unfinished.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1993070813\n\nFirst of all, the story is a bit of a train wreck; it doesn’t naturally flow, it feels extremely fragmented. You play as Elasaid, a girl who fell into a coma and needs to traverse her sub-conscious, relive her past life as a Highland Warrior and follow an esoteric path to reach the “Seventh Chamber” which will somehow make her wake up from her coma. The historical setting of the 18th century makes it a game heavily influenced by astronomy and alchemy and while normally I greatly enjoy these topics, I disliked how they were used in the game. A plethora of concepts related to these themes are included in the story as object names, places, characters etc. but there is nothing to bind them together. What you get as a result is a mix of concepts: alchemical and astrological symbolism, constellations, planets, sacred artefacts or historical items blended with Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology. It feels that the game tries to accomplish something but it can’t decide what. Maybe my opinion is also biased by the fact that the diary (that usually describes in a few words the story up to that point and your objectives) has been completely abolished and replaced with a lore book (beautifully drawn if I must say) containing a brief explanation of some of the symbols, but nothing much to help you solve the puzzles whatsoever.\n\nSymbolism aside, the game also doesn’t manage to develop the characters well enough and their side stories are almost non-existent or left unsolved, unexplored. What’s the point of having such beautifully crafted characters if you’re not given a way to connect with them or get to know their background stories? Ultimately, at the end of the game, they feel like precious dolls in a shop’s showcase, untouchable.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1993070649\n\nIn terms of difficulty, there are a few puzzles that offer some challenge but most of them have an average difficulty and are often encountered in HOGs. The real difficulty comes from the fact that you don’t have a map (not even on “Novice”), no way to fast travel and no indications on the available actions, which will make you run back and forth through all the locations in order to find out what you have to do next. Things are made even worse by the fact that locations aren’t split into separate groups (per chapter for example, with items acquired and used only among those 4-5 locations) and you can end up having to go back from the end towards the beginning of the game. If that wasn’t enough of an annoyance, you get to hoard a huge lot of items in your inventory (2-3 pages is quite common for this game), which means that you will have a lot of unsolved puzzles that you have to keep track of in your mind. “Ok, I got this round object; for which of the 5 puzzles that require a round object is this one and where were they again?” is something you might end up saying quite often… Without using a hint / guide, the gameplay becomes extremely frustrating especially if you can’t play [i]The Seven Chambers[/i] in one sitting (I had to take a 20h break and when I came back to the game I had already forgotten where I had to use any of my 16+ items that I had collected by then.\n\nAchievement hunters will be disappointed to find out that despite in-game achievements existing, the Steam ones haven’t been implemented so far.

I encountered twice the same issue: most of the interface froze after finishing a puzzle; once I was lucky that the menu button still worked, but the second time the game didn’t respond at all, not even to an Alt-F4.\n\nPuzzles well explained? In general yes, but not all. Even if you’re a veteran HOG player, you will still find 2-3 puzzles that have unclear indications.\n\nPrice? A bit better compared to the the exorbitant way of Artifex Mundi pricing their latest games, but still quite high for the 3h of gameplay that you get from it. On the other hand, the art and the delightful soundtrack could be well worth spending a bit more money than what you would otherwise spend on an average HOG.\n\n[quote]More reviews on the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11354094]Lilly's Corner Curator page[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1581272760,"timestamp_updated":1581347508,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.818252384662628174","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8oHql/ACfNGc8QE="}
