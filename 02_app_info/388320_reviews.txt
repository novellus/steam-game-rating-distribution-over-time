You play as Reza, a young photographer who is taking pictures of the events that unfolds in the streets of Tehran where both sides of the revolution use violence, and where Reza is forced to take a side in the situation. Do he support the revolution, or do he resist it and disagree with the protests? That is very much up to you to decide for yourself as the game let you choose what to do, and how to act. You can refuse to give photographs and support the protest, or you can work with them. \n\nThere is also some brutal interrogation scenes with torture involved. These scenes can be very graphic at times. \n\nThe game also gives you a lot of context to what's going on. This is by no way a perfect game, most likely not the biggest budget either, but i feel that you get a good picture of what was going on, and that both sides used violence as a weapon. With the Shah using Evin Prison as a tool to torture and oppress the opposition it also becomes clear that the opposition (and now the regime) intensifies this and uses the same prison and continues torture and oppression of opposition. \n\nI feared when starting this game that it would be biast, but i feel i get a picture of both sides and that is something i must say i respect a lot.","timestamp_created":1609824146,"timestamp_updated":1609824158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514563083648681641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk+i/6PYCdvjNwAI="}
