      \  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]The search for DEEP loving[/b] is a visual novel about\
      \ a man in search of goodnight shaggin\u2019.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nRead five\
      \ messages a day and go on one-off \u201Cdates\u201D or skip the invitations.\
      \ [b]The search for DEEP loving[/b] is a bit like an interactive visual novel.\
      \ Each day, the main character receives up to five messages, each from a potential\
      \ partner or [i]killer.[/i] After speaking to a character enough times, they\
      \ will offer to go on a date. You may skip any number of dates ([i]often for\
      \ your own safety[/i]). Dialogue is predetermined, and the only player agency\
      \ is choosing whether or not to go on a date ([i]also[/i] with predetermined\
      \ dialogue). Many dates can lead to game-overs, but there is usually a means\
      \ to avoid getting arrested or killed. It goes without saying that you should\
      \ [b]save often.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe protagonist is on a hunt to find\
      \ a romantic partner via the dating app \u201CFOD\u201D. Unwilling to pay the\
      \ (exorbitant) monthly fee, he is determined to find a partner within the thirty-day\
      \ trial. To his dismay, the username \u201CI Want the D\u201D is already taken\
      \ \u2014 I was then prompted to name him. Lacking a \u201Cdefault\u201D name,\
      \ I typed [i]IWANTHED[/i] (pronounced \u201CI wan\u2019 the D\u201D or \u201C\
      I want heD\u201D. Either way gets the point across.)\n\nHuh, I guess he was\
      \ right \u2014 [i]I Want the D[/i] [b]is[/b] already taken!\n\nIWANTHED pokes\
      \ around the FOD and meets ogles of prospective men (or in one case, a woman\
      \ in need of a gay man). He meets a few wholesome individuals, but [i]mostly[/i]\
      \ druggies, molesters, murderers, and a wide variety of shady-sketchy men. Which\
      \ men IWANTHED ends up hangin\u2019 with (or getting [i]hanged by[/i]) is up\
      \ to you. Most, if not all of the available dates are optional, and don\u2019\
      t go past the first day.\n\nBut nobody likes to have a [i]dry bone,[/i] am I\
      \ right?\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen is a standard, below-average RPGMaker\
      \ screen. From \u201COptions\u201D, you may adjust audio and gameplay preferences.\
      \ The in-game visuals are RPGMaker defaults, and otherwise remarkable. While\
      \ I was impressed by the number of character portraits, I was [b]not[/b] impressed\
      \ by the sheer crudeness of the art. Now, I understand that the art style is\
      \ supposed to lend itself to the comedic tone of the game. However, it mostly\
      \ strikes me as [i]childish[/i] than funny. Regardless, I do appreciate the\
      \ variety of visuals, which contrast from the otherwise generic RPGMaker sprites.\n\
      \n[b]- The Goods-[/b]\nWhile there are sex scenes and [i]rapey[/i] situations,\
      \ sexual content is implied or glossed over. While the plot revolves around\
      \ a man in search of the D, I would not consider this to be an \u201Cadult-game\u201D\
      \ in the traditional sense. While I have my reservations (regarding the artist),\
      \ I would have still liked to have seen sexual content. Maybe I [b]wanted[/b]\
      \ to see two grown men eat gravy off of each other after stuffing themselves\
      \ stupid with tacos!\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI don\u2019t recommend this game,\
      \ but I think some people might get a kick out of it. [b]The search for DEEP\
      \ loving[/b] is an interesting concept, and I had a few laughs as I played this\
      \ game. Most of the humor fell flat for me, hardly nuanced and often shoved\
      \ in my face. It was so painfully obvious when a character was supposed to be\
      \ [i]creepy[/i] or [i]funny[/i] that there might as well been laugh tracks \u2014\
      \ as long as the writers think I\u2019m a dumb reader, they might as well let\
      \ me know when to laugh.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/the-search-for-deep-loving/]To\
