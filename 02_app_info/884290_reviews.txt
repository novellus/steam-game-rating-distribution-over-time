Wall jumping is inconsistent and seems to be completely random when it chooses to work. Also all the yarn is annoyingly 2 inches off the ground so instead of walking through it you have to jump around with stiff controls until you get it. I hope they make the controls more fluid and consistent in the future. I was going to speedrun this game to gather all the collectibles but the controls are just too hard to deal with.","timestamp_created":1531467714,"timestamp_updated":1531467714,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3dmlyeQCfcL3pQE="}
