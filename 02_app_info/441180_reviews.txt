Follow up to the 1K Corpses debut from Rob Zombie. I thought the acting was great in this and showed the descent of sanity of the towns lawman/sheriff in his pursuit to catch the Clan while they are on the run. He is the brother of the sheriff from the first movie also. Fighting fire with fire he slowly descends to their level of depravity. High level of gore, some nudity, language etc. Recommend 18+","timestamp_created":1525965858,"timestamp_updated":1525965858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51707613468170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzeSppeMCcqmKoAE="}
