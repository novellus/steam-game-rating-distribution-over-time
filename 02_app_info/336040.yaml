    review: "Ignore the negative press - the developers are not money hungry freemium\
      \ advertising junkies. This game is brilliant: the single player is enourmous\
      \ for a free-to-play, with increasing difficulty as you proceed in the campaign,\
      \ and refreshingly so (finally a game that genuinely challenges the strategist\
      \ in all of us!) Forget SIM City, forget Magic:the gathering, forget 3D Chess:\
      \ this game has ALL OF IT, with humour and a fascinating amount of strategies,\
      \ even more so with the latest v3:reinforcements release. This game is SO BIG\
      \ that it reminds of the good old days of \xA330 PC games with full content,\
      \ a great single player AND brilliantly fun multiplayer (once you get to grips\
      \ with single player of course!). It was a no-brainer to buy the tripler for\
      \ \xA32.99 after the first few rounds as quality and challenge shines through\
      \ and you know when a top game that only comes around once in a blue moon grabs\
      \ your attention. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the 'Legendary' or 'Rare' cards - having\
      \ played this game for more than a year, I can safely say it is all about a\
      \ good strategy, and with v3 there is even a mode called 'Pauper' where NO legendary\
      \ and rare cards are even allowed :D. With the plethora of monsters, equipment\
      \ and spells to pick from, there really is something for everyone and the variety\
      \ in strategies plus the new daily challenges AND the testing single player\
      \ campaign (that you can now play 4 times over with the different modes) is\
      \ simply BRILLIANT - this is THE BEST GAME (I've even sold my now dust-collecting\
      \ Xbox). THANK YOU RUBICON"
