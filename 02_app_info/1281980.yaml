    review: 'I have been watching a lot of AVGN and GDQ lately, so I was naturally
      attracted by the title "Catovania". I mean, Castlevania, but with cat! What
      could go wrong?


      There are some good things about this game, but the bad outweighs the good.
      In short, this game pretty much captures a lot of the strengths and weaknesses
      of the early SNES action games, and even plays like one. As I was playing it,
      I couldn''t help but imagine I am James Rolfe collecting material for an AVGN
      episode. I couldn''t even help writing this review AVGN style.


      Let''s start with the good.


      (1) The music, even though a bit monotonous, is great. Fits incredibly well
      with the game.


      (2) Enemies are TOUGH, and I appreciate the challenge. The kind that makes me
      feel like I achieved something every time I get past one. I have killed more
      than 50 bees over my course of play, and every time I kill one, it still feels
      fun.


      And then, the bad...


      (1) Unreasonable control scheme! Your left hand, at the minimum, has to deal
      with the run, the left/right and the jump at the same time. Whenever you do
      a running jump (which is all the time), you strain your left hand. The scheme
      even put the attack button on the left hand -- a fourth thing to handle (my
      first two tries were miserable, and my experience improved after I realized
      that I can attack with click). This raises several critical questions: (A) Who
      would think this control scheme is a good idea?? (B) Why can''t the cat be just
      running ALL the time?? Or why can''t the game at least give me a choice to toggle
      run?? (C) More broadly, why can''t I change the control scheme??


      (2) The boss fights make no sense. I have only made through the first two, but
      they don''t give me much motivation to continue. Boss movement has no pattern,
      making it impossible to learn; boss movement is very fast, making it impossible
      to react; and both the first two bosses have obvious blind spots on the screen,
      making it purely a test of patience (especially since it is absolutely necessary
      to conserve life).


      (3) The pitfalls and insta-deaths. I wouldn''t complain about it if the control
      scheme was better. It is just that the platforms, the spike pits and the bees
      that knock back combined are too much. I had to climb down the ladder, stand
      at the bottom of the screen (!!), and then jump-hit to kill the bees. (Again,
      a test of patience, because I had to wait for the bee to cycle back and forth.)
      Also, whenever there is a ladder that leads UP to the next screen, jumping up
      is risky; if you jump at the wrong angle, you might touch the spikes at the
      bottom of the next screen and die. I don''t like that at all!!


      Overall, I think this game has its fun element in it, albeit somewhat unpolished.
      I played for 2 hours and made it halfway to the third stage I think? It was
      fun overall, although I wouldn''t continue. I simply expected a game coming
      out in 2020 to be more thoughtful and not have so many drawbacks that the early
      SNES games have.'
