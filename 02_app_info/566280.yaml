    review: An outstanding soundtrack from what I believe to be a great shoot 'em
      up. When I first heard of Hurricane of Varstray, what made me want to buy it
      was the electrifying music from the trailer on its store page. As a fan of shoot
      'em ups I was plesantly suprised with a polished and enjoyable game, but what
      really set it apart from others was its music selection. Striking a similar
      tone to Grev's "Border Down," Hurricane of Varstray's soundtrack carries the
      themes of the game. From the cosmic and etheral main menu, to the upbeat character
      select, the intense level pieces, and the foreboding boss themes, every piece
      feels just right. I would recommend it a hundred times over to anime, sci-fi,
      and shoot 'em fans alike.
