    review: '[i]If two dragons dawdle in boredom, their adventure falls into the trash.[/i]


      I''m a big fan of the NES versions of Double Dragon. Back then, as I struggled
      against the final boss of Double Dragon 3, I was shaking, my blood pressure
      must be breaking records, and I was on the verge of cerebral hemorrhage. But
      I had no regrets, the game was excellent.


      Its pseudo-sequel, Double Dragon 4 did not surprise me, because before the purchase
      I had read a good part of the comments. But I wanted to give it a chance, curiosity
      and nostalgia had ganged up against reason.


      Rough handling. I cannot find the sensations of the NES versions.


      The platform phases ...


      No ground and pound. Technique that already existed in the first episode and
      could have been easily implemented.


      The Lee brothers are slow as turtles (but not mutant ninja). In Double Dragon
      3, Jimmy and Bimmy had however discovered one of the most secret and effective
      arcana of Sou-Setsu-Ken: running. Vital technique when your little sprite crosses
      long levels full of emptiness. In Double Dragon 4, they can no longer run.


      Although there is a Misfits fan in the new opponents, most lack charisma.


      The story and the dialogue have never been the strong point of the Double Dragon.
      On this point, the developers have managed to remain very loyal to the series.


      In a little over an hour I finished story mode and got a good start on the tower.
      I don''t feel like playing it again, the unlockable characters don''t motivate
      me and get bored but online doesn''t appeal to me.


      If I haven''t managed to dissuade you, and curiosity and nostalgia prevails
      with you too, never buy Double Dragon 4 full price. I wouldn''t give more than
      a kopek.


      To purify my ki after this outrage, I would instead switch to Double Dragon
      Advance or go back to Return of Double Dragon (Super Famicom).'
