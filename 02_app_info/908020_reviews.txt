There are certainly better games out there and this won't take long to complete or greatly challenge the player. Its mechanics aren't super interesting. \n\nHowever, this is the dev's first game and I want to be supportive of anyone coming out with a new idea on limited resources. I hope to see more from them and for them to expand better on their concepts.","timestamp_created":1575876851,"timestamp_updated":1575876851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4047l9O4CdqOS4wE="}
