      \ twist. Choose from three initial classes and unlock four more. Each class\
      \ has a unique set of abilities that correlates to falling blocks on the battle\
      \ board. The classes also have different stats altering the penalties they take\
      \ for filling their battle board or the speed that blocks fall onto the board.\
      \ As you move through procedurally generated maps, you add shapes into your\
      \ deck, gain potions, and add items that alter gameplay and can also stack for\
      \ impressive bonuses. Items can increase the size of your battle board, your\
      \ loot drops, your maximum health or much more. Beware though! As you add shapes\
      \ to your deck, the enemy\u2019s decks get bigger as well and their abilities\
      \ grow with each new map. At the end of each map battle a dragon boss with unique\
      \ abilities like reversing your controls or obscuring part of your battle board.\
      \ Play to become a master, or just have some casual fun, it is up to you!"
