I love going fast, smashing into things, and using bullet time to either correct my trajectory or to make for cool impact visuals as I travel at breakneck speeds. \nOnce you get a feel for how strong the launch kick is you start to not need the bullet time feature for normal jumps anymore, making you able to clear some levels with a target time of 1 minute in about 15 seconds in a glorious sequence of well angled jumps. You may find that after only a couple of hours of playtime you begin to perfect your movement, being able to move faster and with more power than before, and without making an accidental and fatal plunge off the edge. The feeling you get from it is true enjoyment and pride in your skill and results.\n\nWhile some levels are less fun and in my opinion work against the appeal of this game (looking at you, tombstone level), most levels are quite vast and allow you to quickly launch yourself across the vaporcore themed A E S T H E T I Cs. \n(Not to mention the killer soundtrack!)\n\nWhile the game lacks polish and proper level design in some cases, this game has great potential and I hope that the developers will consider making another installment in the future and trying to perfect the gameplay. \nBALLISTIC is a terribly ugly creature, and I love it to death. I think it could evolve into something truly extraordinary.","timestamp_created":1601926279,"timestamp_updated":1601926565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yPGQ/fQCfJuLpgI="}
