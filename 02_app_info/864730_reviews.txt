Lets see how it is after a couple of updates\"\n\n...Yeah, about that.\n\n5 months without updates. 5 months without a single thing. Game is still janky, still takes about 60 minutes to complete, still has untapped potential. But until the devs do something with that potential, my review stays negative. A shame.","timestamp_created":1605288847,"timestamp_updated":1605288847,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525846004486083984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1605521887,"developer_response":"Hi, Thanks for your review. We are sorry that we couldn't deliver the new update any sooner. Even with all the setbacks, we had to endure with corona, I can tell you that we are still working really hard on the new update. :3 It means a lot to us that you still see the same potential in the game as we see. \n\nThe new update is a complete overhaul of the core mechanics and took with a 2 man team, more time than expected. But we are coming close to the release of the new update, and there are many more to come! We are not abandoning this game, and we can't wait for you to come back once we have more content added to the game! :D\n\nIf you haven't already,  feel free to join our Panther VR discord. discord.gg/PantherVR\n\nStay safe!\n\n- Jesse"}],"cursor":"AoJ46fyq4fUCeoiUrgI="}
