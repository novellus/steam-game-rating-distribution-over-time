You play as Gebub, an orb-egg thing, who needs to explore the world and collect orbs and make friends with various animals. The whole game is hand drawn, there are a bunch of different areas, the platforming is quite light and friendly, and there are no enemies. This is the perfect palate cleanser after a long or tough game. The art is adorable, the music is lovely, the environments are fun, there are lots of different little things to discover (I loved the roach catapult, I loved the mole family portrait, I loved the little guy who rescues you when you fall off a ledge in purple zone). Just a dense, fun, little thing! \n\nHighly recommended, and at $2.99 on sale ($4.99 regular), you could even buy a couple copies for friends!","timestamp_created":1608691013,"timestamp_updated":1608691013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559640884399414063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42JrdxvYCcs+qvAI="}
