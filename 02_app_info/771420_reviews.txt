This is an extremely rare occasion nowadays when I can say: \"This game is my cup of tea!\" That was love at first sight, I'm telling you. And finally I bought it and played till the end.\nWords can't describe how charmed I am. No other game for quite some time could hook me that much. I couldn't stop till I beat it and it took me 3 hours, man. I haven't played anything that long in years!\nNow about the game. This is a work of art!!! Posh pixel art everywhere and very fluid, beautiful animation! Divine soundtrack with cool bass lines and some wind instruments, that help creating that ancient pagan atmosphere and more! Sounds are classic and very cool too. Very clever level design with as different areas with their own colour palletes and distinctive look as possible. \nIt's really really interesting, comfortable to play as controls are great, very responsive and you can feel your character's weight and moves. There are enough secrets to keep you checking everything around. And, what I like best in games - it's not very long. So you don't get sleepy on the way. You can play through from start to finish without getting tired, telling from my experience. And it's not short either. The bosses here are something! Regular enemies are fun to fight too.\nThe art is 16 bit and beyond. Not just Mega Drive or SNES - I don't think they could handle such things, but I'm not sure. To me it's more like an example of the best of 2D games on PlayStation. Many amazing details in the graphics... You have to see and hear that yourselves if you value good pixel art and superb video game music.\n\nGuys, developers, you are great! You made truly amazing, game, very dear to me. Thank you very very much! I wish there were more people like you, who can bring what made classic games so special into modern life. After completing it, having had such a blast, by so much enjoying this gem, I feel ashamed that I bought it on sale. I'll buy it for my friend too right now - a promise!\nThe only thing is... I think CRT filter doesn't work. Turning it on doesn't change anything and every time I quit and run game it says none instead of crt. Maybe there's something on my side. Please, fix it if it's not there, I'd love to see how it looks. I, and lots of other people, love good looking scanlines. And make more games like this one!!! I know it's far from being easy, but you're obviously good in this. Your game what you would call it touched my strings. And I'm so grateful for that! For all your time and work, your passion and patience!\nThe best of luck to you in your future, guys!","timestamp_created":1609704310,"timestamp_updated":1609867648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwNvl6fYCf+eWwAI="}
