It's odd that there really isn't another game quite like it.  It's similar to other endless space runners where you have to shoot things.  And there's like a thousand music rhythm games on Steam.  But this is the one of the few in VR where the music rhythm actually corresponds precisely to the game action (I'm talking about the in-game music, it probably woudn't correspond to your own music).  What separated this game from others in a crowded field and makes it unique, is that the the endless runner and music rhythm parts merged together seamlessly. I can't imagine playing this game separately from music and I can't imagine enjoying this music, without the gameplay.  \n\nI just loved the in-game disco themed music.  And the level became a lot easier, once I found the beat to the music.  It only took a few tries.  Soon, you're only looking at the visual cues for where to aim.  But when to fire is not done by visuals, but by audio clues and anticipation. And it's done flawlessly in this game.  \n\nThe cool thing is that you can miss quite a number of times before the music stops, at least on normal/easy difficulty.  \n\nRating 7/10 very cool game, must buy if you love music rhythm games, especially in VR ... I would rate higher if there were more different looking levels or more in-game music .. although I do appreciate you can listen to your own music while playing, I did find that the game doesn't do a good job of finding your music on the PC","timestamp_created":1511749787,"timestamp_updated":1511749847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/YDU/d8Ce5j8jwE="}
