Next thing I realized I was spending lots of time trying to figure out how to make the camera not zoom because it was making it too hard to figure what was around my ship.  Could not find manual zoom controls.  I also got upset because it seemed like I was getting stuck on stuff in the rooms that had objects in them.  Seemed like I was not close enough to the object to think i was gonna get stuck on it.  Picked up scrap into my ship cargo in the beginning and finished the mission.  Maybe i was not supposed to do that but the scrap stayed in my cargo and I could not find out how to empty it.  I do not like paying money to get frustrated.","timestamp_created":1584874162,"timestamp_updated":1584874162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470588237047195435","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ZD3gPECfIKD+gE="}
