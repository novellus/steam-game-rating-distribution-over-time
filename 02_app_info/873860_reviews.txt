It is many things, but mainly a way to create, test, and play your own video games. But the problems arise when things like unity and blender exist, that allow you to do the exact same thing, but this time there is a HUGE community of tutorials, support, and content, you can later transform your ideas into actual video games that can go on to be sold for money, and aren't filled to the brim with odd design choices and bugs. (They are also completely free!)\n\nOne more gripe that I have with this is that it uses the brand of Pop Island, that has had good successful games in the past. I wouldn't have much of an issue with this normally, if there hasn't been a proper Pop Island game since the year 2010 on the Nintendo DSi. I would LOVE to see a remastered version of Pop Island released today, and the branding of this... thing just gives sort of a false hope. \n\nIn short, the purpose of this game falls flat before it has a chance to prove itself, and digging into it, you will find bugs after poor grammar after bugs.","timestamp_created":1593142024,"timestamp_updated":1593142024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612756252288818359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9MKq9/ICfeadkAI="}
