Like all the other 8floor solitaire games it has a lot of bells and whistles. You can select from several styles of decks and even select the large style faces that make the cards easier to read.\n\nThere's a newbie route where things are easier. Music is OK, if a bit annoying after a while, but you can turn it off and play your own in the background. But like all the other titles from these devs, there are a few annoying aspects.\n\nThe game has a store where you use coins you earn in game to buy bonus cards like jokers, etc. OK, sounds like fun, right? Until you grind through a level to earn enough points to get enough jokers to play. You can shuffle if you have it or buy the option, but it usually makes hands worse, not better.\n\nWhy do levels matter? Because if you don't score enough points you can't unlock the next background. I'd love to see a casual route with all backgrounds unlocked and the ability to go back through the dealt cards, because that's how solitaire often works. And a layout choice.\n\nOverall it's a fun game with pretty cards in a tropical setting and I'm enjoying it. There does seem to be a bug where cards sometimes deal out two at a time, but other than that it's a fun casual game. \n","timestamp_created":1604602344,"timestamp_updated":1604602344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpJbwzPUCf87CrAI="}
