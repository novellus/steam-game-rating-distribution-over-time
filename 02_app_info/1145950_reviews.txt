It's small, but decent.\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nI really expected to like this game. I played the original game jam version and had a lot of fun with that. I'm a huge cheapskate so I was still on the fence about getting this version, but when I saw the new update with extra customization and configurable controls and the game on sale, I decided to go for it.\n\nSadly, I had more fun with the jam version...\n\nThe foremost problem for me is all the UI delays. I'm trying to play the game, but it's fighting me and wasting my time every step of the way. The UI animations are so long, it's a slog just navigating the menu. And you can't navigate around whenever/however you want, you're stuck in the rut it wants you to be in. If you hit the wrong button, you can't just hit escape a couple times and be back to the main menu. Once you select your ship, you can't pause, quit, or go back in any way...You have to wait through the \"Mission Objective\" screen, the game to load, the transition in, and press thrust to begin...and only THEN can you press escape to go back. It makes no sense.\n\n\"...optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms.\"\n[url=https://uxdesign.cc/the-ultimate-guide-to-proper-use-of-animation-in-ux-10bd98614fa9?gi=1e312a5f619d] - The ultimate guide to proper use of animation in UX [/url] \nIn Vector Prospector, switching menus takes 3+ seconds...\n\nThe in-game interlude whenever you collect a gem is definitely the worst. Sooo long. It's like the game stops and you have time to go to the bathroom. Sure, it's grandiose the first time, but the 2nd, 3rd, 4th...? No fun. I'm not sure why it even pauses there. And it's not skippable. None of the fluff in the game is skippable, from the opening logos to the end game report. Unlock a new powerup? You'd better get the popcorn.\n\nRemember browsing the internet on dial-up? It's like that.\n\nIt's a quick roguelike, right? It should take about 1.5 seconds to get playing again after I die.\nBack to Nuclear Throne I guess.\n\nSome other minor gripes:\n\n- I'm not sure why the enemy turrets' detection range is so darn long. It's not much fun to have enemies snipe at you from two screens away.\n\n- The controls are basic. A tiny bit of acceleration when you start turning would have made it much, much easier to aim precisely, but not slow down longer turns.\n\n- Your thrust gets boosted if you're close to a wall...I can see how this could save you if you were going too fast, but more often it means you get a sudden, massive boost to your thrust when you are in a tight space...\n\n- Having configurable controls is VERY welcome, but it has some minor issues. 1)The menu is controlled with the gameplay controls, so it's easy to mess that up (like if you want \"up\" to be \"thrust\"). In my opinion, arrow keys, enter, and escape should -always- work (predictably) in the menus. 2)It doesn't tell you when you're trying to use a key that's already bound, it just doesn't respond. 3)It doesn't display a bunch of the punctuation keys (it shows nothing), though they work just fine. Maybe something weird with the font?\n\n- Sometimes the background gets pretty much pure black, so can be hard to tell at a glance what's solid ground and what's open space.\n\n- I wish there was an indicator for how many shots you have available. You have 3 ammo that regenerates, but no way to see how many you have left at the moment.\n\n- I noticed one small visual glitch: Sometimes the side edges of ground tiles don't get drawn, I think when the falling blocks slide down away from them.\n\n- Only one other bug I noticed: Sometimes your ship will run into blocks that aren't there(!). I think it has something to do with the falling blocks. Bullets and other falling blocks pass through the tile, but your ship and laser sight are blocked by it. A bit frustrating when you collide with thin air and lose a bunch of health.\n[Edit:] Yup, definitely with the falling blocks. Only the small ones it seems. Sometimes after they fall there's an invisible tile that your ship, your laser sight, and the energy pickups collide with.\n\n- I wish there was some noticeable variation between runs. Even just varying the size and shape of the map could shake things up (long & narrow? short & wide?), or a different number of gems (shorter playthroughs might be nice), or wildly different obstacle spawn rates. The same content, but more replayability. Or, you know, more ships that behave differently would be cool too. :)\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nOtherwise, the game does seem well made. Nothing amazing, but pretty decent. I am just picky :) Other than the occasional foreground/background confusion, the graphics are quite clear and nice. I quite like the sounds. It's a relatively small download size, and it runs okay on my old computer.\n\nThere's not a lot of content, but it's reasonable. You find the powerups occasionally during the mission and they last for a matter of seconds. There's the basic ship and two others with special abilities. The slow-mo ability is quite fun.\n\nPlaythroughs are a bit longer than I expected. There's an achievement for winning in less than 17.5 minutes, so that could be considered fast. I haven't -quite- gotten that, and one run I putzed around digging for a while and took about 45 minutes. :}\n\n(Note: I played more hours offline and unlocked everything.)","timestamp_created":1609538062,"timestamp_updated":1609552645,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uIm04PYCd7/DvwI="}
