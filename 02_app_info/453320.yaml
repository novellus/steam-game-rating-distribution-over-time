    review: "old school late 80s JRPG like adventure game. The team with just 2 persons\
      \ spent 3 years making the game.\nat least 20 hours or even longer gameplay\
      \ for casual playing.\n\nThe game is for you, if you want feel that kind of\
      \ old school adventure game.\n\ncontent is really rich, npc conversations, main\
      \ quests, side quests that reward you with travel improvement, and the creative\
      \ puzzles you need to solve to advance\nBGMs are so great.\nThe gameplay and\
      \ story will surprise you, the team added new ideas into it. \n\nYou won't be\
      \ walking around, spamming your sword to kill the boss everytime.\n\nmaps &\
      \ scenes are beautifully designed, please enjoy while exploring\n\nYou got great\
      \ content waiting for you when you progress, and please explore every corner\
      \ of the world, find the secret quests and rewards.\n\nThe team did put a lot\
      \ of enthusiasm making the game.\n\ncharacter cannot move diagonally, neither\
      \ the monsters. \n\nGamers not used to this way of playing may feel a bit difficult\
      \ at the beginning, just spend some time to adapt it, it's not that difficult.\n\
      Besides, there are easy, normal and hard mode for gamers to start.\nDuring your\
      \ adventure, the game gives you enough herbs and items to advance and defeat\
      \ the bosses.\n\nPlease don't quit the game too early when you had difficulties,\
      \ go to the forum and ask for help, developer is kind and helpful.\nDon't need\
      \ to play this game in a rush, please try to finish the game, or you'll miss\
      \ the great content behind.\n\nIt's sad that the game did not get a big sale,\
      \ it deserves one."
