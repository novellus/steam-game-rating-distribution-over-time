The story continues, but the characters are all vastly different from even the 2nd game, despite having the same names. But that in itself doesn't make a game bad: this one has a cheesy, infuriatingly bad story, and point-and-click puzzles that make almost no sense at all. The hidden-object scenes and puzzle mini-games are entirely generic. They are adequate, I'll give them that.\n\nBottom line: just below mediocre.","timestamp_created":1594700810,"timestamp_updated":1594700810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8ejkpfMCfJ+UlQI="}
