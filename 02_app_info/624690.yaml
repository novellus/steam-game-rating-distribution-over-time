    review: '[b][i]NEXT JUMP: Shmup Tactics[/i][/b] is a turn-based tactics game based
      on the action-packed shoot-em-up genre. The end result is a curious roguelike
      unlike any other.


      Battles are a scant three turns long, but by collecting energy from destroyed
      enemies you can do more moves during your turn. With each move you can travel
      directly to any tile within range, and a thick line shows if you''ll collide
      with any hazards. As you destroy enemies and collect their scrap (currency),
      your reputation (score) improves. This lowers prices in the shop, but also makes
      stronger enemies appear in battle.


      There are several ships to try, each with it''s own method of attacking enemies.
      Different environments also add wrinkles to the gameplay. Solor winds push all
      ships after each turn. Storms randomly lower ships'' energy. Nebulas are shrouded
      in darkness. And meteors can be used as cover.


      Unfortunately, the visuals can get very cluttered. Multiple ships/projectiles
      can occupy one tile, and some land between tiles. They all move simultaneously,
      and all actions happen in about half a second. Some bullets look similar to
      energy, and it''s difficult to tell which direction some bullets face. The interactable
      scrap/meteors don''t contrast with those in the background. Put all this together,
      and half the challenge is just reading the current gamestate.


      To make things worse, the game explicitly refuses to tell you about its many
      enemy types. Combined with the visual clutter, learning enemies is a painful
      process of trial-and-error. And yet, once the learning is complete, NEXT JUMP
      manages to provide a moderately fun tactics game with interesting systems, at
      a very low price point.


      Taking everything into account, I rate this game [b]7/10[/b]. If the visuals
      were cleaner and the level design was less procedural, this could''ve very well
      been a 9/10.'
