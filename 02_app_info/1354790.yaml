    review: "Well, this DLC is the Hardcore-Version of this game. It's really hard\
      \ to not use \"Joe\" the ingame helper for all of these pictures and if you\
      \ don't have much time less than don't buy this DLC. \n\nPro:\n- if you a fan\
      \ of this art and have a huge lifetime, than you can buy it\n- you got a good\
      \ mouse and finger skills...it's yours \n\nCons:\n- if you wanna 100 % you need\
      \ this DLC\n- high price, maybe if there is a sale you can buy it\n- \"Joe\"\
      \ the ingame helper will be your new friend \n\nI like this games and i hope\
      \ there coming more parts of the game, but this DLC is the horror part. But\
      \ please no more of this DLCs \n"
