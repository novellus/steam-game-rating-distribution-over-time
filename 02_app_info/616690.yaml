    review: 'For a couple bucks, this game is worth it.  However my biggest gripe
      is it''s lack of physics that even exist in the most rudimentary of Breakout
      clones from 30+ years ago.  The ball drops, and where it hits on your paddle
      has no effect on where it will travel.  It''s very random and sometimes VERY
      frustrating, especially when you are down to your last few pixels.  Momentum
      of the paddle also has no effect.

      You''ll have a few blocks to go on left field, but no matter how you hit the
      ball or how hard, it travels to the right.  Since your paddle only has limited
      hits, you know you''ll get a game over.


      I play the game with the mouse, and although you see the cursor you can''t click
      on any menu items and are forced to use the keyboard.


      I love the crazy "plot" screens that appear, but having to restart to the main
      menu EVERY TIME YOU GET A NEW ONE gets old very fast.  I want to keep coming
      back, but as the game gets harder you realize more and more how flawed it is.  I''m
      enjoying the story, and a few parts even had my jaw wide open, but having to
      grind through the stages becomes a chore.


      I really wish the main gameplay was fixed, then this game would easily be worth
      a purchase.  Otherwise you''ll likely be like me and only play a few minutes
      of time before getting frustrated and shut it off.  Time to go play Arkanoid
      instead.'
