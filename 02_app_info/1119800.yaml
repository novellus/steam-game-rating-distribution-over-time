    review: 'Make this a full-fledged RPG!!! DO IT! PLEASE!  This game could be major,
      but as it stands it can be beat in an hour.  It''s fun to replay though.  Not
      worth the full price, and even the sale price is a bit high.  Seems like you
      get more content with Featherfall.  That being said, it is super fun and feels
      great to play, and is that perfect kind of game I always wanted.  Sokpop should
      make a kickstarter for a huge RPG game, like Souls, or Zelda, etc.


      PRO:  Fun, pretty

      CON: Short, over-priced'
