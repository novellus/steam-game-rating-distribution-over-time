      inspired by the gorgeous pixel art of PC-98 games and a melodramatic story full
      of betrayal and crescendo. Follow Vassan, Eugenie and Memnon as they flee their
      home in search for a better tomorrow in this stylish visual novel!<br><br><strong>--STORY--</strong><br><br><i>The
      royal city of Flayes has been under siege for months. The food is running out
      everywhere but the royal court. High society lives like there's no tomorrow,
      and for a reason. One night the walls protecting the city break down and Vassan,
      Eugenie and Memnon are forced to accept reality, their homeland is no more.
      High society has raised these people extremely selfish, but as they flee Flayes
      they are forced to change their ways. But is it possible to value kindness and
      life in a world where individual lives have little value?</i><br><br><strong>--CHARACTERS--</strong><br><br><img

    review: A dark kinetic novel about war and guilt in a fantasy world reminiscent
      of the French Revolution, with art reminding of VNs from the early 90's. Short
      but worth reading.
