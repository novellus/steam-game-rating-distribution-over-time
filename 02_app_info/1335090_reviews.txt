I've always enjoyed it and the chance to have it in the best quality possible AND support the the series? Cool!\n\nWhy I don't recommend it, is it's literally missing a song. The boss theme. One of the best songs in the game to me.\nOh sure, it HAS the song in the soundtrack, but it's the \"SE version\" meaning, for some reason, they have battle sounds, voices played over it. \n\nI contacted capcom and asked if this was a mistake, or if they could help out. Their reply? They can't help because \"It isn't a game\"\n\nIs it petty to not recommend an OST because of 1 song missing? Maybe. But I love the heck out of the song and I'm not happy it's missing. If you can deal with that one song being MiA, then go for it! I hope they bring the game to steam too, along with the other BoF titles. \nBut I'm applying for a refund. \n\nBreath of Fire 4's OST has every song as far as I'm aware of, listened to all of them & all battle themes & boss themes. They even have the opening song without Ryu & Nina talking over it. So that gets a double thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1599017385,"timestamp_updated":1599017385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.704106688499450684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wp+3pvQCd4OjnwI="}
