The artstyle is really nice, too. The only real issue I have with it is the fact that the ending is... Really lacking. I think that's universally agreed upon. No spoilers, but everything sort of comes to a head before... Ending. There isn't even any dialogue exchanged in some of the final, most climactic moments of the game! It was pretty disappointing to say the least. \n\nThat aside, though, it's not enough to make me down-vote it. I wish there was a neutral option when it comes to recommending games, because that's what I would use, here. It's a decent point-and-click that just happens to be unfortunately curt with it's ending.","timestamp_created":1609882196,"timestamp_updated":1609882196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgpud6vYCe8vpwAI="}
