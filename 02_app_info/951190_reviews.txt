Three different heroes, sixteen enemies - each single one with interesting and unique skills. The game itself is really challenging.\n\nOne question - did anyone crack the third nest level (with Living Weapon)?","timestamp_created":1587563260,"timestamp_updated":1587763411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607077896595001221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g9+E1/ECfavaggI="}
