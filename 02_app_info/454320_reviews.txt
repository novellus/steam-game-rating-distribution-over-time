It has a programming theme, similar to SpaceChem.\n\nBut the forced tutorials! Where you can do nothing but click where the game tells you to click! Hate that! They ruin the discoverability; you feel the game treats you like you are unable to explore, to try, to learn, to experiment (bad game design in my opinion). Between that, and the lack of achievements I don't feel like playing this game anymore.\n","timestamp_created":1609076459,"timestamp_updated":1609076459,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ438ib0vYCc7PgvQI="}
