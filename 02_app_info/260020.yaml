    review: 'Who knew that Jerry West could not be a member of ABBA if the members
      of the group were members of the ABA because West was never an ABA player?


      That''s just one of the thousands of questions in You Don''t Know Jack Sports,
      a sports variant of the show where high culture and pop culture collide!


      Get ready for the nostalgia of this game!'
