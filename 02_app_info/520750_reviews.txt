This game is not like Doom.  It's not Dark Souls.  It's just another wave shooter with decent sized environments that allow you to teleport or almost full trackpad locomotion with snap turning.  It's on sale now for $8.99, is there enough here to recommend at the sale price?  Short answer, no.  \n\n[B][U] PROS [/U][/B]\n\n+ nice, large, detailed environments\n+ easy, normal, hard don't just add more enemies, they add different ones\n+ weapons do different things: melee, ranged, AOE\n+ enemies do different things: melee, ranged, AOE\n+ mini-bosses and bosses\n\n[B][U] CONS [/U][/B]\n\n- bugs, after dying I coudn't select any weapon and had to die\n- no story\n- i had trouble with hit detection on sword, many times I swung and nothing happened\n- so you're supposed to be this action-hero, but usually you'll just be hiding behind cover and just finding that one spot in the map that makes it easy to snipe enemies \n- dumb AI for the most part, why do ranged enemies run towards you instead of looking for cover and trying to snipe you?\n- drones in medium difficulty in this fantasy setting?  WTF?\n- melee can kill anything just by swinging at them, shields of enemies do nothing, no parrying, no strategy .. when it works with the mysterious hitboxes of enemies\n\nI just think the negatives outweight the positives.  I wanted to like this game.  I was looking forward to a wave shooter where you can move around.  But there's just really no strategy other than find the best sniping spot.  Even the boss fights were not thrilling because of the clunkiness of combat.\n\nRating 4.5/10 can't recommend at sale price of $8.99, currently it's more of a $5 game if that, feels EA, not 1.0","timestamp_created":1514788421,"timestamp_updated":1520309828,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556400477886199951","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmt/h/OECef++lAE="}
