Make sure to delete intro.slf in the game folder or else you'll get a black screen and game will freeze. Also note you won't be able to alt-tab out of the game without it crashing. Unfinished business doesn't run if you launch the .exe however if you download a NOCD patch which you can find online the game will run fine. Great game highly recommend it even for its age.","timestamp_created":1608343714,"timestamp_updated":1608343714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwja+wvPYCdO6puwI="}
