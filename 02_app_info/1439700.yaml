    review: "Wow, just like I expected I just really love RhinoGearz Visual Novels.\
      \ The writing, story telling and just in general how he likes to form romance\
      \ stories and relationships just really fits with my own personal likings. You\
      \ play a young guy entering a magic academy and finding the love of your life\
      \ in it. The relationship development is really nice and I also really enjoyed\
      \ the overall story apart from the romance itself. Considering that you also\
      \ get around 4 hours of story and that it is only 2 euro, I will never understand\
      \ why his games dont take off more. For this price you wont find anything better\
      \ on steam when it comes to romance VNs and just overall positive story telling.\
      \ \n\nIf you are looking for a positive and very relaxing read then highly recommended.\
      \ There is no r18 content though so if you are looking for that you might want\
      \ to look elsewhere. If you care about story though and not just visuals then\
      \ its really great. Apart from that the art itself is also pretty good and really\
      \ if you consider the price you cant expect anything more from this VN.\n\n\
      9/10\n\nCheck out my Curator Page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34401214/"
