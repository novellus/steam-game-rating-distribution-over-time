The frigging elephant in the room though is the unbelievably bad english translation.\nAt times I thought maybe the game really was about guessing what they were trying to say.\n\nNow you could fix the english translation, add some running and fix the shooting, but then, this would be over in 10 minutes, because the game's \"story\" is really short.\nI don't get why somebody would put this up for sale here, this should be a free game at best.\n\"Please you make game better at time next!\"\n\nPlay at your own risk and don't say I didn't warn you!","timestamp_created":1588629311,"timestamp_updated":1588629311,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44fHr8PECcczNhQI="}
