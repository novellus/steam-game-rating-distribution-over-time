But the story is nonexistent anyway.\n\nOh apparently this is but just one of the game mode, the other mode is the regular Bullet Soul. What makes Infinite Burst different? The game has no power ups, you start (and stay on) maximum power, and the standard \"bomb\" mechanic has been turned into \"burst\" which fills regularly, clears the screen as it used in a flash, and upgrade your firepower (but not making you invulnerable). Also unlike other many 2D shooters, your ship didn't blow up and replaced by the other and drain your power ups or making it drop, instead there are shield, you got hit you stop firing and invulnerable for awhile. Shield is replenished regularly as you pick the \"A\" (or \"R\"?) green boxes that sporadically dropped once per level.\n\nDifficulty raises on its own from stage to stage, from \"so easy you can avoid getting shot\" to \"basically luck and pray you didn't get shot\" as you often graze the very very very small gap between all those bullets, your color of bullets isn't different against the enemies, and lastly, again, the small game window screen.\n\nOverall if you get this for free or as a bundle, play it. Otherwise, uhhhh.... idk, 2D shooters are basically relic of a (perceivedly) better days at the arcade community or the \"shmups\" forums (never liked the term shoot em up or run and gun, because it can mean anything from 2D shooters to 3D first or third person shooters, it's 2D shooters for me, always)\n\nMight consider getting a DLSS card just to upscale this.","timestamp_created":1608839479,"timestamp_updated":1608839479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ceTy/YCf5vuvAI="}
