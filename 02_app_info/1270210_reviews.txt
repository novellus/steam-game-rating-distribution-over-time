This game did just that, so here I am...    and it's a somewhat long one with personal opinions, so try to bear with me or at least be warned. :)\n\nAt first glance this game may seem like just another story driven visual novel with erotic contents, so not really sure why I took another look. Reading the other reviews got me really interested though, since I used to be a frequent reader of alternative literature and most of the comments gave a positive story reaction. It was on sale and I thought, \"why the hell not, I have the time atm!\" and got it. Didn't start the game for a week or so, but when I did it had me hooked! Good thing indeed that I had time off work...\n\nLike many of these type of games, the decisions allowed by the main character aren't always what you want to do or say, but for me they kind of resonated with the story well enough to keep me interested and go along with the turn of events. The character building and spell management as well as the combat system isn't really the best, but it does what it's meant to do. The only times I really got frustrated or considered taking a break from the game was when you are left to your own devices, since the mission system and feedback for development of the character are somewhat lacking. The erotic events are well made when they occur, although for me they are perhaps not what makes the game most enticing. \n\nThe following part may contain some slight spoilers, so again, be warned...    as I talk about what really had me going all day and night with this game. \n\nThe story being of an Arthurian legend type aside, the references to well known (for me) entities of history, myth or fiction that tickled the mind, having you guessing and giving the satisfactory feeling of 'I knew it!'-moments is a really nice and not an obstructive part of the storytelling. The characters have their own sense and, if perhaps a bit stereotypical at times, they really got me invested. Some twisting mind games of hidden allegiances, turning the story and path of the character on end, keeping me wondering what's what and who's really involved. The bodies of text are of fair length, the conversations had me at least following along and interested, though as some times could've been better timed. \n\nWhat really struck me at many points where how excited I actually got at pivital moments in the story. Even though the music and visuals do help with the effect, it was the weight of the relationship the main character had developed with the group and connected individuals. It may be my current emotional state or times we live in that makes me more susceptible to such emotional bounding, but judging from the other players reactions I think there is something special here. And I'm not talking about the erotic encounters, although of course they had their part in building the emotional bonds, but it was the times that the characters were at risk or had important decisions to make or were unaccounted for that had my heart pounding. \n\nAll in all, I'd say that the game is really worth playing at least ones for the content available and story alone. It has some serious flaws in the user experience department which would have made the game so much more enjoyable, but with some patience and the will to experiment it's good enough. I will eagerly await for the next part of this trilogy and really hope the magic is still there! I would not at all mind a modified release of this first game or perhaps dlc with other things to do along the way up to the moment that...  well, do find out yourself what I almost revealed. ;)","timestamp_created":1610044830,"timestamp_updated":1610044830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk86J7/YCd9irwQI="}
