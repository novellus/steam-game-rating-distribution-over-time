    review: "To be honest, the later games in the Hegemony series dont hold a candle\
      \ to this classic. Hegemony Gold should have been genre defining and sadly is\
      \ more of a hidden gem. If you can look past the old graphics and the somewhat\
      \ harsh difficulty (i play on normal and the game is a sometimes tough challenge\
      \ but never a grind) then you are in for a treat. The games mechanics are simple\
      \ yet complex , and original, and the game rewards strategic thinking and long\
      \ term planning. The importance of blockades, raids on farms and disrupting\
      \ your enemies supply chain is a core part of the game and not something replicated\
      \ in other grand strat games like EU, Crusader Kings, Imperator Rome or the\
      \ Total War series. The world feels alive and vibrant and everything has at\
      \ least some information which you can quickly access by pressing F1. Combat\
      \ is easy to manage with a pause function and all orders are hotkeyed to the\
      \ num pad on any standard keyboard. The Phillip of Macedon campaign is fantastic\
      \ and i cant attest to the two Greek campaigns as I havent played them.\nSandbox\
      \ mode is also a lot of fun, however you must keep in mind the game wil not\
      \ set you missions in the same manner as in the Phillip campaign. You follow\
      \ your own path completely and at your own pace, there is no rush, no \"30 turns\
      \ to capture X province\" or else a doomstack will spawn up your arse. The game\
      \ is not flawless, but its close. \n\nhegemony Gold is simply one of the best\
      \ games in the genre."
