      notes: "It's cartoony violence and gore. The animal cast of characters deal\
        \ with drug references and guns. They shoot each other and explode into bloody\
        \ cartoony gibs.\r\n\r\nIf you take off your character customization clothing\
        \ options, a mosaic filter appears over the characters, although there's nothing\
        \ really shown under there. "
