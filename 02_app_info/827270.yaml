    review: 'Cute little time-waster. For $1.50 (sale) you can''t go too wrong.


      It''s basically Where''s Waldo but with moving parts and a different target
      each time. It is the same thing over and over again with more of everything
      as the levels get harder. The backgrounds also switch from dark to light which
      can really mess with you depending on the ships you''re assigned to look for.
      Even on Easy mode, I was alternating between finding my target instantly to
      staring at the screen for the entire time limit and never once seeing any of
      the ships I was looking for thanks to the background being a color that camouflaged
      the ONE little thing that would have made my targets stand out on a different
      background.


      Hard mode really amps up the number of ships (from 400 to 800) scrolling across
      the screen and gives you more targets to keep an eye out for. Everything moves
      faster, too.


      You get a score based on how much time you have left after shooting your last
      target but that score doesn''t seem to do anything or unlock any fun new goodies.
      There are also VIP ships that show up randomly, but only in hard mode. The game
      could probably benefit from some power-ups or unlockables.


      As for the other aspects of the game:


      Music/sounds: Only able to turn off or on, no sliders.  Music is actually not
      too bad, even if it''s the same tune forever and ever.

      Resolution: I can''t find any options in-game for resolution other than the
      + button in main menu that either makes it fullscreen or some preset windowed
      resolution that you don''t get to choose.

      Achievements: There are NOW achievements pertaining to shooting the VIP ships
      but there aren''t any based on scores, so I have no idea what good scores are.


      To wrap it up: as I opened with, it''s a nice time-waster for the price. Simple,
      it works, and it''s chill. Probably a good one for winding down before bed but
      once you''ve got all the achievements, there probably isn''t much reason to
      keep going.'
