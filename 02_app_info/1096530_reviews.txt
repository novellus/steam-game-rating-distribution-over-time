In battles it isn't clear to me who has been hit and even how the dice system really works, but to say the odds are stacked against you and it all comes down to being at the mercy of the dice. I'm wondering if I'll ever get through my next battle. I've tried over a dozen times and it is really frustrating because I want to see more without practically starting over.","timestamp_created":1610061796,"timestamp_updated":1610061796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqqrK7/YCc9OzwQI="}
