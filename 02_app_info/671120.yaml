    about_the_game: "Riot in space... The committee of intergalactic travel decided\
      \ to build a new star route, Star Route 66. At first the kingdom of Flee was\
      \ happy to get connected to the gigantic network connecting the whole galaxy.\
      \ The small empire would grow strong again and nobody can refuse the wealth\
      \ that usually comes with a star route connection. After completion and a few\
      \ accidents it turned out that flying one of the smaller Flee space discs on\
      \ an intergalactic travel route is a dangerous game. Because of their small\
      \ size the discs cannot be detected by the sensors of most star route travellers.\
      \ The Flee uprising started when a member of the Fleeish royal house crashed\
      \ into a spaceship truck. Since then Flees have tried to block the route. Encouraged\
      \ by the royal house some of the space pirates joined in to fight the brave\
      \ spaceship truckers just trying to make a delivery on time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nSpaceship Trucker is a 2D shooter. You are a spaceship trucker travelling\
      \ down the dangerous star route. The Flees will try to block your way through\
      \ space and pirates want to steal your precious cargo. Watch out for meteors\
      \ as well. In each level you'll have to prove yourself worthy of being a spaceship\
      \ trucker by fighting off dangerous boss enemies.<br />\r\nGood luck to you,\
