As soon as I got the email that the game is released I brought it. (lol) I love the simplicity of the game play, the vibes, the hours I put to crack a puzzle. I mean my friend doesn't even play games but she loved this one. This is enjoyable and would recommend anyone to play.","timestamp_created":1606415012,"timestamp_updated":1606415012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwivrygvYCcfrcsgI="}
