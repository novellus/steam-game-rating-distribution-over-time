    review: "Would toss it in a mixed option if possible. It's not great, but I don't\
      \ think it's the worst thing ever either. The art is mostly pretty bad ms paint\
      \ level. Largely the CGs that appear during the game itself, while the ending\
      \ CGs are better quality. And the character sprites are fine, although all the\
      \ female characters share the same body.\n\nThe 'story' is more about the characters\
      \ than the overall plot, and it's a bit rushed to get to where you're going.\
      \ I thought the endings were pretty cute for each character, I'm gay so only\
      \ really bought it for the one m/m romance. But figured I'd try the rest out.\n\
      \nThe writing is not great, everybody talks similarly. Meaning the writer didn't\
      \ really approach each character with a unique voice. Tossing a few \"sweeties\"\
      \ or \"hun\" [or whatever cute thing Mai said] doesn't make a unique character.\
      \ And at times there's some repetitious dialog, particularly when doing the\
      \ \"fun vs serious\" super hero discussion and choosing the fun option. And\
      \ there are some grammar problems here and there. \n\nThe CG menu is oddly organized,\
      \ the CGs aren't grouped by character they're just randomly tossed in there\
      \ it's weird. \n\nThe 'suspicious man' subplot is weird and the ending of it\
      \ is bizarre and kind of funny in how stupid it is. That ending is the same\
      \ regardless of your choices, every choice is entirely about your relationship\
      \ ending and nothing else changes. Including forgetting that you went on this\
      \ trip with a friend and if you choose any other character the story forgets\
      \ that and doesn't address what happens to her when you end up shacking up with\
      \ one of the other three. I guess she's in Europe alone. lol\n\nBut for $1 it\
      \ was fine, I enjoyed my time with it. If you're looking for a good game, there\
      \ are certainly better uses of your time before you try this one out. But as\
      \ a risky buy, I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't complete trash like everyone\
      \ was saying. \n\nAnd I personally experienced very minimal bugs, the only real\
      \ one is the skip would get stuck at times and sometimes clicking an option\
      \ wouldn't be responsive right away and I'd have to click again. But getting\
      \ through all endings was easy and painless for me."
