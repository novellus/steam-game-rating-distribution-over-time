I played this game originally back in the 80's, so for me it's rather retro-style game play - brings back lots of memories. To me, the entire Infocom series is underrated as they are truly some terrific games to play. It is my hope and wish that eventually all the Infocom games will be published on Steam.","timestamp_created":1609534315,"timestamp_updated":1609534315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n5Pu3/YCebDBvwI="}
