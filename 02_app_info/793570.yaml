        The Darkness''s 2003 power ballad &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;.

      \ main reasons you do not recommend the game are:\n\n[*]It does not have CPU\
      \ players\n[*]It does not have online multiplayer\n\nI have tried to make this\
      \ as clear as possible on the store page. Unfortunately I have not translated\
      \ the page into your language. I am sorry for that. However, please note that\

      \ to hear that you are unhappy with the lack of online multiplayer and CPU opponents.\
      \ Please note online multiplayer is currently in development. \n\nOne final\
      \ note CPU opponents is not something I am focusing on. I currently believe\
      \ they are more trouble than they are worth. However if there is enough community\
      \ interest in them I will add them.\n\nI would like to thank you for the feedback\
