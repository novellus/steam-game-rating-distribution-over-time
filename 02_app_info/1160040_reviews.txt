I play a ton of simulation games, and I sincerely hope this one doesn't get abandoned (the dev's fast response on the discussion board suggests otherwise). \n\nPros:\nEasy to understand process with fairly optimized factory production. I wasn't able to find anything that was too over or underpowered: the numbers felt just right. \n\nSolid music, a must have if a simulation game is to keep you hooked\n\nAttempt at humor is hit or miss, but I find the whole idea of the game hilarious. Some funny dialogues too. I hope the dialogues get expanded as they become repetitive after a few hours. \n\nGreat progression sequence. I felt like each step was difficult and rewarding, causing me to rethink my strategies in order to optimize production.\n\nThe research tree is well optimized. I felt like I was struggling to get to the next research and when I finally did, it completely changed how I was able to play. I constantly found myself reimaging my factory and thinking of how the information i just got will affect my next steps. This is the core of a good simulation game and the reason that I was able to look over a definitely-concerning amount of bugs.\n\nThe breeding sequence looks really cool, although I wasn't able to get that far. I like how the game pushes you to stratify between your humans to find the highest quality ones and use them for different purpose to your low quality ones, which you basically immideately harvest after they run on the treadmill for a little white. I think it will be awesome once you can raise kids from children!!\n\nThe path forward for the game is clear and well established. There are a ton of options for the dev and the community through modding to expand the game and offer new features. So long as the numbers match up (and that seems fairly easy to do), there could be an insane ammount of content. And the building system, once fixed, will make building to scale fairly easy such that you can incorporate all sorts of new features. \n\n\nHere are a few of the nearly game-breaking glitches that made me want to quit (although, again, the pros made me stay). \n\nCons: Bugs, bugs, bugs. \n\nBuilding can be a little annoying for a few reasons. A) The delete key sometimes sticks (although this problem went away after I started holding down the delete key and playing for an hour or so). B) Directions of the belts can get a little wonky. 3) Some buildings can change height and others can't. There's no easy way to visually see what you did or are doing as you build. 4) Some of the buildings won't work on certain tiles, meaning you have to rearrange the entire factory for some odd glitch. \n\nShit... Everywhere. \nFor some reason, toilets wouldn't work in some rooms. I tried building extra toilets, moving the toilets, changing the poop piping... They just kept shitting everywhere. Once they start shitting everywhere, the mood goes down and they shit more. And then they throw it ALL OVER THE FACTORY. Cleaning poop is annoying, as you have to pick up each one at a time and put it in the incinerator. \n\nCopy and Paste\nThe building copy and paste causes the most building glitches. While the poop was the most annoying glitch, this is what made me have to stop. Sometimes, entire machines would stop working and wouldn't work anywhere that a room was every copied. There are so many irregulatirities that it's impossible to debug, as all of the sudden folks are walking through walls.\n\nOverall, I'd say that simulation lovers will likely enjoy this game, even for the steep price. Although for $25 I am going to be very salty if there isn't major improvements to the game before release. More casual players may want to wait for more updates or a sale. \n","timestamp_created":1605014048,"timestamp_updated":1605014048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504570424556732178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0NmS2fUCcqnFrQI="}
