I hope to see more from Calebula Studios.  I'm typically more of an RPG, guns and magic kind of gamer.  Every now and then you just can't beat a good game of basketball and thought that I would give it a try.  The physics aspect is working well.   The gameplay is intuitive.  I mean, its basketball.  It will be interesting to see what updates will bring.  Maybe consider adding more arcade type or mini games?  Regardless, keep after it and I look forward to future updates.","timestamp_created":1529880185,"timestamp_updated":1529880185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545293271541595459","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1529936567,"developer_response":"I am currently working on a few arcade maps and updates that are bug fixes, graphical or just adding more content!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4iuH9meQCeaONpAE="}
