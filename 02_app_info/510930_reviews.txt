Next to Blaze Rush, this is one of the best examples of a simple aspect game. It's probably my favourite shooter... not because the graphics are over the top, though I'd definitely say they are good. But this is a game that gets your adrenaline going. A little practice will amaze your friends the first time out. It will only last for 5 minutes at a time, but you will want to play over and over again. If you can manage to start hitting early, the spawn mechanism will have you under intense fire quickly. The only real drawback that I can see is the inability for me to switch hands, which being the southpaw, I want to do. \nStill, one of my all time VR faves.","timestamp_created":1604375393,"timestamp_updated":1604375393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rraOxvUCcen5qwI="}
