The games a bit short, with a limited number of 'episodes', but I'd say what's already there is enough to make it worth the price of admission.\n\nSide note: Make sure to read the store description to find out what order you should play the episodes in, it's not completely clear in-game.\n\n([url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39309883-Indie-Bullet-Point-Reviews/]Indie Bullet Point Reviews[/url])","timestamp_created":1606221555,"timestamp_updated":1607635951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543676674365997314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42bukp/YCeNSdsAI="}
