    review: "I purchased this software in 2016 so I could use it with Elite Dangerous.\
      \ Elite has so many things to do in game and some of it can be really easily\
      \ automated. After 2 years of using this software I am done with it. Understand,\
      \ even though it says I have used it for 14 hours, it is more like 1,700 hours,\
      \ the same amount I have played Elite.\n\nSo I just spent about 2 hours trying\
      \ to get this software to do 2 actions at the same time but on different timers.\
      \ I tried to do it in one macro, I tried to do it in 2 macros that activated\
      \ by a third. Nothing worked. \n\nI have also occasionally had problems where\
      \ it would not recognize a command no matter how I said it. I don't know if\
      \ it is the software or Microsoft's windows speech recognition but it is frustrating\
      \ when you are trying to stop your ship from being destroyed and it won't do\
      \ the command you have tried 10 times in every way you can. Even worse is having\
      \ to contort your mouth towards your headset mic to see if it will recognize\
      \ it better by speaking like a former Canadian Prime Minister.\n\nIn less than\
      \ 1/2 an hour I just did what I wanted to do in Voice Attack Demo. This says\
      \ to me that either, the interface, functionality and capabilities are severely\
      \ lacking or the publishers ability to fund the creation of those features has\
      \ ended. I really don't want to spend the money on yet another voice recognition\
      \ software but honestly, I would rather do that than be continually frustrated.\n\
      \nI was hoping that the \"community\" would have answers to my problems, but\
      \ it seems that I have been the only one \"developing\" a profile for elite.\
      \ All the others either are really basic or have borrowed my commands. Additionally\
      \ I know a profile that is already prebuilt with a lot of the functions for\
      \ Elite already figured out. I really wish in this instance that I had gone\
      \ with the crowd a long time ago.\n\nFor anyone thinking of buying this software,\
      \ don't, go with voice attack."
