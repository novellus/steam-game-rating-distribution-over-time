    review: 'Great dock: lightweight app with lovely design! But there is still room
      for improvement:

      1. Would be nice to have an option to always start Dennkind Dock in minimalistick
      mode;

      2. Another useful thing will be an option to show/hide the dock not only with
      hotkey, but also hiding it automatically and showing it by placing a cursor
      near the screen border;

      3. The library should have a more convenient editor that would allow changing
      icons and specifying launch parameters for applications;

      4. I believe, grid sticking for desctop containers would be another good option;

      5. Left/right screen border placement;

      6. Prohibiting the launch of multiple copies of the dock application.


      I wish further improvement to Dennkind Dock!'
