    review: I saw this on youtube, and was captivated right away. There is something
      that reminds me of some Studio Ghibli movies, like "Nausicaa of the Valley of
      the Wind". Excellent premise and well executed art, I just bought this to support
      the artist, with hopes that we'll see more.
