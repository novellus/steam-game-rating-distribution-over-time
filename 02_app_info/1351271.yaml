    review: Don't bother with this shit. electric motor, noisier than a 40 year old
      2 stroke, spinning rod, with the eyes on top of the rod? animations on electric
      motor, are all wrong. you can't even see the lure properly on the selection
      screen. fuck my life, how is dovetail, this bad at making fishing content.
