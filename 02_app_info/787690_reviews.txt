It looks a little like Into The Eagles Nest for Commodore 64 8-bit computer. Can be played as co-op with one moving and one typing numbers and hits enter when there are enemies withing ammo range. Shooting is auto aim, since aiming with moving and calculating is just too much of challenge. \n\nCons: The game is windowed only and the high score list seems to update one game too late.\n\nDevelopment idea: Enemy friendly fire on would make this game more tactic and realism. You could lure enemies to crossfire each other and dodge their fire yourself.","timestamp_created":1609599489,"timestamp_updated":1609599489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vuLm4fYCevHfvwI="}
