I like puzzle games and this is certainly a puzzle. For just 79p it is a bargain. Yes, it is repetitive, but so are traditional mazes.  If you like to do a maze and want a new challenge then this is the game for you.  If you are not into puzzle games then look elsewhere!","timestamp_created":1593901559,"timestamp_updated":1593901559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zfX7jfMCdJbtkgI="}
