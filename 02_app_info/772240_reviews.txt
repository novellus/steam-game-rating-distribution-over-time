I enjoyed much of the game but I couldn’t help but notice some things don’t add up. You can effect various stats with your choices throughout the game such as kindness; bravery; loyalty; etc but and they will in turn mean you won’t be able to complete certain tasks in certain manners. I like that idea but in practice sometimes the game picks weird things to not allow me to do. For instance I had a very high kindness rating so at one point when I want to burn down a shed to cause a distraction the game said I failed because I was too nice. Another time I wanted to lie to a person and had the same issue, I was too kind to pull it off. Later on though I could literally murder a character in cold blood and the game was cool with it. I loved the story; I loved the interaction between different characters and I enjoyed the game overall but it’s cause and effect from the stats often felt broken. There is still enjoyment to be had though. The game has no graphics or audio so it has to get you to imagine the characters and locations and it does a great job describing them. I also felt that despite the system being broken that I could make the character my own for the most part. My only other issue was that your health could drop if you got injured from fights but at no point could I find a way to heal myself, not even back on the ship.\n\n\tI played Treasure Seekers of Lady Luck on Linux. The game didn’t crash on me once. I didn’t notice any spelling errors. There is no manual save system, the auto saves every page and upon exit. The game isn’t long enough to make this an issue and does make the choices you make feel more important as you must restart the game to change them. My system RAM usage during play was 2.4GB; my CPU usage was at 2%;  and my VRAM usage was at 506MB.\n\n\tOverall this is a solid visual novel. It’s positives outweigh the negatives. If you enjoy other games from Choice of Games then you will probably enjoy this. I finished the game in just under 2 hours. I paid $3.39 CAD for it and can say it is easily worth $5.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n\nMy System:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 19.2.2 |  Manjaro 18.1.2 | Mate 1.22.2 | Kernel 5.3.7-2-MANJARO","timestamp_created":1572674704,"timestamp_updated":1572674704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583038806915283203","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqPKtle4CfrLE1gE="}
