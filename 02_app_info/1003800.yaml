    review: "I'm almost positive I bought this game before the soundtrack was released,\
      \ and then got it for free way later on.\n\n[h1]Little Big Mortal Gang Kombat\
      \ Beasts Planet [/h1]\nI'm not sure what this soundtrack was trying to be. Like\
      \ I gave the game a good several hours of play, and this music is just not vibing.\
      \ With anything.\n[olist]\n[*] Gang Beast Days: It sounds like they wanted to\
      \ recreate some sort of whimsical feeling of Molecule Media's 'Little Big Planet.'\
      \ Worst of all, the main theme song, which includes creepy and untalented children\
      \ chanting the name of the game, and even spelling it. Which in turn gives it\
      \ a sudden Mortal Kombat meets Little Big Planet. Why? \n[*] Containers of Joy:\
      \ I don't think Little Big Planet was a good choice for a game where you can\
      \ drop living beings, whom I would presume to be somewhat human, into meat grinders,\
      \ and incinerators. This song is in relation to explosions\n[*] Subway Sly:\
      \ Oops, you committed a war crime... or a hefty fine in my case, stop jumping\
      \ in front of trains.\n[*] Wheel 2 Electric Boogaloo: Sounds like its trying\
      \ to be the CDPR building tumbling down as Cyberpunk2077 is released.\n[*] Chutes\
      \ Ahoy: Another sound of CDPR's PR crumbling as complaints roll in.\n[*] Cooling\
      \ Dawn: Decent Chiptune song, no real complaints, reminds me of Sonic's famous\
      \ snow level, you know the one.\n[*] Gondal Getdown: This song causes a visceral\
      \ reaction, as the level this song is attuned to, is horrifyingly difficult\
      \ in a game about physicis based fights and ring outs. Sounds like bubble pop.\n\
      [*] Buoy Beautiful: This one feels like they were making a synthwave Donkey\
      \ Kong Country Song, like it a lot.\n[*] Fans Forever: Very Rapid upbeat fast\
      \ pace and happy song, with another synthwave vibe.\n[*] Grind On: Remember\
      \ She, the EDM artist? This has that LBP chanting with a song that could fit\
      \ right next to Super Nova.\n[*] \n\n\nTL;DR\nWhy the fuck would you make this?\
      \ Skip this crap.\nOr don't I don't care outside of my own enjoyment."
