Its a bit confusing as to where to find the pictures (in the \"Blossoms Bloom Brightest\" steam directory), it would be conveniant if you could just view it in game as well. \n\nIts too bad there aren't any more meaningful DLC's. Although, for a free game like this, its  a nice way to support the content creators. \n","timestamp_created":1495350199,"timestamp_updated":1495350199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513180673122406006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4raj0lNwCfOfMeQ=="}
