I love the art style and the combat is interestingly fun at best. There are some control issues were you feel very slow and things feel like they don't respond proper, but it's not something that takes too much away from the gameplay. \nNo regrets on the purchase.","timestamp_created":1581467781,"timestamp_updated":1581467781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546500205993652344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Oi0m/ACdL/a8QE="}
