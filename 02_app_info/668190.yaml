      Sorry to hear you had issues with the game!

      We haven''t seen any stress or downtime on our servers this week.  Was there
      a specific error code or issue you received so we can try and figure out what
      went wrong?'

    review: We weren't able to have much fun, due to the mobile controller not refreshing
      for correct prompts about 2/5 times. Fine game when it was functioning correctly,
      but felt a bit light for purchasing alone.
