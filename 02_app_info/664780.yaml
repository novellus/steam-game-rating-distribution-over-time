    about_the_game: What if you could live your life over again?<br><br>In this text-based
      interactive fiction, you choose what happens next. It's in the style of pick-a-path
      gamebooks, but with over a thousand multiple-choice questions, it's much longer
      and deeper than traditional gamebooks. <i>Alter Ego</i> starts at birth and
      ends at death, including two substantially different versions, depending on
      whether you choose to be male or female. <br><br>Will you grow up to be confident
      and happy? Will you fight with bullies, or befriend them? Will you find a date
      to the senior prom? Will you marry and have kids, or start your own business
      and become a millionaire? The choice is yours.<br><br>This game will change
      your life.<br><br>(<i>Alter Ego</i> was originally published in 1986 for the
      Commodore 64, MS-DOS, Apple II, and Macintosh. The current edition of the <i>Alter
      Ego</i> game is a production of Choose Multiple LLC. This edition includes an
      updated interface and fixes bugs in the original version of the game, but the
      content of the game hasn't changed from the original 1986 version of the game.)
