      \ combine to make a very addictive experience that keeps you coming back for\
      \ just one more go.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.alphabetagamer.com/skycadia-alpha-demo/\"\

      \ you have been charmed, since its release last year, by the excessively cute\
      \ A Short Hike, its leisurely stroll and its art of hovering without constraints.\
      \ Skycadia, the indie game of the day, has this in common with the title of\
      \ Adam Robinson-Yu that it also embodies a bird, adept at flying at more or\
      \ less high speed, all in a colorful retro aesthetic.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://thepixelpost.com/expresso/inde-matin-skycadia\"\

    review: "This is by far the most exciting thrill ride of a highscore leaderboard\
      \ battling game I've played in many years.\n\nAt the start, you are set to begin\
      \ unlocking the other pilots and weapons (3 of each). It may seem like a huge\
      \ hurdle, but once you get your mind past the unlocks and just concentrate on\
      \ the leaderboard, it becomes all or nothing.\n\nSet in a retro 90's look with\
      \ it's vibrant landscapes and scan lines, you feel right at home. (Well I do).\
      \ \n\nThe chiptune music sets the scene for the 3 stages the game throws at\
      \ you. First a light tune as the first wave of enemy ships spawn in, then a\
      \ faster arrangement as the flying centipedes swoop around and finally the boss\
      \ music kicks, and you know by then, things are gonna go down.\n\nIn no way\
      \ does it sound annoying or repetitive (I'm currently 10hrs in), the only annoyance\
      \ is when you die and have to start again from scratch...but which you do immediately\
      \ :D\n\nRage quitting is easy to do too, but like all rage quitting games, like\
      \ Super Hexagon... you always feel the need to give it one more try.\n\nAnother\
      \ awesome thing is that the dev is constantly engaging with the fan base and\
      \ developing the game based on feedback.\nWe've seen more worlds to fly around\
      \ in and new ways to reach new heights on the board.\n\nThe controls are tight\
      \ too and no death feels cheap.\n\nIf you love highscorers, there's no better\
      \ title than Skycadia to fullfill your need.\n\nDo I reccomend this game?\n\n\
      HELL YEAH!!! :D"
