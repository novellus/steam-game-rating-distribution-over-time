    review: "It took me a little while to get the feel for this game, but after I\
      \ did I really liked it. Unfortunately it suffers from a bit of lack of direction.\
      \ Eventually I figured out what to do by basically going everywhere. Now I'm\
      \ kinda stuck again. Not much of a wiki community for a game with 5 reviews.\
      \ \n\nIt's fun and I hope the game isn't abandoned. Haven't seen an update since\
      \ it came out?"
