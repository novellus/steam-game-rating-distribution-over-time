    about_the_game: In this VR exclusive game, travel through clockwork and use your
      gaze to dodge obstacles, collect perks and avoid touching the Mechanism. <br><br>With
      a variety of upbeat music tracks, infinite levels, epic scale clockwork rooms
      and obstacles, you'll enjoy travelling at high speed and testing your reactions
      and focus. Keep your eyes ahead of the game, don't touch anything and survive
      the Mechanism as long as you can.<br><br>This game is an infinite runner style
      game. With each level complete, the speed will go faster, the obstacles will
      increase and the environment changes.<br><br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">REVIEWS</h2></strong><br>&quot;Games
      that only require head movement as you go down a seemingly never ending tunnel
      are two a penny in the world of VR, but yet, without VR they are pretty much
      useless. So in comes Dark Mechanism to bring a new slant on the genre with its
      dark clockwork gears style of tunnel, all the while trying to move your head
      fast enough to avoid the bright red incoming projectiles.<br>There is no controller
      needed here other than maybe an Oculus Remote to start the app in the first
      place. Just move your head and avoid the scenery. Not only do the graphics looks
      pretty good and trippy, but the music also helps to set the scene as well as
      the pace of the game. Look, avoid, try and survive!&quot;<br><i>VR Shop</i>
