      \ cusp of graduating high school. <br />\r\nShe is the lone passenger of a slowly\
      \ dying train station. As a practical young adult, she doesn\u2019t see why\
      \ her family couldn\u2019t have just moved closer to the high school she is\
      \ attending. She is rather embarrassed by the whole situation and the attention\
      \ it garners her. She just wants to graduate and go to a university in the big\
      \ city. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, life in the sticks isn\u2019t all that\
      \ it seems. While riding the train home, Mariko ends up at an unexpected stop,\

    reviews: "\u201CAll in all, this was an interesting visual novel experience that\
      \ was evocative and engaging. When Our Journey Ends felt different than any\
      \ of the visual novels I\u2019ve played before, yet familiar as if it were an\
      \ old fairy tale. The story as a whole, including the extra chapters, is something\
      \ I am very glad I got to experience. I found myself more and more attached\
      \ to the characters, wanting to know more. Wanting more stories. I felt happy\
      \ when I finished this visual novel.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://nardio.net/2017/02/24/when-our-journey-ends-a-visual-novel-review/\"\

    review: "I like this visual novel and its nice that it had voice acting. The story\
      \ is quite unique and very well put. \nHowever, some of the voice acting doesn't\
      \ match the text or it has been fast track ahead the text that comes on. It\
      \ very enjoyable even though of that error. \nI have played it and the achievement\
      \ do come up in the actual game but steam hasn't recognised that I have earned\
      \ the achievement, which is a shame. Maybe I'm not hitting the right choice\
      \ for the achievement but I will experiment and see. \n\nI would like to see\
      \ more games like this one. Not with the same story of course but with the traditional\
      \ Japanese character designs. I will like to play it again."
