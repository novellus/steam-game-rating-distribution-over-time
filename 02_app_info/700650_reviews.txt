The ball doesn't quite move like a real ball in miniature golf. The courses are pretty basic. It doesn't have any real VR settings other than putter length.\n\nOverall this seems more like cash grab than a game the developer cares about.","timestamp_created":1584911080,"timestamp_updated":1584911080,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpPuDgvECfvqV+gE="}
