    review: I played this game on my HTC VIVE CE. Overall game experience is good.
      Simple but pleasant. This is the first vr game I met that includes relativity.
      As my speed increases, objects become narrower. And even turned an angle. In
      theory, a player approaching the speed of light can actually see the back of
      the planet. There are still many improvements can be made.
