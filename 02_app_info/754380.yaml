    review: I can't recommend this game at this state. It's only borderline playable
      (buildings have no collision detection, so you walk through them, test is shown
      through everything, the "heist" doesn't work properly, as you can't really take
      out the jewlery out of the cases, game feels to stutter a little bit, but no
      actual framdrops occur), it takes not even an hour to beat everything that has
      been implemented for now it seems, the story is kind of flat at the moment,
      voice acting is done by text-to-speech programs, and overall it kind of feels
      more a chore than a game currently. I waited over a month from my initial purchase
      and subsequent last playthrough to check if the developer would come up with
      a new update anytime soon, but there has been radio silence so far. So I would
      advise everyone to wait and see how it is going to develop than to but it at
      the moment.
