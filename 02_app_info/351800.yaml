    about_the_game: Being a developer for games is difficult. It's even harder when
      you are an indie developer. In Dev Guy, you play the roll of Warren (an independent
      developer) just trying to get his game on the app store before his game license
      expires. It sounds simple, but becomes complex quickly when his car goes missing,
      and his data disappears with it. Will warren get his car back? Join Warren as
      he tries to retrieve his game data while solving puzzles, hacking other developer's
      computers, breaking windows, and yelling at his friend Cabe. If you've played
      classic puzzle adventure games and feel the need for more, this game might be
      right up your alley. Using the power of the UDK, Dev Guy brings you the most
      graphically underwhelming game of this year.
