Honestly I can only really recommend this game if its on sale. First praise where praise is due, the game controls fine, the UI is slick and ramming your ship into the enemies feels good. But other than that the game feels really generic.\n\nAll of the game blurs together since none of the backgrounds are distinct from one another, and the bosses and miniboses are copy and pasted multiple times. The game drags on too long (Ironic for someone that likes beefier games, I know) with its loops, the enemy variety feels almost non-existent, the translation is terrible and the bullet patterns are plain not very fun to dodge in the first place. And a pet peevee I have is that the art style doesn't work in this game unlike in trouble witches.\n\nIf you want to get a good Studio Siesta game go buy Trouble Witches. The game is way better than this one","timestamp_created":1609009200,"timestamp_updated":1609044582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5/uh0fYCf8m9vQI="}
