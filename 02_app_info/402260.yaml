    review: "A murder has taken place, will more happen?  Use your investigative skills\
      \ to unlock the mystery of the murder of Harris Bullard and uncover the enigma\
      \ of his mysterious invention.  Who murdered the strange professor?  Was it\
      \ the estranged ex-wife, the new assistant, the former research partner, the\
      \ errand boy, or something else entirely?\n\nDead Secret is a first-person horror\
      \ mystery set in rural Kansas in the 1960s.  Playing as a reporter you investigate\
      \ a death of the prominent professor; searching his home for clues by clicking\
      \ items, sometimes combining them, and progressing from there.  For the most\
      \ part you will be moving from room to room solving puzzles and finding items\
      \ that will unlock further mysteries within the house.  The puzzles are relatively\
      \ straightforward and require some thinking and deductive reasoning along with\
      \ a good eye for clues.\n\nWhile the world is three dimensional, the game sometimes\
      \ feels like a point-and-click game; for example, moving from one spot to another\
      \ requires clicking in that direction after which the game will walk you over\
      \ there.  The traveling method feels a bit cumbersome and not very intuitive\
      \ as I found myself trying to walk around on my own quite often.  It is important\
      \ to note that the game was originally designed for VR, and as such, some of\
      \ the features seem a bit off.  With that aspect of the game known, Dead Secret\
      \ can be played without VR\u2014which was my experience with the game.\n\nThe\
      \ story of Dead Secret is very well done.  Monologues and found papers all tell\
      \ the story and deepen the mystery\u2014for those who like to blast past the\
      \ reading part of games you probably will not get what is going on but for those\
      \ who take the time to read the notes you are in for a real treat.  I enjoyed\
      \ learning more about the different off-screen characters and was thoroughly\
      \ engrossed with the mystery.\n\nAchievements are easy to get\u2014with Dead\
      \ Secret being the first game where I didn\u2019t have to replay the entire\
      \ story to get the alternate endings; you just need to start from the last game\
      \ save.  Sadly, there are only five achievements for Dead Secret and I would\
      \ have liked to have seen more achievements but was grateful for what was given.\n\
      \nThe controls were okay but understanding that the game was originally designed\
      \ for VR\u2014they are not bad.  I found myself going back and forth between\
      \ the keyboard and the controller with little change in efficiency or ease.\n\
      \nDead Secret is not a bad game\u2026I found it quite enjoyable.  And while\
      \ short; the game does lend itself to the horror mystery genre and I found myself\
      \ invested in the enigma and was delightfully terrified with several sequences.\
      \  I recommend this game for those who like either genres or for those looking\
      \ for a quick game to play."
