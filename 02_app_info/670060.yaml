    about_the_game: "Defenders of Ekron in an Adventure/Shmup game that mixes the\
      \ classic action of a Shmup and the exploration of an Adventure game, including\
      \ dungeons and a sci-fi experience. You take the role of Eneas, a young and\
      \ bold cadet that has trained his entire life to pilot his Anakim, an advanced\
      \ mech capable of absorbing and transforming the energy around it into a special\
      \ ability, but something goes wrong and Eneas is forced to join an experimental\
      \ program to face the Renegades, a group of rogue Anakim pilots, that threaten\
      \ to destroy the nation by leading a civil war. With features like 360\xB0 shooting\
      \ range, unique scenarios to discover, exploration modes to analyze the environment,\
      \ a powerful shield, and different upgradable Combat modes, you must defend\
      \ the Technocratic Republic of Ekron, but be careful, for dark secrets await\
      \ and the limits between right and wrong will slowly fade. Listen to your instinct,\
      \ because revolution starts within."
