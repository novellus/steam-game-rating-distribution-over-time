    review: "You know this was surprisingly well done. I got it on sale for 69 cents\
      \ (Lol) and unlike some games I've purchased at that price, this one was legit\
      \ worth it. It was a bit challenging because of the timing for jumps which if\
      \ far better then when the game is hard due to poorly implemented mechanics.\
      \ Fun little game for a quick upload 10/10 would buy again... Just at the less\
      \ then 1 dollar price. \n\nIf ya'll want to see a little game play then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE09NExhA5o&t=2s\n\
      \nEnjoy like I did and thanks for chilling with Icy!"
