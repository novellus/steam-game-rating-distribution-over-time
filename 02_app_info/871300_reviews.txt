In addition, the game is very slow, especially when you have to solve the maze : you work out a solution quickly, but then, it takes a lot of time to implement it. Even then, there is not a lot of content : ~30 minutes should be plenty enough.\nOverall, I cannot recommend spending both time and money on this game.","timestamp_created":1604230495,"timestamp_updated":1604230495,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sdflwfUCconEqwI="}
