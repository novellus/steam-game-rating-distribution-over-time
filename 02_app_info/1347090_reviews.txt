Very fun yet challenging. The second mission took me a couple tries to make sure both my HARMs hit and I had enough weapons to still finish the mission. I would love to see Supercarrier support added which would give me an excuse to play back through the campaign.","timestamp_created":1609794763,"timestamp_updated":1609794763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j9fP5/YCdbTBwAI="}
