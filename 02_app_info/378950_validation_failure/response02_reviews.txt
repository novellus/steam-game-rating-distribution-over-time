It's unfortunate that composer Gareth Coker doesn't seem to have much offering of this anywhere, not even on his [url=https://garethcoker.bandcamp.com/music]BandCamp[/url] alongside the Additional Soundtrack released with the Definitive Edition (I'd certainly be paying much more than the asking price if he did!).\n\nHowever, there are known lossless providers selling the music such as [url=http://tidal.com/gb/store/album/42804104]Tidal[/url] & [url=https://www.7digital.com/artist/gareth-coker/release/ori-and-the-blind-forest-original-soundtrack]7digital[/url] (The latter cheaper) in up to FLAC 16bit should you wish to have this music in lossless quality. Hopefully, these providers sell the music in your region.\n\nOn the bright side, the MP3s are all at 320kbps, so you are at least getting the highest quality out of them.\n\nThat said, it's not reason enough to even make me hesitate in strongly recommending this soundtrack. The music composed and performed for Ori & The Blind Forest is as utterly sublime as it is rich with emotion & passion (And often demanding of your tears).","timestamp_created":1434620946,"timestamp_updated":1515864610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.823776423931121826","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzcqk+OACfcP1Pg=="}
