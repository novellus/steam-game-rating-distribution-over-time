      \ searchin for good boss fights or just firin' some spells against everything\
      \ - go for it. The AI is well created and the world looks good, at first. Don't\

      \ new to the game. To get a building guide online is one way to make it easier\
      \ for you, or you just start learnin how to make good spells (which will take\
      \ time, and even if you got it, it's uncomfortable)\n\n-Graphics-\nFor a game\
      \ of 2014 you can see good graphics, but at some points you're back in 19xx.\
      \ One day you will walk through the endless areas of the game and hugh? Is this\
      \ Minecraft? And sometimes even the AI will appear with only half of the rendered\
      \ pixels that are necessary to identify what is coming. \n\n-AI-\ni like the\
      \ AI, so this is the one thing that makes fun - bash the AI which is made decent\
      \ IMO.\n\n-areas-\nyes, i have to talk about the areas. You will walk A LOT\
      \ through repetitive areas, which are LONG as hell. You got a desert, a swamp,\
      \ icy mountains etc. but its all the same, really. \n\n-Story-\nThe Story (and\
      \ i care a lot about the story of RPG) has good ideas, but the implementation\
      \ isn't good. So DON'T buy this game if you want a good story.\n\nWhat can i\
      \ say? It's just a shame that they haven't gave more time to process the game\
      \ properly. The game gets boring after some time and you will stop playin or\
      \ (like me) play it till the end because you paid money :(\n\nSo look for yourself,\
      \ or switch back to skyrim where you love the bugs - not like here. \n\n"
