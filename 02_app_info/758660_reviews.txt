My pc is a low end gaming laptop with a 1060 3 gb ram for vr and this game runs without any issues. the weapons feel great and have a nice kick to them and while the AI isnt too special the fact that you can switch the surface you are standing on gives this game a whole new way of thinking.  But the best part of this game are the grenades, these little balls of certain doom give you the ability to change their gravity setting enabeling you to throw them at a guy standing on the ceiling below you. the freedom is insane with those (but so is the blast radius so be carefull). all in all i would love to see this game be more popular as in my eyes it is a hidden gem. \n\nbut not all is positive. in the short while that i have played this game the floor gave way multiple times seemingly out of the blue. idk what caused it but you can notice that the early acces badge is required!\n\nall in all 8/10","timestamp_created":1608119975,"timestamp_updated":1608119975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xe/atfYCfKHXugI="}
