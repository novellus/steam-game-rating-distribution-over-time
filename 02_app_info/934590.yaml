    review: "This game strikes me like a very specific nightmare. \n\n It takes place\
      \ in an enclosed field of black.  It's almost impossible to see the walls, but\
      \ you can feel their presence.  You character runs clumsily, as though exhausted,\
      \ as blindingly white.. things chase after you relentelsessly.  Even when not\
      \ active, they lay on the field, the only illumination present.  There's nowhere\
      \ really to run, and the controls are awkward and stiff.\n\nWhen they catch\
      \ you, you are pushed down awkwardly as they flail.  Your character falls with\
      \ an odd animation.  It reminds me of time lapse footage of a decaying carcass.\
      \  The movement jerks, as joints seem to resist and then instantly go past their\
      \ normal limits.  The game then cuts you back to the title screen, giving you\
      \ a silent score in the bottom right.\n\nIn the game, you can wall jump and\
      \ there is a central circular pillar in the middle.  It's not hard to climb\
      \ up to the top and watch as the things accumulate below, running tirelessly\
      \ against the walls.  From this elevation you can see the sky, and the area\
      \ outside the field of black.  It's a simple environment: a somewhat reflective\
      \ surface, a skybox, and a distant red-orange light source.  It looks like a\
      \ sunset on a sea of glass.\n\nBut that's not all.  The game itself sits uneasily\
      \ in steam.  I think the title is \"Lamp Man Down\", but in the checkout and\
      \ installation it goes by different name.  I... honestly can't remember what\
      \ it was.  Did I forget?  Did I just imagine it?  I'm not sure.\n\nFinally,\
      \ the game activates SteamVR when it loads.  That's the only sound I can hear\
      \ when I play this game - the sound of my lightouses as they spin.  There's\
      \ no way this can be a VR game, it has to be some kind of weird bug.  Maybe\
      \ it's activating it by default?  The action in VR would make me sick as a dog,\
      \ there's just no way it's intended.  \n\nWhy did I even buy this game?  The\
      \ trailer just gave me anxiety and the other single review panned it pretty\
      \ hard.  When I was on the store page, I had that kind of feeling I sometimes\
      \ get, like I'm standing near the edge of a cliff, telling myself how I DEFINITELY\
      \ should not walk to the edge of that cliff and jump off.  It would ABSOLUTELY\
      \ be completely terrifying as I fall.  I MUST stand still and NOT take a running\
      \ jump.  ZERO movement in that direction.\n\nObviously the stakes were much\
      \ lower, so I hit the buy button.  As I listen to the lightouses whirr, I do\
      \ wonder.  What on earth could be going on in that headset?  But I don't think\
      \ I can look inside.  I dare not."
