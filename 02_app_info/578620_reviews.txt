I mean to relieve ur stress. \nbasically u're a gladiator and ur job is to kill all other gladiators.\nit's actually pretty satisfying, as this game avoiding the physics problem of sword/melee vr games problems, with the way that enemies got knocked flying when u hit them, and all the weapons got this wobbly bobbly effects on them to emphasize it.\n\nbut few problems keeps it to be satisfying, and even induce stress when it means to relieve stress :\n\n1. it's a heavy game. I couldnt play this game long wirelessly connected to my quest without lag (while I could play most other vr games smoothly wirelessly). I have to use cable link. well this one is actually just a light rant.\n\n2. while ur enemies could take some punishment (like u have to hit them at least 3 times on the head to get them dead), but when u got hit, no matter where, and only once, it automatically is a deadly hit. ur vision would get more and more narrow and dark, and in about 5 secs, if u dont kill anyone, u're dead. \n\n3. the wobbly weapons actually made it awkward sometimes. when u used weapons like spear, this problem really2 felt. it feels really2 awkward when u need to stab the spear and it's wobbly, and sometimes when it did stab, and it wont go out because it stabbed and would drag the enemies while the weapon still wobbly \n\nthere are a lot of weapons though to satisfy ur needs and for variety. \nwell, it's fun. so for the cost it asked, this is an easy recommend","timestamp_created":1605415686,"timestamp_updated":1610156112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiI+y8vYCc5K7rgI="}
