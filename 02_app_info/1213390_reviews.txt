That's FTL\n\nSo then you go out and buy a new one, from a slightly different company. \nIt's the same price, looks the same, feels the same, but it breaks worse then the first one did after the fifth or sixth use? That's Starship Inspector.\n\nIn truth, it has a lot of promise, but still needs some work. \nShielding needs to shield. \nThe price of some of the early upgrades need to drop.\nFire needs to not spread weirdly fast in an all metal vessel.\nThe UI for shops basically needs an overhaul, don't make me 'check out' stuff just let me hit the stuff and do it and go.\nThe quests probably need some fleshing out but the game is early access.\nThere needs to be a clear UI on the map for quests and the like.","timestamp_created":1609609524,"timestamp_updated":1609609524,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538381755352020264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsoaN4vYCdIbmvwI="}
