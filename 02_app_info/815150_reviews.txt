I've only played in Normal Mode so far, so I'm not sure how the difficulty scales. \n\nIn my 13 hours of playtime, I think I managed to do just about everything in the storyline and sidequests. I upgraded all the weapons (although the achievement appears to be bugged). The combat didn't feel like too much of a grind, there was a nice balance between progression, sidequests, and leveling. \n\nThe one thing that I did find myself wanting was a way to sort my inventory. I'd often get a dropped item and not always know if it was a weapon, armor, trinket, or accessory. Weapons have their own item menu, but everything else got lumped together. Additionally, it's not clear in the item navigation which character(s) can equip specific items a lot of the time, which means having to go through each character and trying to figure out if they're able to equip the new item (and determining whether that item is armor, trinket, or accessory). \n\nThe main storyline wasn't too long or convoluted. And the romance aspect is barely there via a handful of exchanges; at least one of which doesn't occur in the main story, and you could miss it entirely if you [spoiler]don't go to Ruth's house with your party when Alduin reopens the gates for you[/spoiler]. The fact that the romance isn't forced actually feels more natural, since the focus remains primarily on the adventure story while the party's relationships develop. \n\nDefinitely recommend this game for people who enjoy old-school JRPGs.","timestamp_created":1609358677,"timestamp_updated":1609358677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wJLQ2vYCdeXwvgI="}
