    about_the_game: "Ireland is famous for big bream fishing and Lough Kerr is one\
      \ of the reasons why, as not only is there every chance you could catch a new\
      \ PB, but you could also beat the national record! This perfectly formed venue\
      \ of 18 acres is steeped in history and feels like time has stood still with\
      \ ancient stone walls and mature foliage whilst the superb water quality makes\
      \ it perfect for big bream to grow on. The lough is visited by some of the best\
      \ anglers in Europe who are all chasing the elusive records it holds including\
      \ \u2018Banshee\u2019 that has been caught at an incredible 21lbs.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nAlthough all the attention is on the bream fishing, this lake also\
      \ holds carp to just under 25lbs and good sized tench, roach and rudd. There\
      \ are also three single player tournaments for you to master and three career\
      \ mode events, as well as five new achievements that come with this venue."

    review: 'Another beautiful water for fsw.


      There are HUGE bream in here, if you can find them.


      Paired with talon fishery (which is awesome) this is a fantastic twin lake pack.
