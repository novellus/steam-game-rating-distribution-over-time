    reviews: "\u201C'Red Matter' showcases impressive worldbuilding, a knack for high\
      \ degree of polish, and an engaging enough story to make this a single sitting\
      \ game worth at very least three hours of your time. Puzzles aren't terribly\
      \ difficult, but usually come to a satisfying enough resolution, and always\
      \ feel necessary to the overall narrative. While the game's commander, a voice\
      \ over guide, can grated on my nerves, it's an easy defect to ignore in the\
      \ face of an overall excellent sci-fi thriller adventure.\u201D<br>8.3 / 10\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Road To VR</a><br><br>\u201CIt is pretty\
      \ damn clear by now that I am impressed with this game. When it comes to design,\
      \ this team nailed the most important aspect of a VR game. It has to feel natural.\
      \ This goes into every area of game design, from world building, to narrative,\
      \ all the way to how the player interacts with a button on a desk lamp. Red\
      \ Matter is a shining example of what making the correct design decisions, for\
      \ the story your trying to sell, looks like.\u201D<br>9.6 / 10 \u2013 <a href=\"\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR the Gamers</a><br><br>\u201CAll in\
      \ all, Red Matter is a very high calibre VR experience, neatly weaving its story\
      \ and puzzle elements together. It by no means perfect, following the line of\
      \ other puzzles in VR that are seemingly unable to offer plenty of reasons to\
      \ come back for more. So like a good meal take it slowly and savour the moment.\u201D\
