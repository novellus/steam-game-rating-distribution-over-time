There aren't any other games quite like this, and I am at a loss at how to describe the game, 2.5 hack-and-slash / brawl? With an overworld to explore, a house/guild to upgrade and units to recruit, defend the city from raids and go explore POIs that spawn throughout the overworld/world map, you have wandering enemies and raid groups that you can find. I'm still very early in the game as I was when I played it on Desura, so I'll update this as I go along - but if you're after something new, this is definitely something to support. Also includes the ability to host servers or play singleplayer.","timestamp_created":1567042818,"timestamp_updated":1567042818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw/fnB7ewCfMik0QE="}
