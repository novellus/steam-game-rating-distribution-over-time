Performance seems correct, but I can't get perfect fuel burn yet.\n\nThe light effects at night could be better, especially the passenger ones. And it would be nice to have better external textures. But overall I recommend it, and it has the usual Carenado details.\n\n\nIf you are not sure about what plane you want, I have to say there are better options from Carenado for a similar price","timestamp_created":1461544627,"timestamp_updated":1461544627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567699849605560303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s6W2pdQCcN+lVg=="}
