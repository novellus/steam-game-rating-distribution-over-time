    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Blind Bubsy Fans [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]\
      \  \nI'm just confused on exactly what the audience for this game is supposed\
      \ to be. I mean, unlike some of the other games in the series, Paws on Fire\
      \ is at least functional. But there's just a lot missing from the experience.\
      \ With the writing and the jokes put in the background of the auto-runner, the\
      \ gameplay is supposed to be holding up the game by itself: and it doesn't do\
      \ that well. The thing is, auto-runners can work if there's enough variety in\
      \ terms of reactions: forcing you to work against the games level design and\
      \ hopefully you don't react in the wrong way. But the repetitiveness of Paws\
      \ on Fire, forcing you to replay levels several times (even though the characters\
      \ are different) ends up really grinding your gears rather quickly. Even the\
      \ character differences don't do that much to feel like you're just hitting\
      \ a jump button at the right time, and there's no thought needed in terms of\
      \ the gameplay. \n\nBut it's the soul of Bubsy's character being regulated to\
      \ the sideline that makes this feel more of a skinned version of Bubsy more\
      \ then anything else. I wonder why this game exists honestly, this doesn't feel\
      \ like Bubsy first of all, but more like a game wearing the skin of bubsy. He's\
      \ not exactly put into the spotlight, but he also doesn't feel like himself\
      \ either. His charm is gone, which is weird to say but he needed to talk a LOT\
      \ more. It doesn't help that the series staples such as his wit and the unique\
      \ death animations aren't here, and the bit trip runner type effects can really\
      \ not work well for the presentation of the story elements. Even when getting\
      \ to the second world, some of the presentation's reuse is obvious, and you\
      \ can't help but wonder why what the game was supposibly delayed for. \n\nThere's\
      \ just not enough from the Runner3 developer to really justify that price point.\
      \ Maybe something a lot smaller,but even then there are better experiences out\
      \ there without the Bubsy layer. \n\nEven for \n\n[b]Gameplay Footage: [/b]\
      \  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_c3Yatk9CE\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] The character and colors in the artwork is reasonable and there's\
      \ nothing that doesn't work (well mostly) from the presentation.\n[*] The Armadillo\
      \ levels provide a good change of pace.\n[*] Controls are reasonable and there's\
      \ a reasonable responsiveness for each of the characters.\n[*] The different\
      \ characters in theory should have added variety to the game's length. They\
      \ do.... a tiny bit.\n[*] Music tracks aren't bad and sound design isn't either.\
      \  \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Level Design gets repetitive\
      \ very quickly and the game doesn't do enough to keep up variety in the first\
      \ hour or so. Within 20 minutes, you're sitting there wondering why you'd continue\
      \ to play. \n[*] Repetition, Repetition, Repetition, even beyond having to do\
      \ levels over again with different characters, it's the same patterns for jumping\
      \ and dodging that bat you have to deal with. \n[*] The writings and jokes are\
      \ god awful for a Bubsy game. I mean, that's when you get them, but where's\
      \ the cleverness in the puns? Sure, level names are fine, but where's the actual\
      \ character of Bubsy that people are here for?\n[*] Further more those lines\
      \ get repeated very quickly and make you wonder why more wasn't recorded. You'll\
      \ want to shut sound off entirely....if you need to.\n[*] I mean, the game has\
      \ a section or two that's ok, but challenge isn't the games strong suit. And\
      \ the lack of difficulty can wear really fast.\n[*] UFO girls levels are just.....time\
      \ wasters. Barely any challenge. \n[*] No unique animations for death really\
      \ stands out when the death animation for running into bees, sawblades, and\
      \ creatures are all the same.\n[*] Just the price in general. I'm having trouble\
      \ justifying the price tag, even with the 20% sale for the first seven days,\
      \ for what you get here gameplay/game wise. It's a steal....for the seller.\
      \ \n[*] Some of the energy effects really hurt your eyes if you stare at them\
      \ for a period of time and can really use it toned down. \n[*] Costumes and\
      \ cosemetics feel reasonably lazy. Like they need a dose of life in them. \n\
      [/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed,\
