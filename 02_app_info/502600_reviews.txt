The writing is pretty bland despite the interesting concepts, the narrators are hella annoying, and some routes the demons are completely put out of the picture! Which makes me feel like they tried to cram too many different games in one.\n\nAll the routes were interesting enough, and Einear's, Blanche's, and Jan's routes were my favourites, though Tymo was pretty funny. The game doesn't do much to convince me to believe our main character genuinely falls in love with them because so far there isn't an real reason for her too beyond selecting that for her. It's very artificial. \n\nThe demon world and concept could've been interesting, or the thriller of Jan's story, but oh well.\n\nI'll be interested if you end up making the actual different games you seem to want to with this one. \n\nI wish I hadn't played it to try and get my money's worth though. 4/10 please spend your money on better written visual novels","timestamp_created":1565362582,"timestamp_updated":1565362582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwn664u+wCeMCE0AE="}
