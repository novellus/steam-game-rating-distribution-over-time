      \ really well-done too, however, with a very well-written story and some interesting\

    review: '6/10 - "Not bad at all!"

      Brain usage: low


      Pros: enjoyable read, multiple valid paths, decent atmosphere/flavor , combat
      is smooth/fast, some funny choices


      Cons: the artwork (typical for these titles), a bit too cheesy writing, the
      story is uninspiring albeit not unoriginal, no sense of urgency or tension,
      low immersion, multiple decisions do not really matter beside flavor (quite
      typical for titles after 2010 both books and video games)


      One of the better ones from gamebookadventures.com - however, nothing particularly
      memorable. Don''t get me wrong, you can play this through once or twice, but
      if you are looking for the old-school nostalgia from the classical Fighting
      Fantasy books, nothing ever really came close to those. "Those were the days"
      - Damn, I''m becoming a boomer...


      Technically, this is the 5th book from the "series", but there isn''t anything
      in particular connecting the total 12 books.


      The writer is Andrew Wright, the author of Beyond the Pit (an Advanced Fighting
      Fantasy title, in the world of Titan).


      Generally, I''m thankful for these books (the writers, the publishers) to try
      to keep alive the tradition in a world where younglings would never bother with
      something like this. However, the Golden Age of these books is arguably gone.'
