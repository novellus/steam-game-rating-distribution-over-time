For two bucks you get access to the game's soundtrack and a whole boatload of artwork from the game, as well as the bonus side game \"Girl's Graveyard.\"\n\nYou play as Kiki in an arcade type experience where you must dodge ghosts and bats on narrowly designed maps to get pieces of candy. There isn't much of a story at first, but patient players will be rewarded (and trust me when I say you gotta be patient- these sections can be infuriating, so infuriating that it took me several years to come back and beat this part). This seems to expand the universe of Close Your Eyes in some pretty interesting ways, and if I'm not mistaken, it ties into one of Yai's upcoming titles pretty directly. Either way, it has everything that makes the base game great as well as some insanely frustrating arcade sections.\n\nSupport Yai Gameworks and download this pack even if you already own the anniversary remake.","timestamp_created":1589366577,"timestamp_updated":1589366577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49qrohvICdP63hwI="}
