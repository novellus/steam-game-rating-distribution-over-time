Megalith had the big guns behind them being made from developers with AAA experience... launched their game, patched it a couple of times and continue to ignore the community. DSH has done nothing but get better.\n-Bots with varying difficulties\n-Crossplay with flat screen, pcvr and quest\n-Leaderboards\n-Achievement system\n-Store to buy new guns/skins with the credits you earn in game\n-One of the few games that you can run at 144hz, max settings on index no problems\n-New map with multiple lanes\n-New Heroes added that play with some of the fun things that VR brings to the table and different play styles.\n-And after following this game for over a year, a crazy passion from the dev to take all the feedback they can from the community and continue to make DSH better.\n\n*v1.0 review*\nGreat foundation to work with.\nLove to play a Moba in VR.\nMultiple classes to pick (and he plans to add more!)\nLots of ways to approach a battle.\nDev listens to feedback and the game is only getting better.\nReally requires communication like a real Moba should\nOculus support is getting better (snap turn added on joystick).\nKeep the udpates coming!","timestamp_created":1546796210,"timestamp_updated":1594252911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mZy4mPMCdMbXtwE="}
