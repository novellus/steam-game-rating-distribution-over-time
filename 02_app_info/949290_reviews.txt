It's made for a very narrow spectrum of gamers though, you'll probably know if it's for you by just looking at the screenshots and reading the description, but I encourage everyone who is even a little intrigued or who enjoys relaxing sandbox style games to give this game a shot. Everything you see and read about it is what you'll get when you buy this game. Nothing more, nothing less. If you bought this game and don't like it, it's because you didn't pay attention or had unfounded and unrealistic expectations.\n\nI'll briefly summarize the features:\n[list]\n[*]You run a shop (duh). There are dozens of products you can buy, craft, grow and sell. I've unlocked ~ 60 products while only focusing on two \"specializations\" (more on that in a bit), but I know there are at least a few more I'm close to unlocking in my chosen areas alone.\n[*]You may farm, albeit in a simplified manner. There are many crops you can grow which can be sold as they are in a sort of Farmers market or used in cooking to expand what you sell (or you can choose to only sell the food you make as well, nothing wrong with that).\n[*]There are half a dozen or so other \"Crafting Stations\" used in Cooking, Farming, Smithing/Forging, Alchemy, and Tailoring you can use to specialize your shop, or you can ignore crafting altogether and just \"buy low, sell high,\" serving as the middle man.\n[*]You can build and expand your shop in a surprisingly large number of ways for virtually endless variation. You can have a large, open facility filled with aisles of cabinets/shelves like modern supermarkets or cozy, smaller rooms with wooden tables separated by archways, doors, and windows. You can have shelves lined with goods hanging on the walls or you can hang paintings/wall art for more aesthetic appeal. You can even build what basically amounts to an outdoor market, with stalls and carts and fences replacing cabinets, tables and walls.\n[*]You may choose to specialize in a certain category (Farmer, Cook, Tailor, Alchemist, etc), which the shoppers will, after a few days, adapt to and only those shoppers interested in your chosen specialty will shop at your store. If you would prefer being a general goods store you may specialize in two, three or ALL of the categories, though keeping that variety on hand ready to sell may prove challenging.\n[*]There are different seasons and events in the game that affect pricing of goods and number of shoppers\n[*]Finally, the basic gameplay loop goes like this: Buy/craft goods > Organize your shop (shelves, tables, cabinet locations, decor) > display your merchandise how you see fit > open the shop for the day >  monitor inventory levels throughout the day and restock when necessary > respond to customers when they overlook a product they're looking for/need something you don't have displayed > close, prepare for the next day, expand your shop and repeat\n[/list]\n\nNow a little more on specializations. \n\nMy first shop went like this: I bought a bunch of random goods to sell to people, not knowing exactly what I wanted to do or even what I could do yet. I set up tables, shelves, etc around the small room and sold to everyone whatever I could get my hands on at a good price. This is where specializing (or not) can help (or bite you in the backside)... \n\nWhen you display a large variety of goods, customers expect that variety every time they shop there. When you lack something a shopper desires, they go to your desk and request that good. If you wish, you may \"special order\" it right then and there and a merchant will bring it to you, but you'll make very little profit on these types of sales. If they leave without the good, they are dissatisfied by their experience. I faced this for some time before I decided to become a grocer. I purchased fruit and vegetables in bulk, stopped buying potions, smith supplies, clothes and firewood and began telling people no when they wished to order things I no longer wished to carry. They only asked about those types of goods for another day or two after I stopped selling them. They learn quickly what you carry and what you do not (you don't go to the hardware store to buy milk and bread, do you?) and I stopped getting orders for things I stopped carrying. Customers ONLY come in this shop to purchase my produce. By the end of the season I was growing my own crops and my customer base was satisfied.\n\nI decided to expand a little bit and began using the excess produce in preparing meals for customers. I lined cabinets and shelves with potatoes, cauliflower, asparagus, apples, etc., for customers to buy but started serving meals in a separate area, similar to a grocery store you visit today. Customers began to purchase these prepared meals in addition to the produce and raw materials. I carved out a satisfying niche, a sort of grocery store/farmer's market where customers may buy prepared meals if they wish, just the meat, fruit and vegetables used in cooking, or both.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of confusion and questions about the specialization system, so I hope this all clears it up/helps you understand. You may specialize if you wish, into as many categories as you wish, and the game behaves incredibly intuitively. In my example, if I suddenly stopped selling prepared foods, customer will still ask me to sell them prepared food for a day or two but will eventually stop. If I started selling clothes, customers may not buy many articles of clothing for the first day, but will begin to do so as my shop becomes \"known\" for it.\n\nI've rambled a bit more than I planned to, suffice it to say, this is a really neat, unique game I encourage you to try if you enjoy this type of game. You probably know if you're in that group. If you are intrigued by it but aren't completely sure you'd like this type of game because you've never played many simulation games or \"open-ended\" games without a specific, linear story or goal, I encourage you to try it, but don't expect anything it doesn't advertise. There is no action, there is no adventure mode, there is no combat, you don't fight monsters, there is no danger (except bankruptcy lol). You're literally running a shop.\n\nIf this sounds boring and you don't see the point, that's fine, you aren't the target audience lol.","timestamp_created":1609711307,"timestamp_updated":1609711419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ459+R5fYCeOyawAI="}
