Given how (literally) spotty early gauge lights are, this is actually a pretty functional addition.\n+ Lots of extra stock with original models, supporting dynamic loaded/unloaded states.\n+ Probably the most attention a caboose has received in any release for this game — a unique model with six liveries and four passenger view positions (cupola left & right; desk; bed). It's only missing the option of crewed versions.\n+ They went overboard with the customisable details on this (control binds in manual). It's just a shame these variations don't appear automatically at random or linked to loco number. It's probably possible to set them on AI trains through scenario scripting, but, all the same, these variations will only rarely be seen.\n\nNotes on caboose usage:\n• Table of liveries observed in use over the years: https://utahrails.net/drgw/rg-caboose-paint-01400-01439.php\n• № 01400 appears to have been the sole example in the black-with-orange-roof livery, and operated out of Roper on locals.","timestamp_created":1609103060,"timestamp_updated":1609622630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw54W/4vYCdcXwvQI="}
