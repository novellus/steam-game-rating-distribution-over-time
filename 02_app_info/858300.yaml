    review: So I have been playing Dreadnought on PS4 since closed beta. I've seen
      the changes and been there through the ups and downs. The game was great, though
      it is and was a grind. There's just something about flying a battleship-cruiser
      like spaceship into battle! It is still in development since launching on steam,
      and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. I love the music and sounds
      of the game.
