It's a minimalist reinvention of the classic Rolling Thunder, one of my favourite arcade games.\nThat's why I'm pleased to be able to help its creator financially by buying the paid version.\nKeep it up, because I think you have a lot of future as a game designer.\n","timestamp_created":1573037341,"timestamp_updated":1573037341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lJ+VoO4Cfvj91wE="}
