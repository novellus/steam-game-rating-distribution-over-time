As soft as that therapy pillow your chiropractor told you to buy for night-time neck pain...fluffier than that favorite, 10 year old heavy blanket you sleep under every winter season...about on par with that baby duck Aunt Gertrude bought you when you were 3.  Yeah, you get the picture.  Though Follia - Dear Father has gotten a lot of knocks for being an Outlast clone, I'm going to say that other than the first act I really didn't get that vibe much at all.  No sir, instead this at times oddly fun, cliche-ridden attempted scarefest is more just generally a pastiche of every horror game ever made rather than content to mime one particular title.  \n\nYou star as near silent hero Marcus Pitt and one day while sleeping in front of your computer after a big boy Miller Lite bender, you wake up conveniently to find an email alerting of trouble afoot at the Frederick Fidelity University.  With a flick of your trusty bong-lighting torch you get a call from your useless friend Ryan and instead of suggesting to call the authorities, he gives Marcus the brilliant idea that they should investigate the problem on their own.  Your able and trusty sidekick Ryan parks the car and leaves you to your own devices to investigate a literal campus of terror.  \n\nLet's face it, not all video game plots are stellar but if you get my gist, Follia has one of the most disposable tales told of all time on display.  It's rendered even more archaic by a small list of notes and documents that neither have the content let alone the writing to make them even worth collecting.  Twisted labs and mad experiments are the order of the day in the university's science wing and that's about all you need to know without me ruining the \"finer\" elements.  \n\nOriginality is not a strong suit in the RE lifted door/gate opening animations, the aforementioned story, the Outlast heavy quiet \"sneak into the building\" intro, etc.  You're going to be hitting switches, running from monsters, recharging a flashlight with batteries, finding keys, the works...  There should be nothing to enjoy at all in Follia but on some odd level the core parts of the gameplay and the clashes with a variety of different monster types pushed me to get to the next area and see what troubles there were to solve.  In terms of putting up with the small but consistently varied roster of threats, that's where Follia got enough juice to sustain one playthrough.  I wish I would have started the game on hardcore as it's not overly challenging (some of the one kill deaths are absolutely cheap yet don't impede progress enough to be frustrating) though that's not a bottle of spilled milk I'm about to cry over.   \n\nMarcus can run, push objects, crouch, crawl and hide.  There's also a very tiny amount of weapons to find that you can slash and defend with that does make tangling with the hideous college dropouts a bit more exciting than \"find the next locker and wait for the school bully to pass.\"  Follia actually allows for touches of aggressive gameplay that allow you to lure monsters close, slash/block them to stun their ugly mugs and then try to get to your next mundane objective.  It's loose at best but there is a more rhythmic flow to the experience than a lot of indie horror titles can muster up, so props need to be given there.  \n\nEven the flashlight battery system puts the pressure on you to actually search your surroundings if you want a better light source; I personally actually enjoyed the limited ambiance of the lighter as it added a darker atmosphere to exploration and what seemed like a better chance at keeping the monsters from noticing Marcus' lumbering behind.  A fleet-footed fellow he's not and although movement controls work well-enough as expected for a horror game, prepare for a couple of harried E/use object clicks when you're in a hurry.  Heck, even if you're not pressed for time the hitboxes for using are terribly...uh...hit or miss.  \n\nAs far as presentation goes I enjoyed the monsters (I think a few are Unity assets albeit they are well-implemented for each respective location) and the lighting FX.  The environments are fairly run of the mill and are unfortunately prone to screen tearing on certain settings.  I also fell out of the map twice in the one late game boss fight which didn't do much to improve my opinion of Follia's negative points.  On the soundscale, the game fares much better with creepy wails for the monsters, adequate voice acting for what little there is and solid environmental twinges that keep you tense even when you are dredging the downtime between threats.  \n\nMy caveat for this game is that there is no question whatsoever that I'm recommending it for SALE PRICE, only.  It could use a ton of polish, the developers have flown the chicken coop and cliches abound in every corner.  The weird thing is that Follia is a game that actually finds a way to turn those cliches into a constantly invigorating rhythm that gave me a kick in the pants to want to find the next area...and never once did I have to hide in a locker or even hide that much in the grand scheme of things.  \n\nTake all of this for what you will.  If I was getting near the bottom of my exhaustible horror titles and needed a new one for a sale price, there's certainly quite a few indies that I would pick Follia over.  There are also even more games that I would pick over Follia.  It's a better than it should be 6/10 in my book.","timestamp_created":1609290592,"timestamp_updated":1609290592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8LXM2PYCeJ/QvgI="}
