This is a bait & switch gimmick.  After I purchased this game / app, the developers sent out a notice saying they are switching to a monthly subscription...even for existing customers.  They are only offering six (6) months of this game's premium version, and then we get the shaft with the free version!  I smell rip-off indeed....should be criminal if it is not already. \n\nDevelopers took my money on terms of paid free and clear full version, and now they change their terms and want me to keep paying monthly.  Wow....you really need to have a lot of gall to pull this B.S.  I'm forced to have to file a complaint now with the BBB just to get started.","timestamp_created":1597950818,"timestamp_updated":1597950920,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1598473079,"developer_response":"Hi there, Thank you for your feedback and we hope you accept our sincere apologies.\nI want to use this opportunity to let you know why we made this decision and what steps we have taken to be fair with those who have paid.\n\nJoining the Steam store as a VR company, especially one that is more of a serious game painted a very unclear picture for us. We had very little knowledge on how this would pick up and therefore decided to like all other markets kick it off with a paid model (which also peaks the interest of the marketplace we are in to possibly feature us). \n\nUnfortunately we realized that it was not meeting our expectations and we internally decided to make the application free as we grew our library of games to the point where a freemium model made sense.\n\nTo be fair with everyone who paid we offer two options: (1) Immediately refund them and allow them to keep the game (2) not refund them but offer them 6 months of subscription once the freemium model kicks in which is a price value of much more than what they paid initially.\n\nWe had decoded to go free a lot sooner (first few days) but unfortunately Steam does not allow us to make changes in the first 30 days.\n\nThis being said we would be more than happy to refund you and hope you continue to be one of the trail blazers in playing Enhance VR and helping us make this the most powerful brain training application out there.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with us through email: support@virtuleap.com and we can discuss further if needed.\n\nHopefully this post can help you and others who felt betrayed with our decision understand that this was not at all our intention and we look forward to rectifying the problem. \n\nThanks again."}],"cursor":"AoJw1IDThvQCcJjYnAI="}
