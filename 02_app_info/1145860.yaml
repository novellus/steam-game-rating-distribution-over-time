    review: "1/10 \n Brilliant images, simple graphics, basic concept, try not to\
      \ get found by the monster.\n\nIssue, the cone of vision is so broken the monster\
      \ instantly always gets you and you can only get by the beginning of the monster\
      \ if he glitches through the wall to the other side. \n\nOnce you get to the\
      \ next part, he always gets you. There's no point hiding behind anything as\
      \ he will get you.\n\nIf you watch my review below you will see this and I did\
      \ state, it has only recently been released but I've seen more complex indie\
      \ games working perfectly. I will play this game again within the next two weeks\
      \ if I see they have fixed these issues but if not, I won't change my review.\n\
      \nI don't want to see a good game being given a negative review all be wise\
      \ of negligence.\n\nHere's my review: \nhttps://youtu.be/pEQr_JJ8N70\n\nHere's\
      \ my second review that I did the next week: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/LmSYUYnd8b8"
