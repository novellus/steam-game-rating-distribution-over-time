It's a top-down hack&slash with bullet hell elements where you have a little droid that auto-aims (kinda like Nier). Unfortunately, there are no upgrades or RPG elements, the goal is just to finish the stage with what you have. Your character has a one-button combo, dash,  stamina for droid, and occasional bomb charges that clear the screen. At the time of this review, I only finished 2 stages, but I think there are only 3 in total, not including boss fights. Even though the game is challenging, I think the difficulty is fair because enemies have nice attack indicators. So far the boss fights have been very fun, each with multiple stages. The only criticism I have is in regards to music, the soundtrack is recycled on some of the stages, and so are most of the enemies, with a few new additions as you progress. I wish the dev would have added more mechanics to it, but for what it is, the price is fair.\n\nAlso... Is that Yellow Flash?....
