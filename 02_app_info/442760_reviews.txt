It's also a roguelike but it's just way too easy to die from one tiny mistake and have to start all over.  The attack mechanics aren't very satisfying since you can't really aim where you shoot.  \n\nCool graphics and atmosphere but it didn't hold my interest.  Music is nice.","timestamp_created":1469603931,"timestamp_updated":1469603931,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562841534614562988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t4zOldYCcPfTXQ=="}
