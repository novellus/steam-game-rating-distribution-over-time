Main Character has a power that leads people to call her the Magic Mirror. She shows you your true self. However, it seems to at best, give her a headache, at worse, put her in a coma for three days so... she's not interested in using it.\n\nThere is a first layer of love interests. If you send them all packing, which you can't until  your second play through, then you get to the second level of love interests.  Then do one of those and you get the Secret Love interest. Music was good, I especially liked the song that played during the epilogue when you got a good ending. The art was pretty,  but the men were anime-boy slender, sometimes that worked, but the outfits for the were-animals seemed a bit off. \n\nLeo- He actually needed your magic powers for a good reason. it was standard fluff, doesn't mean I didn't like it. Frankly, the writer REALLY NAILED what a crush feels like. As a woman who has intensely crushed many a time, the writer was really speaking my language. I also prefer the endings where you don't ditch your friend Sol. \nBlanq- Doesn't need your magic powers at all. I liked his good ending, but I liked the \"bad\" polyamorous ending even more because I'm poly and I love seeing that in media.\nSol- I guess Sol  never needs your powers \nWynn- He needed your powers for a good reason too. I kinda hate when the love interests actually need the MC, it makes me feel guilty for not picking them to help them. He's a sort of tsundere.\n\nSho is a jerk that really doesn't redeem himself.  I will say right here that I'm like 99% heterosexual before stating the following about the female love interests. Ronah is a non consensual grabby kissy brat. maybe she needs your powers for a good cause but I'm not finding out because I hate non consent. Cara was the most boring route I tried. I did not bother with Thyria as being too loud and angry. Peony-She's a weirdy and I was just done by this point, so I didn't do her route either. \n\n\nFlaws: Since I just read most of all this in the same 5 hours, the writer definitely lost track of whether MC liked tea, hated tea with a passion, hated ALL bitter things, but liked coffee. it was such a weird detail to not keep up with.\n\nAdditionally, I wish there had been friendship paths. If I could have helped Queen Ronah with her Kingdom while NOT kissing her, I probably would have. \n\nAlso, I am left with a lot of lore questions: What is a mermaid contract? how does a mermaid get one, then continue getting them? why does it give them legs, or do they get to specify what they get? what are they giving in return? Are there all types of were creatures? how did the same woman give birth to a were dragon AND a were wolf? Is this a common happening, does the mom just have to be human and bang a random magical animal? or did the fathers need to already be were creatures? how does this work? Random mentions of children just \"getting magic\"... is this totally random? somewhat genetic? one got magic at 8, the other at like 12- is it a puberty thing? like, tell me  *grump face*\n\nanyway, I enjoyed my time and I recommend it. It is not plot or lore heavy.","timestamp_created":1608765305,"timestamp_updated":1608765305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4is74yPYCcr3OvAI="}
