Ninja Reflex is a game for kids big and small and it knows it, packing in enough pseudo-confucian nonsense from your sensei to give you that authentic martial-arts movie feel, even throwing in a slightly bizarre meditation mode for those times when you need to get your Chi back on track after a frustrating run of failures. From the moment you start a game, picking your name from a random duo of martial arts clichés – with more unlocked as you play – you’re right there in the Ninja zone.\n\nHowever, as is so often the case, it’s one that’s let down by a worrying lack of variety and an even more worrying lack of content. When it all comes down to it you are only getting six basic disciplines and a handful of variations on each, and it won’t be long before you’re pushing your way through the belts.\n\nAll in all, it’s hard to see you getting your money’s worth once the initial novelty has worn off. That’s a huge shame, because for the first couple of hours Ninja Reflex really does feel like one of the most entertaining games concepts.","timestamp_created":1350672433,"timestamp_updated":1597579120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2NnI+/MCdv/UBQ=="}
