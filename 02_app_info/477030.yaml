    review: "[b] \u201CWilma? A prodigy? Lol no.\u201D Otto, Wilma perfectly played\
      \ violin her first time holding one. I think she is. [/b]\n\nOh, what a ride\
      \ we had. Starting as a young violinist named Wilma struggling to make her debut\
      \ piece; then as an up-and-coming painter named Franz who can see people\u2019\
      s layers, but not his own; and lastly as Emma, a female mathematician who disguised\
      \ herself as a man so she could get help on her theory. In the last Lion\u2019\
      s Song Episode, Closure, we actually join in on the people who got on a train\
      \ at the beginning of each episode. It turns out, each of them were involved\
      \ with Wilma/Franz/Emma in some degree, with Bert hearing it all (and possibly\
      \ writing it down?).\n\nFrom episode 1, Wilma\u2019s brother, Otto, tells the\
      \ story of her sister. Not what happened after her concert, though he will play\
      \ her piece, but before she left for Vienna. You\u2019ll get to see when she\
      \ was discovered, when she first started playing (and how gifted she was from\
      \ the start), and how she always took inspiration from the world around her.\
      \ Next, you\u2019ll join Paul from episode 2. Paul is a forger and while he\
      \ didn\u2019t necessarily have contact with Franz, Franz was his favorite artist\
      \ to copy. Lastly, you\u2019ll see what happened after Emma\u2019s showdown\
      \ with Zahler from Theodor\u2019s perspective. Being one of Emma\u2019s students,\
      \ Theodor retells Emma\u2019s relationship with some of the students, how the\
      \ other Radius members are doing, and Emma\u2019s future plans to his companions.\
      \ Once all three of them finish, it\u2019s revealed that they enlisted (or drafted)\
      \ to fight in World War 1. With Bert, this episode\u2019s protagonist who was\
      \ writing all this down, being a lieutenant who will hopefully publish their,\
      \ and other\u2019s, stories someday.\n\nClosure holds most of what your decisions\
      \ amounted to as well. You get to see how Franz\u2019s painting turned out and\
      \ what happened depending on if you humiliated Zahler or not, with the rest\
      \ showing up in the closing scenes (like Wilma\u2019s future if she wanted to\
      \ be with Arthur or go back home and how successful her song was). The closing\
      \ scenes not only showed what happened to the three main protagonists, but to\
      \ the ones that were connected to them. Sadly, we don\u2019t get any word on\
      \ how Bert turned out.\n\nThis is the perfect time to talk about The Lion\u2019\
      s Song\u2019s Connections, which I believe wasn\u2019t available till this episode\
      \ came out. Each episode has their own art gallery-esque room that displays\
      \ the connection other episodes had with it. Like the painting Franz painted\
      \ at the end of episode 2 will be in episode 4\u2019s gallery. This does mean\
      \ if you\u2019re intending to get all the achievements, you\u2019ll have to\
      \ replay The Lion\u2019s Song a lot. Hopefully you haven\u2019t been replaying\
      \ each episode to get the achievements before continuing on. While you replay\
      \ from a decision, if you messed up anywhere, you\u2019ll have to restart again.\
      \ Not to mention that some connections require you to restart the chapter again\
      \ anyway (like gaining Grete\u2019s affections).\n\nHowever, this messes up\
      \ the timeline for episode 1. Even though Wilma\u2019s song is played at the\
      \ beginning of episode 2 and she makes an appearance in episode 3 (as well as\
      \ Leos showing up if you encouraged him to call Nikol), the connections imply\
      \ that it took place after. Wilma can find Franz\u2019s sketch of her if you\
      \ decided to sell it, Emma\u2019s name will be in the Elements of Change book,\
      \ and a letter will change if you won Grete\u2019s affection as Franz or not.\
      \ I get the intention, but it doesn\u2019t work out since Wilma wrote her song\
      \ first.\n\nWhile Closure doesn\u2019t necessarily give us closure for each\
      \ character we met, it did show us a perspective outside of the three protagonists\
      \ and how they touched the world around them. Not to mention that we finally\
      \ get to see when The Lion\u2019s Song took place in a surprising reveal. Well,\
      \ unless you were curious if Klimt from episode 2 was real (fun fact, the painting\
      \ he\u2019ll paint with the special paint seems to be the portrait of Adele\
      \ Bloch-Buer). I do wish we got some more episodes for The Lion\u2019s Song,\
      \ but what we have is great. If Mi\u2019pu\u2019mi Games decides to bring us\
      \ another game, I will certainly be ready to play it in a heartbeat.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitch/recommended/437160]\
