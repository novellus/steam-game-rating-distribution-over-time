Every faction generally gets some sort of boost from a Dust Eclipse as well.\n-It also adds Lava Terrain, foodless terrain that gives high science, dust, and industry - lava rivers add to industry very much. It's basically a non starter for every race, though, unless....\n-You're the Kapaku, the new faction able to get food from lava tiles, terraform other land into lava tiles, make very cheap upkeep golems, and make Golem Camps across the map that serve as unconnected districts, able to farm another 6 tiles when other civs can't make a second city in the region. They also get the best bonuses from Dust Eclipses.\n-The Kapaku are a very strong faction, both offensively (their units are powerful, cheap, regenerate, and get terrain based bonuses, even off lava.) and defensively. (lava terrain deals hostile attrition damage to enemies, unless you're the Kapaku.) their story quests are also incredibly easy, and they're the best poised to take advantage of Dust Eclipses and confluxes, which give them a bigger bonus than anyone in the game.\n-You cannot un-terraform lava terrain. This means any game where the Kapaku exist will slowly be taken over into Lava, with no recourse for other civilizations. This seems like a big miss, and unfun lategame for non-Kapaku factions.\n\nOverall - while well produced, and fun if you're the Kapaku themselves, the balance for this expansion feels off in almost every way. I tend to play with the expansion disabled, which is a shame, because I like dust eclipses, but  Ireally dislike Lava terrain and the Kapaku when handled by an AI. The addition of un-lava terraforming should have been an easy counter for sanity, but wasn't put in.\n\nI'm giving the DLC a negative rating not because I think it's a poor DLC per se, but because I think it's a poor addition to the overall game experience - unless you're playing as the Kapaku themselves, where you have an absolutely wonderful time with everything. It's very lopsided.","timestamp_created":1596335974,"timestamp_updated":1596335974,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635333120822906494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw57zC1vMCdL3ymAI="}
