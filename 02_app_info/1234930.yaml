    review: 'There was a very loud noise that hurt my ears and then I died over and
      over. The screen was completely black and the game told me to run but it was
      no use. I STILL DIED.


      I was sad because this was the last game my dying father bought for me and it''s
      an insult to his memory. My ancestors have abandoned me from heaven and left
      me to fend for myself in this cruel cruel world.


      Thanks game developer, 10/10 would play again'
