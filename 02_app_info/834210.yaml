    developer_response: 'Good day dear customer


      We are very sorry that you do not like our product.

      The timer was wanted. You can always buy new time with 2000 credits.

      Thus, the game would never be stopped. We take your criticism to heart and will
      work on our current product and later products. For you to make more interesting
      and understandable.


      We are now working on a version WITHOUT the annoying timer.


      We look forward to welcoming you again as a customer.'

    review: 'I like to support Clicker or Idle game developers. I bought game + DLC
      and regret this after 10 minutes...

      1. This game is so simple that can be made in Unity in less than 1 day.

      2. There is no tactic, strategy - nothing in this game. You can just buy 3 idle
      source of income and... nothing more. There is no progress, no new planets -
      nothing

      3. Game is totaly empty. You can click on 4 diffrent things and do nothing more

      4. GAME RESET YOUR PROGRESS RANDOMLY! I played 10 minutes and clicked 3000 times.
      I was kicked out from game, when I started it again I needed to start from zero.
      Same happen when you buy DLC and choose diffrent planet (mirrored + diffrent
      color = 2 USD payment... really?)


      Summary: It is the worst clicker game i ever saw. I can not believe that want
      5USD from me (in Poland) for this crap which can be made in few hours with very
      basic Unity knowledge. The worst is that there is no progress system and even
      your ingame "gold" is reseted without reason.


      Just avoid this game - even the worst free to play clicker game is better than
      this scam.'
