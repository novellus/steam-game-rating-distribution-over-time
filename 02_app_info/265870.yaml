    review: ' The story is  really interesting and the game play is also good. I might
      have beaten sooner if I didn''t fight every enemy which made me able to fight
      the few bosses fight in the game. I only had one game over at the last boss
      fight but this was due to my own fault. The only things I didn''t like the game
      is that up until the last boss fight you don''t get a skill that will attack
      all of the enemies. No healing skills that will everyone in your party but everyone
      have their own healing skill.  It also left questions unanswer and left is at
      a huge cliffhanger. This would not be a problem if the sequels were brought
      to STEAM.  If fine a place I trust to get the sequels I''ll post it here.'
