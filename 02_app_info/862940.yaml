    review: I will say that if you can get these in the bundle and on deep discount,
      they're worth checking out, but this second part is weaker than the already
      short first. You basically spend 10 minutes shooting at 1 demon and I honestly
      thought I was doing something wrong because it took so long for anything to
      happen. Mr Staypuft eventually shows up which is awesome, but fighting him is
      pretty nondescript and uninteresting, and the controls reference is also using
      the Playstation Move controller so you can't actually look at the real controls.
      Ghostbusters does deserve a proper VR game, and this is kind of a neat glimpse,
      but oculd have been better.
