The original goal of MTR was to make money, but that is no longer the case.  My sister is having a child soon who will need three open-heart surgeries by the age of three\/four.  I want to use the sales from MTR to cover the costs of these surgeries, as this could be well into a million dollars, and neither they or I have that kind of money.  100% of the proceeds from the game's sales is currently set to go to a fund just for them to cover these medical expenses.  So essentially, by buying this game, you are A) Showing support to a young family and a child who will be struggling for his life and B) Getting a pretty awesome game with about five-six hours of content if you are really good.
