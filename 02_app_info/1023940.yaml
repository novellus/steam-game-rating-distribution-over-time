    about_the_game: 'VR-CPR is a<strong> virtual reality simulation</strong> of emergency
      situations, designed to be a training tool for teaching the procedure of <strong>cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR)</strong>. The system offers <strong>three photo-realistic
      scenarios </strong>in which the user is called to help a victim of cardiac arrest,
      receiving <strong>real-time feedback </strong>of the chest compression performance.
      <br><br>At the beginning of each demo you will be able to select among three
      different scenarios: <strong>hospital, out-of-hospital and paediatric</strong>.
      Each scenario differs for victim and AED availability, requiring the user to
      perform different protocols. Before starting, it is possible to customize some
      aspects, such as the AED arrival time, how many chest compression cycles to
      perform, which cycles should be shockable or not-shockable, and the AED that
      you should use. Our partnership with some of the most important AED producers
      allowed us to reproduce the real life units, with the same audio and video hints
      the user would get during a real emergency.<br><br>Before starting the experience,
      it is possible to calibrate the scenario in order to match the virtual victim
      chest with a compression device or surface. In this way, you can perform CPR
      on an object of your choice, preferably a manikin, getting real time accurate
      feedback on the depth and the rate of the compressions. <br><br>Each scenario
      shows a patient collapsing after a cardiac arrest. You will be guided through
      the specific <strong>BLSD protocol </strong>each scenario features: assessing
      consciousness, checking for breathing, calling for help, performing CPR and
      AED use. Controllers are used to track the chest compressions in the dedicated
      phase, and provide instant feedback that will help you to adjust and improve
      your performance. <br><br>Our project does not replace the current medical tools
      used during training; it complements them with visual feedback, real-time feedback
      and an additional level of immersion.<h2 class="bb_tag">Credits</h2><br>Project:
