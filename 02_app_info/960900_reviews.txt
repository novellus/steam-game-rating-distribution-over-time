You can only use keyboard (and controller)! This is deal-breaking!\n- No minimap (is extra annoying due to the bad controls on PC)\n- Lack of visual cues (e.g. it is hard to see if soldiers are enemies or allies)\n\nI am probably not gonna play this game again, but I will still recommend it since I want to support the RTS genre and indie studios","timestamp_created":1600771587,"timestamp_updated":1600771587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u//a2vQCdaGrowI="}
