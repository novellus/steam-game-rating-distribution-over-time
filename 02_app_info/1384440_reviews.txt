There's no sound effects or music, just some barely animated stock library anime sprites supposed to represent your co-workers. Horribly written dialogue with poor grammar and multiple spelling mistakes every sentence, very few branching paths or dialogue possibilities. Did I mention it's half an hour long?\n\nI played it because I liked the premise having worked in a call centre before and love visual novels, but with so little \"game\" here I don't think it's worth even a fraction of what the dev is charging. Frankly I've played free visual novels which have better production values and effort put in than this.\n\nDon't waste your time or money. The only good thing about The Call Centre is that it's so short that it qualifies for an automatic refund.","timestamp_created":1598719117,"timestamp_updated":1598952903,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552238762378692627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4laLBpPQCdqbHngI="}
