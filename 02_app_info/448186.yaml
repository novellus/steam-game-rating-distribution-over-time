    about_the_game: "Designed as a successor to the LNWR\u2019s extensive 0-8-0 fleet,\
      \ which had lineage dating back to the 1890s, the G2 Class surfaced in the 1920s\
      \ and, thanks to its developments, was able to dominate the LNWR and LMS network\
      \ right through to the end of steam. To rekindle the fire of a bygone era, the\
      \ LNWR G2 comes to authentic life within Train Simulator, ready for contemporary\
      \ mixed-traffic service courtesy of Partner Programme Developer MeshTools.<br><br>Building\
      \ upon the previous iteration of 0-8-0 locomotives became nothing short of a\
      \ habit for the LNWR, and early examples such as the A Class were consistently\
      \ rebuilt to incorporate new features. One particular class of locomotive, the\
      \ G2, was designed as a more capable 0-8-0 than the earlier G1, which in turn\
      \ was essentially a superheated D Class. Upgraded features such as a higher\
      \ boiler pressure, strengthened frames, large axles and axle boxes plus a redesigned\
      \ and strengthened direct acting joy valve gear were all present in the G2,\
      \ and the 60 locomotives which were produced were all entirely new builds.<br><br>While\
      \ the LNWR G2 Class comprised of an average-sized fleet, the overall number\
      \ of active 0-8-0s totalled up to 502 \u2013 the 4th largest fleet of the LMS\
      \ and 6th largest of British Railways. With numbers running high, the LNWR 0-8-0s\
      \ were a regular sight across the network, and the G2s, with their various advancements,\
      \ proved popular for nearly any duty. Freight, passenger, banking, shunting,\
      \ you name it and a G2 would often be at the helm.<br><br>As the now-merged\
      \ LMS began to further innovate in locomotive design, with Sir William Stanier\
      \ producing iconic designs such as the LMS Black 5, Jubilee and Princess Coronation\
      \ Classes, the LNWR 0-8-0s managed to stand their ground as a worthy piece of\
      \ the railway puzzle. Surprisingly, the G2 fleet became subject to a number\
      \ of Stanier-overseen upgrades, the net result being that no two G2s were ever\
      \ quite the same. <br><br>Having served since 1921, the G2s were starting to\
      \ age alongside even older LNWR 0-8-0s. It was decided that a further development\
      \ process would be undertaken, and the result was the LMS 7F. Also known as\
      \ the G3, nicknamed Austin 7, the LMS 7F followed on from the G2 and featured\
      \ a long travel Walschaerts valve gear and higher boiler pressure, and was intended\
      \ to allow the 0-8-0s to retire. The 7Fs were fantastic when they worked, however\
      \ they were very prone to failures. Inadequate axle boxes from Derby\u2019s\
      \ 4F spelled an early end for the expensive to run and rarely available 7F fleet,\
      \ the last of which was withdrawn in 1959.<br><br>Having outlived their \u2018\
      successors\u2019, the G2 locomotives lived on until 1964, with the last two\
      \ leaving service at the end of that year. Out of the 60 LNWR G2 locomotives,\
      \ which were known by many as the Super Ds, only one survived into preservation.\
      \ Today, 49395 lives in Shildon as part of the National Railway Museum\u2019\
      s collection.<br>The LNWR G2 Class for Train Simulator authentically recreates\
      \ the mixed-traffic icon in clean and weathered LNWR, LMS and BR liveries, complete\
      \ with contemporary freight rolling stock and a bonus LNER J94 and LNER J50\
      \ steam locomotives in weathered BR Black livery.<br><br>The locomotive is also\

    review: "Eines der wohl realistischsten Dampflok Addons, die man bekommen kann.\
      \ Wer eine wahre Herausforderung sucht und herausfinden will, ob man das Zeug\
      \ hat vor 70, 80 Jahren als Dampflokf\xFChrer h\xE4tte arbeiten k\xF6nnen, ist\
      \ hier richtig.\n\nDie Lok ist auf keinen Fall etwas f\xFCr eine gem\xFCtliche\
      \ Ausfahrt, das Befolgen der Anweisungen des Handbuches (und damit das Lesen\
      \ desselben) ist Pflicht - sonst ist die Fahrt schnell zu Ende. Hat man einmal\
      \ herausbekommen wie das BIest funktioniert, schleppt sie selbst schwere Z\xFC\
      ge ohne Probleme.\nDas Modell ist aussergew\xF6hnlich gut, sch\xF6n texturiert\
      \ und der Sound einer besten die es gibt f\xFCr mich.\nAbsolute Empfehlung f\xFC\
      r Leute, die bereit sind intensiv die Bedienung zu lernen und alte englsche\
      \ Dampfer lieben.\nZur Vereinfachung gibt es einen eigenen automatsichen Heizer,\
      \ der sich aber nur um das Feuer k\xFCmmert - die Injektoren muss man immer\
      \ noch selbst bedienen.\n\nF\xFCr Nachtfahrten gibt es einige Funktionen, die\
      \ ich im Handbuch nicht gefunden habe:\nQ um ein Streichholz zu z\xFCnden f\xFC\
      r enien Blick auf das Bremsmanometer, STRG + H f\xFCr die Beleuchtung der Wasserst\xE4\
      nde, STRG + P um ein Streichholz anzuz\xFCnden f\xFCr das Kesseldruckmanometer.\n\
      \nDie mitgelieferten Szenarien sind auch sehr sch\xF6n gestaltet, atmosph\xE4\
      risch und nicht einfach zu fahren. Negatives gibt es so gesehen nicht, es kann\
      \ ab und an halt etwas frustrierend sein, bis man die Bedienung sicher erlernt\
      \ hat."
