      <br />\r\nA retro styled 3D platformer that let's players come at challenges\
      \ from whatever angle you want. Ashley Dengra is a 9nth grade artist with a\

      \ />\r\nThis game repurposes a lot of assets from my previous work. I just wanted\
      \ to see if I could do it, and I am really happy with the result. Thought I\
      \ might also step out of my comfort zone and try to make something wacky for\
      \ a change. It's not a deep game, but I hope it's fun. I actually tried to ignore\
      \ my years in art school to come up with zany designs and level themes that\
      \ I feel a 9nth grader would think is cool (or at least, travel down memory\
      \ lane to the kinds of designs I thought were cool when I was a 9nth grader).\
      \ For maximum enjoyment, please take it at face value, thanks!<br />\r\nSayuri~<br\

      \ and OST!"
