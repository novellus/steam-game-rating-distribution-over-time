It has a nice map but that’s about it.  Little to no content, as a new character, everything kills you.  There is no Low/Med/High Engagements, so starting off is a bit tough, it lacks the flow of Conan Exiles.  There is one NPC Camp and it’s a sleep fest, can’t kill or capture anyone there.  There are no NPC camps to be found, no little XP/Level Dungeons, it’s feels like this was rushed into service and is incomplete, which is sad because it has potential.  The Storms are a joke and make most of the map unusable when in play.\n\nI hope Funcom is looking at this and is planning a major overhaul, because after a few hours in this game I am ready to head back to my Steam Library and find one of my other games to play, Hell Conan Exiles as old as it is, is still a lot more fun to play than this is.  \n\nSo in it's current state would I recommend it?  NO!\n\n**Side Note**  \nYou will see 0 hours played, it because this review was done on my admin PC, if you check my profile you will see I have 2251.4 hours playing Conan.  Which is why I am sad at this current state of this update.","timestamp_created":1609771938,"timestamp_updated":1609772207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4udH55vYCdMK0wAI="}
