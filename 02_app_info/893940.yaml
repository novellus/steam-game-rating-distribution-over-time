      /><br><br>SUPER GMA is a 2D retro style fighting game where classic and modern
      gamers duke it out in a 8-bit pixel smashing and clashing adventure.<br><br>The
      game features an new energy system that allows you to regain more energy the
      more you fight. Even when your on the ropes and have the last piece of energy
      left, all you have to do to stay in the game is to keep fighting.<br><br>Take
      on a journey that pits you against the fiercest warriors across the nation.
      Don't even think for one second this will be easy. If you're really that good
      as you claim, take on your friends and rivals in the local multiplayer mode
      to earn your rightful ranking.<br><br>There's a world where your skills, techniques,
      and wits are out to the test against any challenger or rival you encounter.
      A world where 8 combatants are on a quest to emerge as the true GMA champion
      and uncover their true destinies. A world where the smallest piece of strength
      you possess can help you against all odds. However, that world is SUPER GMA

    review: "So. I adore indie games. By far my favorite genre. And while I can get\
      \ into some of the more main stream titles out there, there's nothing quite\
      \ like playing a game that a small group of people, if not just one person,\
      \ pours their heart into. \n\nSuper GMA is an 8-bit fighting game with 8 characters\
      \ to choose from. And that could have been all that was put into it, but it\
      \ isn't. Each character gets their own unique backstory in the campaign and\
      \ once you beat it, you get to see the resolve to their story. Everything that\
      \ you see and hear during the game was done by one person and that is where\
      \ this game gets it's charm. Great music, with an interesting twist on fighting\
      \ games where once you hit the enemy, you gain a bit of health back. Nice fair\
      \ fighting. I have yet to play the local multiplayer but I look forward to doing\
      \ so.\nThe punching sound effects are also very satisfying.\n\nA recent update\
      \ went into the game making it a nice and challenging arcade mode. It's legitimately\
      \ very enjoyable when you get a KO. I plan to beat the mode with every character.\
      \ A nice touch is the ability to add your name next to your high score at the\
      \ end.\n\nAll of this being made by one person makes me very excited to see\
      \ what they come up with for games in the future."
