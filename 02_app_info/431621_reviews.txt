Going over all the full 116 pages was kinda cool as you get insight on the characters and the development of the game. Also that Daki kinda hott...................................... Uhh you can also change the music while viewing.\n\nPortrait viewer was kinda fun to mess around with but there's nothing really to do once you go through it all.\n\nYou get cut content and more stuff to do overall. New boss rush type beat modes and unused levels with the addition of a boss. \n\nSolid artbook and exceeded my expectations. Recommend to those that want to support this game, it's devs, and just like the art and visuals.","timestamp_created":1610003895,"timestamp_updated":1610004133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yK7u7fYCfv+awQI="}
