    review: 'Sweet little idle game with about 10 hours worth of playtime (most of
      it is idling).


      You don''t have to do much in this game, your ship kills enemies without your
      help, you just buy upgrades and weapons for it. There is also some interraction
      with another character to progress the story. The story is simple, but nice
      and a little sad.


      Overall I recommend trying this game to relax for a day or two. It is kinda
      enjoyable to wait for Black Hole''s cooldown and see how quickly enemy ships
      disappear in it.'
