Think of this game as a top-down horde mode (a la Gears of War) with tower defence elements. \n\nThis far more polished version of that original game ended up being far more enjoyable than I expected - the gameplay is simple but fun, and pretty engaging. I still have to play with a controller, but mouse controls worked great. The tutorial was short and explained about everything you need to know. When you start playing for real, actually having to think up some strategy on the fly and learning how weapons work and which you prefer is a treat. Thoroughly enjoyed the survival mode. \n\nThis game will be supported for a while, I'll be sure to stay on the creator's ass about that (I want dat windowed mode). \n\nTL;DR Support mah dude so he can BUY HIS WOMAN A RING, CAN I GET AN AMEN!","timestamp_created":1543292522,"timestamp_updated":1543292522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568345367908477783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw4eHZqecCefHWswE="}
