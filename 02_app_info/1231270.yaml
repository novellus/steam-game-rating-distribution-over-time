      \ more if you don't want to have a bad time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is what\
      \ means to be a high security prison, but now is just a terrifying place that\
      \ you can't stand still if you don't want a horrifying death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe problem is due bad circumstances some of them are gone... Alright, most\
      \ of them. But your job are simply to watch the cameras and free the innocents\
      \ at the right time, you do not need to worry about them after they leave the\
      \ prison, just pay attention for the next one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn total have\
      \ four innocents, each one need to be freed after a specific time in a specific\
      \ order to make everything goes well. But the problem is the prisoner will chase\
      \ each one to death until they have reached freedom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour\
      \ job is to monitor the cameras at the control room, having six guards willing\
      \ to you send him to energy production or medicine collection, meaning that\
      \ you can't leave the prison, run out of energy or letting yourself insane.\
      \ But sending your guards to collect medicine close to him have some dangers,\
      \ maybe he can chase to kill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course if you know where\
      \ the prisoner is, will be more safer to your guards if you send they to where\
      \ the prisoner isn't. A map can be accessed to see the prison blocks and in\
      \ what cell will have medicine, but keep in mind that the prisoner knows where\
      \ all medicine is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCamera files eventually goes corrupted\
      \ if the prisoner gets close to them, you need to be sure that you are frequently\
      \ accessing a partially corrupted camera to gradually lower his corruption levels.\
      \ A warning will appear on the map monitor if a camera is high corrupted, but\
      \ be sure that you access them before it corrupts even more. If not, the camera\
      \ is eventually irreversibly corrupted and you will repair it yourself.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nOver time, camera corruption can be inevitable, and if one guard\
      \ dies... You have no guarantee that you will not see him after that.<br />\r\
