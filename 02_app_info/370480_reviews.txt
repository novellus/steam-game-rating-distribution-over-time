This comes from a casual gamer who usually plays other less intensive shooters.\n\nLiked: Immensely enjoyed the absorbing not only other pixels, but also placement and rotation of the said pixels. This gives an avenue for less skilled bullet haven gamers (like myself). Flashing pixels help pinpoint projectiles. The tutorials are very helpful such as stating pixels that add not only structure but also speed.\n\nDisliked: Trouble discerning between friends and foes. Maybe use a specific color or aura to know if/when the pixel to use will fire pixels at you. Otherwise, hoped co-op would be available at least after the easiest so shooters like myself can survive.\n\nOverall, the price (especially at discount) is worth it with the innovative tetris-like element to change the bullet haven genre for some casual gamers (similar to the game that uses light or darkness to absorb same color projectiles). Right now, I would recommend other games like THOTH or geometry wars if you are a more casual gamer.\n\nIf updated with either of the dislikes, I would update my review to recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1609483328,"timestamp_updated":1609483429,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yISs3vYCcISpvwI="}
