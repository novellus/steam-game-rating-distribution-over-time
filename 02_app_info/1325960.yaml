    review: 'In "Pandemic: The Virus Outbreak" you are tasked to eliminate a new found
      virus that has start to take over your country. You manage operations in your
      country those being, deciding to close borders, schools, stores, events and
      the industry, as well as having the option to force masks. Depending on whether
      you decide to close down certain operations or force masks it affects the infection,
      death and recovery rate. As well as economic growth, unemployment rate, your
      overall reputation as leader and how how effective the health system performs
      that including vaccine progress.  This also ties into how much money you make
      for your budget to pay for different investments those being, vaccine research,
      health system capacity, economy propaganda, virus propaganda and business aid
      packaging. Each of those investments costing $10 each. It''s somewhat hard to
      know what the right strategy is going in and what to spend your money on which
      is frustrating but I suppose you could argue it makes the game more challenging,
      but that is mainly the reason it makes the game less interesting to me.


      Overall its a basic simulation that may have a few hours of play time if you
      really enjoy these types of games. It''s only $1.99 and goes for cheaper occasionally.
      I would personally recommend it to people if you''re buying a ton of games on
      sale otherwise its not a must play.
