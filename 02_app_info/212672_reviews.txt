But I cant find it anywhere in the Ghost Recon Future Soldier menu.\nI have the original game Ghost Recon Future Soldier installed. Raven Strike is installed.\nHow can I play this? I tried everything.\nI give a thumbs up for GRFS because it is a great game but I want very much to play Raven Strike.
