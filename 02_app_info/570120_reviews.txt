However, it has now been updated. There is now a Kickback lit at the start of each ball, and the LAUNCH drop targets around a pop bumper no longer light locks, but instead the kickback. Plus, the locks are all lit from the start. Since these changes have been made, I felt like I had to redo a review.\n\nThe Remake of the Space Shuttle table, while challenging, is not too agravating. There are quite a few shots to go for, but a few of them tend to be quite difficult to get through. The voice that is heard through the table fits the theme well enough, but at the same time, can be generic at times. Starting a mode is especially easy to notice being tough to do, since it requires 4 shots to a kickout hole. Luckily, starting a mode will stay lit once one has been started, so experts shouldn't find much of an issue with that.\n\nHowever, the biggest complaint I have with this table is that there doesn't seem to be a way to restart Multiball. I feel like when the LAUNCH drop targets now light the Kickback, it's now impossible to light the locks again for Multiball. The spot target bank that is close to the left-most flipper gives out a lot of points when cleared, but that spot target bank could just as easily be used for lighting locks. Outside of those problems, this can be a fun table for a while if you want to practice how accurate you are.","timestamp_created":1557927998,"timestamp_updated":1559935985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605070173740386963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41sTbmesCcdOewQE="}
