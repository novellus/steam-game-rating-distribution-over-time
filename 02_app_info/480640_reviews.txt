There's a lot to unpack with this game. \n\nFirst off this is a video game based off of a board game.  That board game is a great game that I am very fond of and this video game is a faithful port of that game.  Over time the board game has been expanded upon greatly and those expansions have added a lot of really solid features and improvements.  This video game ONLY covers the initial offerings of the board game, not the numerous expansions that came later.  The result of this is that there are a lot of cards that would be great to see that simply don't exist in the video game.  For this port they also changed a few minor things (a couple of the characters have slightly different abilities on their cards).\n\nNone of this makes the game not enjoyable, it's just mildly disappointing.\n\nThe reason I wouldn't recommend this game though is how incredibly buggy it can be.  Nothing that makes the game unplayable.  Just lots and lots of little dumb bugs.  Cast scry during the final encounter?  You'll need to restart the client so you can cancel casting scry because you can't actually successfully use that spell there, it will trigger the same bug every single time.  Change your party around too many times in one sitting (to shuffle cards around between characters), that leads to the deck management interface crashing.  You'll need to restart the client.  I've had a few different games where I had to forfeit because the game bugged out and even after restarting the client I couldn't end the turn.  Just frustrating.\n\nSo in the end this is a good board game ported to pc mostly successfully, that crashes with uncomfortable frequency.  If you can deal with that, its a fun game.","timestamp_created":1609480556,"timestamp_updated":1609480556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3omh3vYCcfunvwI="}
