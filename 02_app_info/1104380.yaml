    review: "The Room VR is a fascinating take on the puzzle experience with Virtual\
      \ Reality. The game feels more like an escape room than a traditional puzzle\
      \ game. The use of ambiance and story telling drives home an unsettling feeling\
      \ throughout the levels of the game. If you enjoy the darkness of the Lovecraftian\
      \ genre then I'd highly recommend this game. \n\nPros:\n- Amazing ambiance\n\
      - Intriguing puzzles that utilize VR mechanics\nMeh:\n- The puzzles are not\
      \ especially difficult\nCons:\n- The game is short (Less than 4 hours)"
