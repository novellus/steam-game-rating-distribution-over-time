With this constraint, and carefully placed boxes, there are several puzzles that will give you headaches. Accompanied with beautiful graphics and smoothing music, this short puzzle game is definitely one of the best you will ever play  (9/10) !\n\nThe downside of this game is also obvious, there is only one mechanic. Compared to games made by Increpare or Johnathan Blow, you don't feel like learning something as you play through the level, which should be a key component for any puzzle games.\n\nOn a deeper level, saying that you learned nothing would be incorrect as you learned some abstract things like \"this placement of boxes is a certain death\". As you have more knowledge, your pruning speed increases, but I hope this is more intuitive.\n","timestamp_created":1609594753,"timestamp_updated":1609594753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/tnU4fYCcpLdvwI="}
