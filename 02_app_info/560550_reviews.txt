Next update, v1.6, was supposed to be released on 30. May 2018.\nIt has been 2 years. Dont really like how he is leaving this game unfinished here.\nHowever i was curious so i did some research - first I checked his twitter, no posts since March 2018. I checked his Steam Discussions posts and saw that he actually responded to a thread asking about the state of the game. He said that the full release is always on his mind. He responded with many posts, one being in Dec 2018, the next one in January 2020, a big leap there. His most recent community post is in the Subnautica forums.\nSo, I guess the dev is still semi-active, but posts a few times a year.\nI payed 10â‚¬ to support this developer, waiting for more updates, content and bug fixes. Havent gotten any in years.\nI mean, buy it if you want, but you wont be getting much. Who knows how long the hiatus will last.\n\nPosts: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010906732/posthistory/\nRoadmap: https://steamcommunity.com/games/560550/announcements/detail/1592451506866171355\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zentrifugegames","timestamp_created":1587676862,"timestamp_updated":1587676862,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw48q61PECeuqAgwI="}
