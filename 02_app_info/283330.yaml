    about_the_game: "Desert Thunder is an arcade-style action tank game for the PC.\
      \ Ripped from today\u2019s headlines, the storyline immerses players into the\
      \ heat of a desert-based military conflict. Players will tear through desert,\
      \ urban and industrial settings in their experimental battle engine, the Abrams\
      \ M1A6 Advanced tank that\u2019s loaded with awe-inspiring devastating weapons\
      \ and armored to near indestructibility. You are the commander of a top secret\
      \ M1A6 experimental tank division in the Armor Task Force. Your mission was\
      \ to lead the northern front of Operation Desert Thunder, a secret military\
      \ operation to overthrow a terrorist faction that has taken control of a peaceful\
      \ Middle Eastern country. Your mission has been compromised, your small battalion\
      \ devastated. Left with no alternative, you must complete your mission to reach\
      \ the capital city and rendezvous with allied forces."
