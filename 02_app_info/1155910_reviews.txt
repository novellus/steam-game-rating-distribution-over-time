I had to use the sound mixer in windows to stop myself going crazy), but mostly it just needs a bit more polish (in the UX area), and a bit more variety.\n\nMy top recommendations:\n\n- Let users turn of music.\n- Add better descriptions for towers (they might exist, but I could not find them).\n- Add some UI flair like having roll numbers show above towers, colour coded by hit or miss.\n- It was really confusing that the dark blue colour is an indicator of the range extensions, particularly because they show on towers that have no range upgrades. At first I thought maybe it was splash damage or something.\n- Needs more than 4 tower types (I only played for an hour, so did not see all levels, but the second level did not unlock any new towers and I suspect there aren't others based on UI)... or perhaps a skill tree or something mix things up as you progress.","timestamp_created":1569768981,"timestamp_updated":1569768981,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oLjhvu0CftaL0wE="}
