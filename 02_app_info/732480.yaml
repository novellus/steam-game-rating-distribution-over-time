    about_the_game: <strong>Play drums, Harp, and many more in this fun musical App
      for all ages!</strong><br><strong>Jam Session VR</strong> is the exact opposite
      of most music/rhythm games.  There are no notes you are expected to play, and
      no audience waiting to &quot;boo&quot; you for a bad performance.  Instead,
      find yourself surrounded by a plethora of different instruments, from drum set,
      to harp, to theremin, to timpani drums.<br>You'll also find an intuitive touch
      based sequencer to add full band orchestration with a few touches of a few buttons.   Relax
      in a beautiful meadow and play around on a lovely harp, or rain destruction
      from the skies as the drumming God of Thunder!

    review: Game was laggy and even when guardian was set up i still had to be careful
      not to touch my screen as this drumset needed more space to reach out to than
      was allowed by the guardian.  EG drums were outside the usable zone.  I had
      a refund due to the game crashing every time I clicked on the ball bouncing
      section.  The game was like glitchy too with the screen shimmering and flickering.  As
      for the lag on playing instruments the only ones that had any preciseness to
      them were the huge kettle drums cos you can smash them like a maniac and not
      notice.  I doubt anyone can play more than a few drum beats in a second so more
      of a toy app than an actual way to play instruments.  Be better if they just
      did a single drumkit properly.  Dissapointed.
