    review: "This game was a really pleasant surprise.  I got this thinking it was\
      \ just another detective point and click.  You know, a nice way to spend an\
      \ afternoon and support indie developers.  I got that, but a lot more too. \
      \ This game was really fun.  \n\nThe game description really underplays the\
      \ importance of choices.  You decide if you want to chase random items for people,\
      \ what you want to investigate in a very major way and how you do it.  Once\
      \ you choose, those other options are closed off and you have decided your fate.\
      \  At least until the next choice comes along.  How you handle conversations\
      \ with characters can help you or hurt you in all sorts of different ways. \
      \ \n\nBecause of the wide variations in how the story plays based on what you\
      \ decide to investigate, this game has a very high replayability factor.  And\
      \ the \"Grimsworth Reports\" you collect are saved for your next playthrough.\
      \  Very nice!\n\nThe one drawback that wore on me a little was the fact we are\
      \ playing in a very large game world and there is no map.  So if you forget\
      \ how to get to where you need to be, there can be times of wandering ... and\
      \ wandering.  The controls are a bit old school with you having to cycle the\
      \ cursor through walk, look, interact, and run.  And you have to keep clicking\
      \ the run across the sceen to move through the levels of town.  But if you can\
      \ deal with that, you get a very fun game in return.\n\nSuper mild spoiler -\
      \ [spoiler] find that cardboard box.  It's a life saver.  Literally. [/spoiler]"
