At its core is a 3d platformer but the devs tried to implement elements from adventures and some old school techniques with different cameras. The whole game breathes nostalgia from the 90's era. The graphics are inconsistent but that didnt bother me as that clearly wasnt the dev's main focus. Gameplay wise as others have said the ranger class is a little clunky with a gamepad but i got used to it. Voice actors did a good job though some were mediocre at best as it happens in low budget games. The music though shines and its by far the best quality of the game. Overall it will give you a good 8-10 hours gameplay in normal mode and then you can purchase skins and various stuff with in-game currency if you play again.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nMusic: 9/10\nStory: 7/10","timestamp_created":1567192575,"timestamp_updated":1573731788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482954531908035278","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzqzutO4CfdCx0QE="}
