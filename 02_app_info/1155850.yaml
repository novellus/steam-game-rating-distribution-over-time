      /><br><br>While traveling to the East the Vikings fall into a trap. Ragnald
      is saved by the accompanying wolf and must find his loved ones. The Viking and
      his companion are forced not only to survive but properly manage time, space,
      and energy to achieve the goal.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1155850/extras/lvkw_baner_01_en.png?t=1609162536"
      /><br>Early Middle Ages, 9th century, Eastern Europe. The Viking boats are drifting
      inland, looking for a convenient place for settlement. One of the greatest and
      the smartest warrior who was the leader of the expedition was Ragnald. Together
      with his wife and children as well as travel companions, they were looking for
      a safe land, rich in water, vegetation, and animals.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1155850/extras/lvkw_baner_02_en.png?t=1609162536"
      /><br>He was also accompanied by his faithful friend, Raga the wolf. It was
      supposed to be a peaceful voyage, but the expedition fell into an ambush set
      by women from the Kingdom of Women. Ruthless warriors captured women and children
      and killed all men. Almost everyone...<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1155850/extras/lvkw_baner_03_en.png?t=1609162536"
      /><br>With the help of Raga, the wounded Ragnald survived, and with little strength
      left the wolfhound pulled him to the other side of the river. Just before he
      fainted, he noticed his beloved Tove and children among the captives. When he
      awoke, his faithful wolf was laying next to him, and apart from the voices of
      nature, there was no sign of the attackers or the captured women or children.<br><br><img

      /><br>This is how Ragnald started his adventure into the unknown, through wild,
      dangerous areas, but also villages and settlements, though not always friendly.
      Raga's loyal companion will often prove to be a savior, rescuing him from wild
      animals, or helping in the hunt.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1155850/extras/lvkw_baner_05_en.png?t=1609162536"
      /><br>Ragnald and the wolf are facing a difficult path, the fight against the
      weather, wild forest, animals, fight for food, medicine, fight against hostile
      tribes... but the main motivation is to regain the loved one and children.<br><br><img
