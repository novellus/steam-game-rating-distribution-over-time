The character cntrols like a tank with the armor of paper airplane. \n\nThere are some spots that will kill you instantly or easily, making you start all over from the begining. this is a terrible way to make the game \"longer\" but I guess it worked. The \"needing more batteries shtick is tired as hell. could you imagine having a flashlight that lasted for 5 minutes before you needed new batteries? it is just a dumb game mechanic. \n\nThe story of this atrocity is almost none existent. some guy made things dark. . . dunno how. . . dunno why. . . but. . . ya, the main bad was thwarted by flipping the \"on/off\" switch on a telephone pole. of course, you have to go through a black hole to get to . . . somewhere. . . where the main bad is. . . . and. . . well. . . he is VERY black. . . like. . . the color though. the whole thing just looks feels and tastes awful.","timestamp_created":1527494956,"timestamp_updated":1527494956,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvury0uMCe/y9oQE="}
