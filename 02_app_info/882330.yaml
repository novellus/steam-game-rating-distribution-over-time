    about_the_game: 'We have prepared for you a game that is known and dear to many
      people around the world. Here is a classic Sudoku puzzle game in which you need
      to make squares of numbers, while avoiding repetition. The game has many levels
      of very different complexity-from the very simple to the most complex, created
      specifically for those who do not doubt their abilities.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882330/extras/Sudoku.jpg?t=1530277665"

      game<br></li><li>Beautiful graphics<br></li><li>Many Steam achievements<br></li><li>Support
      for Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul><br>The rules of the game are quite simple,
      but at the same time they impose some restrictions. The playing field consists
      of a square of 9 by 9 cells, which in turn is divided into 9 smaller squares.
      Some fields have numbers written in advance, and your task is to find the missing
      ones. You can enter numbers from 1 to 9, there is an important condition: in
      each smaller square, as well as the row and column of a large square should
      not be a single match. It sounds simple, but some of these puzzles are made
      up quite cleverly and will make you really try before you will find a solution.
      The game will brighten up your leisure time and develop your logic. Great for
      both adults and children.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882330/extras/os.png?t=1530277665"
