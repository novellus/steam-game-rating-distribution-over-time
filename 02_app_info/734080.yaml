    about_the_game: "Many years ago, a cruel king ruled over the people of Iran whose\
      \ only thoughts revolved around him and his court; an authoritarian king who\
      \ was rich beyond the dream of avarice while his people held their stomachs\
      \ out of hunger. The king becomes sick and lies on his deathbed. A miserable\
      \ rain-soaked cat named \u201CBabri Khan\u201D together with its kitten accidentally\
      \ enters the king\u2019s palace and somehow arrives at his room. Seeing that\
      \ the room is warm and cozy, the cat leaves the kitten under the king\u2019\
      s bed and intends to leave the house when it runs into the closed door. According\
      \ to a local superstition, if a cat leaves its kitten underneath a patient\u2019\

      \ develops a special liking for the cat, making it the apple of his court\u2019\

      \ moment, they dumped the cat in a well outside the city. Now Babri Khan begins\
