    review: 'This developer had starting adding garbage copy + paste overpriced DLC
      to each of the games on the VT publishing account before it was recently banned,
      this developer basically made a couple of DLC formats, hit CTRL + C then CTRL
      + V.


      He also upped the price for every one of his games & DLC back in march 2019
      up to 1000%! so his 90% discounts back to the original price would look better.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1927216178


      His other account ''''VT publishing'''' that had games such as Crankies Workshop
      & the Fitzzle series, got caught in that massive ban wave the other day but
      somehow this one got through.


      Taking inspiration from this developers ridiculous copy + paste attitude, I''ve
      decided to review his games in the same way.'
