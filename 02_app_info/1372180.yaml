      /><br>Starting from the city, living in the dream of a paper plane, yearning
      for an unexplored trip, the front is winding and verdant.<br>Avoid obstacles
      on the road, enjoy the scenery along the way, and listen to the ensemble of
      birds and flowers to one stop after another.<h2 class="bb_tag">Overview</h2>&quot;The
      Call of Paper Planes&quot; is a casual game with adventure elements. We hope
      this game can give players a travel-like experience. You can see all kinds of
      colorful landscapes during the game, and you also need to pay attention to avoid
      the various natural creatures in the scene that are curious about paper airplanes.
      You can also try to collect all the paper in the scenes to unlock the easter
      eggs.<h2 class="bb_tag">Book SeaSide</h2>The full verson is coming soon, and
      the last part of the trip to the seaside has been completed. It will be launched
      after Christmas!<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1372180/extras/lv27gif_01.gif?t=1608787282"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Style</h2>The game scenes are in pencil drawing style.
      Each scene is a page of pictures in the picture album. The towns, forests, and
      seasides along the way are unique pictures. As the travel progress progresses
      backward, players can experience more regional scenery.<h2 class="bb_tag">How
      to play</h2>The player uses the W key and S key of the keyboard to adjust the
      flying direction and speed of the paper airplane. When the paper airplane flies
      upward, the flying speed will slow down, and when the flying angle is downward,
      the flying speed of the paper airplane will become faster.<h2 class="bb_tag">Collect
      paper balls and rewards</h2>There are many luminous paper balls floating in
      the game scene. Obtaining these paper balls can unlock interactive items.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Various sound effects</h2>When the player approaches, the interactable
      objects and human voice can be heard, which increases the immersive experience.<br><br>If
