      from director John Carpenter (co-written by Nick Castle) that sets the screen
      ablaze with heart-stopping suspense, outrageous stunts and imaginative special
      effects. Bristling with riveting chases and hard-hitting fight sequences, Escape
      From New York is your passport to nonstop excitement! In a world ravaged by
      crime, the entire island of Manhattan has been converted into a prison which
      houses the world''s most brutal inmates. And when the President of the United
      States (Donald Pleasence) crash lands inside, only one man can bring him back:
      Snake Plissken (Russell), a notorious outlaw and former Special Forces war hero
      who, in exchange for a full pardon, descends into the decayed city and wages
      a blistering war against the captors. But time is short: in 24 hours, an explosive
      charge planted inside Snake''s body will end the mission and his life unless
      he succeeds!'
