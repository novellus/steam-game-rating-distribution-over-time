Imagine taking this bundle that help spawn literally hundreds of 99 cent and $1.99 garbage games on Steam and mashing together your own mess of default assets and asking $29.99 USD for it.  Well, look no further people, because that's exactly what this indie developer has done!  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTY3-BEPa4\n\nIf you dare read the about information from the game's main menu. you'll quickly see that a developer who struggles to put together a proper sentence has also exported this game you just paid $30 for.  It's the moment where you start to question your own intelligence and more importantly, your own sanity.\n\nThis GameGuru game is no different from the hundreds of others found on Steam except that this one has the nerve to ask $30 for instead of the common 99 cent price tag.  It's got all the crap we have come to hate in all GameGuru games... terrible textures, laughable AI, terrain stretched upwards to create sinfully ugly mountains, a obnoxiously loud heartbeat when you take any damage at all, etc.\n\nAvoid unless you can find it on some key selling website for under a quarter.  Then you might want to buy it, not for yourself, but as a gift to the most annoying friend you have on Steam.","timestamp_created":1583093312,"timestamp_updated":1583104321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58716428279876709","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43tyXzPACdbHJ9QE="}
