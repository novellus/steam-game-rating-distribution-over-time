      \ were based off DB\u2019s BR 627 units. They would be designed to fulfil quieter\
      \ duties on rural routes, being made of only a single vehicle and featuring\
      \ an on-board ticket machine, allowing people to purchase tickets without the\
      \ need for machines or additional staff at every station.<br><br>By 1995, a\
      \ total of 100 railcars had been built, replacing many older types of units\
      \ including some which pre-dated the Second World War, meaning rural lines across\
      \ Austria saw a step-change in comfort and reliability.<br><br>The railcars\
