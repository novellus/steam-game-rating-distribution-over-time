      Based on Germany's most popular pen &amp; paper role playing game, it was also
      the first German computer RPG series to get widely recognized outside of its
      home country. To this day it holds a stable hardcore fanbase that loves the
      games for their comprehensive adaption of the pen &amp; paper ruleset and the
      believable medieval fantasy setting.

    review: they put Zero effort into making the basic functions of the game, like
      it was still 1991.. good example, you put your cursor over something - you get
      nothing, no help.. ( as always, I don't refund ) *This game sucks, remember
      your poor choices in life.
