There is too many things that betray the mechanism of solving puzzles  here (like this). I ended up not trusting the game to be fair with its solutions.\n\nAlso, it's really difficult to grab things. Without a walkthrough you'll miss loads of items because you'll assume you can't pick them up after trying 2 or 3 times.","timestamp_created":1603651192,"timestamp_updated":1603651294,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5rEsPUCfqWNqgI="}
