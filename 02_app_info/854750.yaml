      \ a brand new Faction to the game: the Kapaku. Forced to leave their volcanic\

      \ /><br><br>Kapaku are native to volcanic terrain: they gain strong unit buffs\
      \ while on volcanic tiles and have productions perks that reward them for settling\
      \ on volcanic regions. Their gameplay focuses on leveraging these perks to field\
      \ large armies with quality gear, or teching quickly into wonders and deeds.\
      \  Although they rely heavily on this rare type of terrain, they wield the incredible\
      \ power of \u201CLavaformation\u201D, allowing them to change any terrain into\
      \ Volcanic Tiles permanently. While they may be strangers to Auriga, the Kapaku\
      \ always have the Home Turf advantage!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/854750/extras/LIFE.jpg?t=1573401860\"\

      \ world ravaged by Sowers, they can exploit the new terrain much better than\
      \ any other faction, although they require large amounts of strategic resources\
      \ to use their abilities to their fullest. They possess unique knowledge of\
      \ the Dust Eclipses, granted by the Endless themselves.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/854750/extras/LEADER.jpg?t=1573401860\"\

      \ becomes thick with dust, dormant powers awaken in the denizens of Auriga,\
      \ giving each faction new powers or improving their existing capacities to terrifying\
      \ new levels. This same dust infusion creates short-lived \u201CDust Confluxes\u201D\
      \ all over the map, bestowing a temporary boon to whatever army reaches them\

    review: 'A Bullet Point DLC review:


      -Inferno adds Dust Eclipses, short lived time periods where Ruins can be explored
      again, and powerful new buffs (Confluxes) sprinkled across the world. Every
      faction generally gets some sort of boost from a Dust Eclipse as well.

      -It also adds Lava Terrain, foodless terrain that gives high science, dust,
      and industry - lava rivers add to industry very much. It''s basically a non
      starter for every race, though, unless....

      -You''re the Kapaku, the new faction able to get food from lava tiles, terraform
      other land into lava tiles, make very cheap upkeep golems, and make Golem Camps
      across the map that serve as unconnected districts, able to farm another 6 tiles
      when other civs can''t make a second city in the region. They also get the best
      bonuses from Dust Eclipses.

      -The Kapaku are a very strong faction, both offensively (their units are powerful,
      cheap, regenerate, and get terrain based bonuses, even off lava.) and defensively.
      (lava terrain deals hostile attrition damage to enemies, unless you''re the
      Kapaku.) their story quests are also incredibly easy, and they''re the best
      poised to take advantage of Dust Eclipses and confluxes, which give them a bigger
      bonus than anyone in the game.

      -You cannot un-terraform lava terrain. This means any game where the Kapaku
      exist will slowly be taken over into Lava, with no recourse for other civilizations.
      This seems like a big miss, and unfun lategame for non-Kapaku factions.


      Overall - while well produced, and fun if you''re the Kapaku themselves, the
      balance for this expansion feels off in almost every way. I tend to play with
      the expansion disabled, which is a shame, because I like dust eclipses, but  Ireally
      dislike Lava terrain and the Kapaku when handled by an AI. The addition of un-lava
      terraforming should have been an easy counter for sanity, but wasn''t put in.


      I''m giving the DLC a negative rating not because I think it''s a poor DLC per
      se, but because I think it''s a poor addition to the overall game experience
      - unless you''re playing as the Kapaku themselves, where you have an absolutely
      wonderful time with everything. It''s very lopsided.'
