    review: "Great game for the price! It's simple family fun. Just time your dropped\
      \ monster with the power gauge to make sure you make a big impact! One thing\
      \ I really like about this game is the option for an AI so you can play on your\
      \ own if you can't find someone to play with you. I hate buying a game only\
      \ to find out you have to wait for someone to join your game.  The graphics\
      \ are super cute and it's fairly fast to learn. Even without instructions, I\
      \ was able to figure the game out after playing a few times. This game makes\
      \ a nice break after doing some chores! Perfect for friends or family! My honest\
      \ opinion: Buy the game! It's only $4! Perfect for value! I didn't get a discount\
      \ or money for this review.\n\nPROS;\nCute graphics\nFun for family and friends\n\
      Option for AI player or play with family/friends\nGOOD VALUE for money\n\nCONS:\n\
      Needs explanation for CONTROLS and HOW TO PLAY\nNo Hard difficulty?\n\nCONTROLS\n\
      S gives you the option of a special character (on bottom left-usually a whale\
      \ or a yellow monster)\nuse your arrow keys on keyboard to move your monster\
      \ (use the shadow to see where it will fall)\nPress Space to drop your character\n\
      Pay attention to the power gauge on bottom right\nDropping your monster on barrel\
      \ bombs helps knock other monsters out\nGoal:Knock the other monsters out of\
      \ the ring!\nMake sure not to knock your own character out of the ring if you\
      \ want points!\n\nFUTURE IMPROVEMENTS \nDeveloper needs to add controls and\
      \ how to play.\nI would like the option for less rounds (5 as a minimum instead\
      \ of 10).\nAdd a hard difficulty (honestly just by adjusting the bounciness\
      \ of the creatures to 10 would do the trick).\nIt is confusing who is who at\
      \ the top of the page because the numbers change according to your points so\
      \ one moment I was player 1 then suddenly player 3 before I realized those were\
      \ points not the player. I think there should be a player image up there (you\
      \ could have player 1 be a cat for example, player 2 whale, player 3 the yellow\
      \ monster, player 4 a barrel bomb) or give players the option to choose.\n\n\
      IDEAS\nIn the future, I would love to see more places added to play like a pirate\
      \ ship or rainforest for example so maybe 5 options total.  And new challenges\
      \ like bombs dropping and floors falling out. Or mini-games like playing tic\
      \ tac toe by dropping monsters. or paint a room by dropping monsters who splatter\
      \ paint ect. It'd be cool if you could choose your character at the top of the\
      \ screen to make it easier to tell which player you are. And there could be\
      \ a few more types of monsters or getting to choose what color your monsters\
      \ are. I think with just a few more features added (like 3 mini-games) this\
      \ game price could easily go up in value by a few dollars. I would say with\
      \ a few improvements $7 would be good. You could have DLCs for things like 5\
      \ mini-games for $5 or extra characters DLC for $4 if you want to keep the base\
      \ game the same price but still want people willing to pay extra for mini-games\
      \ and extra features happy.\n\nOVERALL: FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE, I WOULD BUY THIS\
      \ GAME AGAIN!"
