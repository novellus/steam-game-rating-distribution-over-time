I'm a bit of a sucker for cooking games. This one, though, is by far my favorite - on any platform, of any type. It is absolutely perfectly paced. It is definitely challenging, but very fair, and just when you master your tools, something new is thrown in. The medieval setting is unique and engaging, and the ability to improve your food stall with beefed-up ovens, pots, etc. gives the game a very campaign-like feel. A few times during the game you get a major promotion (from serving peasants to nobility, and then from nobility to royalty), giving you an entirely new set of customers, new recipes, and a new kitchen.\n\nIf you enjoy this type of time-management cooking simulation, I really can't recommend this enough. It is super fun, super cute, and super rewarding when you finally master those tough recipes. The \"boss\" stages - where you have to cook a large quantity of recipes quickly for a party - can be a bit tough, but honestly, they don't happen often and offer up a fun challenge.\n\nSummary:\nGraphics: 4/5\nImmersion: 4/5\nFun: 5/5\nComfort: 5/5\nFitness: 3/5\nThieving Crows Pelted with Cheese: 207","timestamp_created":1605240054,"timestamp_updated":1609576941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502617835998535156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43OCQ4fYCdriGrgI="}
