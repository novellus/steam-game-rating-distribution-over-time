TOO ACCURATE FOR MY OWN TASTE.\n\nEdit: I initially left a positive review, but after a few hours in (I was at the 4th day), I'm changing it to a negative one. There's only one probleme, but boy, it's a big one: technical issues, including a bug blocking my progression (I checked with other people who played this game and even watched walkthroughts, and I'm doing everything correctly, the issue isn't with me).\n\nI tried playing this game on another computer (and since cloud saves don't work, it was quite the hassle to retrieve my save), same problem. \n\nIt seems I'm not the only one encountering bugs (for example, a lot of people seem to not unlock achievements), so... Nope, don't buy this game. I really wish it worked, but as much as I like the writing and the general design, I can't recommand a game that refuse to let me play it.","timestamp_created":1609388604,"timestamp_updated":1609429281,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jr3d3PYCfMz/vgI="}
