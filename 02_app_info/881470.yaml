    review: 'Great fun little arcade action game. Definitely worth the price.


      Update: This game is highly addictive.


      Update 2: Can''t stop playing this. This game should go viral. Probably needs
      a better tutorial (not that it is difficult) and an online leader board, but
      I am not complaining. Can''t see what the developer comes up with next.


      Update 3: This game is every bit as good as my all time favourite short arcade
      action games (i.e. Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe, Super Crate Box and Russian
      Subway Dogs).


      Update 4: Still completely addicted to this game. One of my favourite games
      of all time. It is one of the most under rated games on Steam.'
