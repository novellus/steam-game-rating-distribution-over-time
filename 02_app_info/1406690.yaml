    about_the_game: "Kasi is a simple game where you play as a plant. You start as\
      \ a humble seed planted in the ground. You can create branches and leaves to\
      \ collect sunlight, and roots to collect water. Having these in a good balance\
      \ gives you energy to grow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou design the shape of your\
      \ plant. You can go straight up and grow into a mighty tree, or you can stay\
      \ low to the ground and be a nice hedge. You can grow vines which can snake\
      \ along branches and across the ground. You can use regular leaves that collect\
      \ sunlight, or special ones that collect moonlight. Growing flowers allows you\
      \ to be pollinated and grow fruits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world around your\
      \ plant is simple. The days lead into nights. Rain can fall and give you extra\
      \ water. Birds come and go from your branches. The sun and moon move at different\
      \ speeds, so sometimes there are eclipses. Stars can burst for extra light at\
      \ night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKasi is rendered with a minimalist aesthetic and\
      \ only a small amount of visual flair.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy!"

    short_description: Be a plant. Manage water and sunlight for photosynthesis. Grow
      branches into the sky and roots into the earth. Become the tallest, most efficient
      tree, a snaking vine with many shoots, or just a nice bush.
