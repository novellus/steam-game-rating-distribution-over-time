[b]The search for DEEP loving[/b] is a bit like an interactive visual novel. Each day, the main character receives up to five messages, each from a potential partner or [i]killer.[/i] After speaking to a character enough times, they will offer to go on a date. You may skip any number of dates ([i]often for your own safety[/i]). Dialogue is predetermined, and the only player agency is choosing whether or not to go on a date ([i]also[/i] with predetermined dialogue). Many dates can lead to game-overs, but there is usually a means to avoid getting arrested or killed. It goes without saying that you should [b]save often.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe protagonist is on a hunt to find a romantic partner via the dating app “FOD”. Unwilling to pay the (exorbitant) monthly fee, he is determined to find a partner within the thirty-day trial. To his dismay, the username “I Want the D” is already taken — I was then prompted to name him. Lacking a “default” name, I typed [i]IWANTHED[/i] (pronounced “I wan’ the D” or “I want heD”. Either way gets the point across.)\n\nHuh, I guess he was right — [i]I Want the D[/i] [b]is[/b] already taken!\n\nIWANTHED pokes around the FOD and meets ogles of prospective men (or in one case, a woman in need of a gay man). He meets a few wholesome individuals, but [i]mostly[/i] druggies, molesters, murderers, and a wide variety of shady-sketchy men. Which men IWANTHED ends up hangin’ with (or getting [i]hanged by[/i]) is up to you. Most, if not all of the available dates are optional, and don’t go past the first day.\n\nBut nobody likes to have a [i]dry bone,[/i] am I right?\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen is a standard, below-average RPGMaker screen. From “Options”, you may adjust audio and gameplay preferences. The in-game visuals are RPGMaker defaults, and otherwise remarkable. While I was impressed by the number of character portraits, I was [b]not[/b] impressed by the sheer crudeness of the art. Now, I understand that the art style is supposed to lend itself to the comedic tone of the game. However, it mostly strikes me as [i]childish[/i] than funny. Regardless, I do appreciate the variety of visuals, which contrast from the otherwise generic RPGMaker sprites.\n\n[b]- The Goods-[/b]\nWhile there are sex scenes and [i]rapey[/i] situations, sexual content is implied or glossed over. While the plot revolves around a man in search of the D, I would not consider this to be an “adult-game” in the traditional sense. While I have my reservations (regarding the artist), I would have still liked to have seen sexual content. Maybe I [b]wanted[/b] to see two grown men eat gravy off of each other after stuffing themselves stupid with tacos!\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI don’t recommend this game, but I think some people might get a kick out of it. [b]The search for DEEP loving[/b] is an interesting concept, and I had a few laughs as I played this game. Most of the humor fell flat for me, hardly nuanced and often shoved in my face. It was so painfully obvious when a character was supposed to be [i]creepy[/i] or [i]funny[/i] that there might as well been laugh tracks — as long as the writers think I’m a dumb reader, they might as well let me know when to laugh.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/the-search-for-deep-loving/]To read the full length review, click here![/url][/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\n[b]<3[/b] Follow the [b]Wombat Trap Curator[/b] page for more reviews!
