As you fight your way through the hordes of different alien soldiers; you also need to plan your route through interesting terrain from rocky peaks to forests and hackable teleporters. The terrain and graphics are beautiful with flexible quality settings for older pcs like mine. The gunplay is great with a variety of weapons and scoping options; made all the more thrilling at the constant danger of being outflanked. The A.I. are relentless hunting you down and pathfinding through navigating difficult terrain.\n\nA great and under-rated game has become all the more polished since the February update. Adding new maps, gamemodes, better optimization and a shop. They've also recently added matchmaking and online multiplayer. Well worth the time and modest price point.","timestamp_created":1551184031,"timestamp_updated":1551184031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497031658887863159","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40b3xlOkCe7PtuwE="}
