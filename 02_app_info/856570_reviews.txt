Skills depend on your weapon loadout, most attacks are telegraphed, it's a pretty fun game.  I only have a few things to note:\n1) When I first launched the game on both my desktop and laptop for the first time my inventory was opened and could not be closed.  After closing the game and relaunching it I didn't experience it again, but I did see it on both desktop and laptop the first time I booted it up on either.\n2) Multi-tile enemy AI can be kinda dumb when trying to get through a door, I've had instances where they should walk up or down a  tile or two to go through a door to get to me but won't unless I move in that direction\n3) Huge pet peeve of mine though it should be simple to fix, sometimes the numpad cannot navigate through a menu and I have to use the arrow keys like the starting screen, it'd be really nice to be able to use the numpad there too\n\nOther than those three minor issues this game shows a lot of promise :)","timestamp_created":1609269544,"timestamp_updated":1609269544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxJD81/YCdebEvgI="}
