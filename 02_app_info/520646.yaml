    review: "The book in itself is not all that great if you are looking for an independent\
      \ from the game type of book. However, if you enjoy the game the story makes\
      \ alot of sense and leaves you with some good topics of philosophical debate.\
      \ I do not wish to bring in spoilers, therefore the review will be different\
      \ from your normal review type. \n\nI really enjoy the depth the author brought\
      \ in the reasoning, though in my opinion the scenario in itself is a bit simplistic\
      \ and over the edge of utopiah (almost as bad as Star Treck). By reasoning I\
      \ mean the author obviously put some serious thought behind each individual\
      \ reply and gives you so much to think about that you can't just say this is\
      \ a bad guy. Actually, I had a hard time, and still do, to pin the <<evil>>\
      \ tag on the right donkey. \n\nThe end is open. I hope there will be a sequel."
