He told me that I should try his game with a similar name to that game and thought I'd like this game much better...\n\nWell, this developer obviously cares nothing about his customers and almost a year after launching this game on Steam, still hasn't fixed an obvious resolution problem with his game.  I described my problem to him a week ago in his forum thread on the topic and he still hasn't bothered to even respond.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeT6GZ1DisY&t=7s\n\nNot to mention, even when I bypass the resolution problem and launch the game, this game is even more dull and boring to play than the asset flip Neon Galaxy Wars I gave an 11% score to last year and criticized for not even having proper collision detection.\n\nThis game gets a 0 out of 40 for value, a 0 out of 30 for fun, a 3 out of 20 for controls & bugs which are god awful and the major resoltion bugs he can't even be bothered to fix, and a 2 out of 10 for graphics and sound.  Add that all up, you wind up with a total of a 5% score (out of 100) and a terrible game.  \n\nAvoid.  Not recommended.","timestamp_created":1527956702,"timestamp_updated":1527972851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487976670265197754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40+2R4eMCdev3oQE="}
