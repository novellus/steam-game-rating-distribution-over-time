    about_the_game: The official soundtrack to <i>A Monster's Expedition (Through
      Puzzling Exhibitions)</i> is composed and produced by <strong>Eli Rainsberry</strong>,
      with album art by <strong>Adam deGrandis</strong>.<br><br>The soundtrack is
      an eclectic mix of guitar and piano-led instrumentation, with roots and inspiration
      in ambient and jazz, and some classical elements. The soundtrack begins with
      establishing guitar notes that swells to a full band ensemble, before settling
      down to its ambient state.<br><br>A handful of the tracks from the soundtrack
      are real-time arrangements from each set of themes as progress unfolds. Each
      dynamic palette is inspired by the preceding theme as you get to certain points
      in the game. Jazz interludes play as you take time to sit by the ocean, or during
      other states of resting intervals.
