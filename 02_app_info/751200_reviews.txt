For those commenting negatively, the graphics are not the point, its the gameplay.  I wish there were more levels.  It reminds me of Alpha versions of games I used to work on in the early 90s.  Kudos to the developer, it was well worth the few bucks I paid for it.","timestamp_created":1589344688,"timestamp_updated":1589344688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+OqUhvICc6CyhwI="}
