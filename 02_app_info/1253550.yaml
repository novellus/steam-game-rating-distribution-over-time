    review: 'not worth it, missing a huge bunch of very basic features that are all
      in the PRO versions.

      can''t even do proper masking that even freewave apps can support (that was
      my deal-breaker)

      this is basically windows movie maker with some cool extras a very professional
      UI and high quality encoding/decoding.


      but for proper editing you will need to look at the pro spectrum'
