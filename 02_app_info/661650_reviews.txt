It's got an enjoyable Try-Die-Repeat (think FTL) form of resource management gameplay. Unfortunately, it's marred by some UI bugs that I seem to keep running into that prevent me from doing things like selecting buildings to craft things or proceeding to roll out before the timer runs out and you get a game over, so I'm not really going to invest much more time into it right now.","timestamp_created":1599636491,"timestamp_updated":1599636491,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r/nwuPQCd4/coAI="}
