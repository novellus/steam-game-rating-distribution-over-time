I'm surprised it doesn't have more of a following. It's definitely an overlooked gem providing a different kind of play experience. I love coming across something new. I've been playing video games since the early 1970's, so am always delighted when a game takes me to new places. The story telling is cheesy, but it has a creative way of getting you introduced to the game, and the overall design is new. It has good music and nice graphics.\n\nIt has its flaws, though. It's a bit rough around the edges and has a few annoying bugs, but none that are game breaking. The worse is pausing and un-pausing the game can reset your character back to the beginning of a level. That's only a real problem when level exploration is important for advancing the story. As mentioned, I think the story telling, especially at the start, is a little lame. But that's OK; MCI Escapes isn't about the story, so much.\n\nIs it worth the price? Yes, I think very much so. The game play may not be lengthy, but it's enjoyable in its current state. I like what I've seen so far, and hope it grows.","timestamp_created":1561594134,"timestamp_updated":1561930771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515625","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4o4WV1esCcO+xxAE="}
