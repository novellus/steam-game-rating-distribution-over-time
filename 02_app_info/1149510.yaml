    review: 'Tl;dr has a good story, interesting main character, but bad skip function
      may be a deal breaker (the skip function didn''t work for me, but it might work
      for you). Give the VN a try only if you''re willing to be patient bearing in
      mind the inability to consistently skip old text (and a medium text speed at
      best when not skipping).


      I would certainly recommend this visual novel, though only if you''re a patient
      reader. Without going too into detail, it details life under a Chinese dynasty
      (I think) while also presenting topics such as natural habitat preservation
      vs. industrial construction. The game follows a main protagonist from the beginning
      of the story but also switches character perspectives every so often to add
      more details (although, I feel there should be more occasions where this takes
      place, as I remember it only occurring once or twice throughout the VN as a
      whole).


      This VN also provides the player choices on occasion and has some bad endings,
      although there are also Steam achievements for each ending, and you''ll need
      to reach at least a few of these endings in order to reach the true ending,
      so be open to playing out each ending.


      HOWEVER, one fair warning! From my personal experience, this VN has a hard time
      skipping past certain dialogue in comparison to what you would expect from normal
      VNs with a skip feature. Keep this in mind and be extra sure to save at each
      choice to mitigate the time spent backtracking.'
