Optimized well, I never experienced VR lag or glitches. Game should really be Multiplayer tho, but still is fun solo. I paid $1:00. And I for one really enjoyed this game. It gives you a rush at moments and can be very fun. Only problem that it's not multiplayer and this game could benefit from it.","timestamp_created":1567650794,"timestamp_updated":1567650794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoZnR/+wCd7TY0QE="}
