    review: Pretty neat game, I do recommend this for fans of old-stype 2D Space Shooters
      such as R-Type. What I don't like is that It can be hard to tell when you take
      damage (for example the first time I died to the larger ships I had no idea
      what was damaging me as I wasn't anywhere near them or any bullets). What I
      do like is the controls and the power-ups really make the game interesting.
