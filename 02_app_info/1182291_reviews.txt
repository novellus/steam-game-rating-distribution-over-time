I didn't want to drop 90 bucks on the full game, 20 bucks is much less of a risk and allows you to try the whole game engine in only 15 scenarios. i now have 130 hours in and am only on #10. lots more gaming to do, i consider this a steal. It has a very high learning curve but if you spend time on the tutorials, do them several times, it all will click in. Modern battle systems are much more complex than i realized and this simulation has definately taught me a ton about modern warfare in the electronic age. This is not a button smasher game, but there are times when you have to play at real time to get things done because alot is going on. Download the picture mod for the data base and game on, two thumbs up, i now know i will buy the larger complete CMANO once i survive this battle simulation first!","timestamp_created":1594328617,"timestamp_updated":1594328736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54921799898147583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkLzZmvMCfZuTlAI="}
