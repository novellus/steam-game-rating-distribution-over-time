    developer_response: 'What is your headset model?

      You have to use axis joystick controller to move reference point and press button
      where you want to teleport.

      I think it is easy and intuitive. But I will include some instructions. You
      can see video promotion where you can see the different options.

      There are another kind of movements: with joystick, moving controllers, you
      can try it.

      I hope you can enjoy better it in your next game play.'

    review: 'Does not work, don''t waste  your money.   Instructions are non-existent.  Shows
      a circle to use to teleport but no way to actually teleport.  No hint of objectives
      or game play, they expect you to just figure it out as you go.  No guides.  No
      discussion of any kind.  Until now, no user reviews to let you know how bad
      it is.


      If there is anyway to actually play this game there are no instructions to let
      you know how to do so.'
