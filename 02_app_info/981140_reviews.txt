Now it is the game in the trailer. I played not much because the controls with the mouse are weird, but maybe the game is ok for some players. \n\n\nOUTDATED REVIEW:\n\nThe Game is not the game shown in the trailer or the screenshots. It is just another Unit Z- Battlegrounds assett flip. There is nothing more to say. Avoid it.\n\nGameplay video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4_D0KihL_I","timestamp_created":1567537841,"timestamp_updated":1604858780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673623025417327881","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlrPC1PUCeJTQ0QE="}
