It's literally unplayable on my laptop (intel gfx) and there's nothing on-screen that justifies it. The framerate is so low that you can hear enemies die a good second before it happens on screen. Apparently the devs have been using RPGMaker or sthg similar and it shows. A f**ing farce.\nThere is an option for lower graphics in the menu, but it does nothing. In fact all the options go back to the default settings as soon as I leave the options menu and nothing is saved.\n\nIt was not even obvious that there was a config menu and good luck finding what to click on the world map to progress too.\n\nThe game would have been great with a good engine. I love the  theme, the graphic style and the one-screen arcade-style gameplay reminiscent of old classics such as snow bros. \nUnfortunately there is also a problem with the gameplay that ramps up so fast that you'll probably quit as soon as you reach the second world area. But most player will probably not reach it. I don't have anything against difficulty, but this is too much.\n\nOh, and yeah, meme speak doesn't bring anything good to your game. It detracts from it.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1601658627,"timestamp_updated":1601658659,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457614392042160034","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i/SS9fQCfcG3pQI="}
