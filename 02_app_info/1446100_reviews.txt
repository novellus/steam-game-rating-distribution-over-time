There is no check points, but you can stun the monster once or twice depending if you find a sphere.  Developers please make this game have 4 spheres on easy, so people can enjoy your escape.  Yes very short experience but overall felt like a challenge.  Great work for a indie game, 1 hour max game, expand the game to a bigger base and some not pickups would be great.  If you are getting frustrated, stay away from the monster and you should be fine.","timestamp_created":1608588209,"timestamp_updated":1608591230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww8jgw/YCdPqEvAI="}
