    about_the_game: FINAL FANTASY VI first debuted in 1994 as the sixth instalment
      in the iconic FINAL FANTASY series. Innovations included the ability to play
      all the main characters as the game's protagonist, and to this day, its epic
      story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular.<br><br>With
      plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells/summoning,
      players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first
      FINAL FANTASY game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of
      all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.<br><br><strong><u>Story</u></strong><br>The
      War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself
      had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade
      the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines
      and technologies.<br><br>But there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a
      young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to
      harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and
      a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire's clutches sets
      in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable
      conclusion.<br><br><u><strong>Key Features</strong></u><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Veteran
