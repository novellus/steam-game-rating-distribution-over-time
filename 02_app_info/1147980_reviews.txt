Way too easy, way too short (see that playtime? I've completed main story and quite a few of side missions), story is incomprehensible but quite fun due to very poor English translation. Couldn't recommend spending more that few bucks on it just for so bad it's good kind of experience. \nAlso this isn't the same game as PS4 Gene Rain. \nGame resets back to Chinese after every restart.","timestamp_created":1606938361,"timestamp_updated":1606938572,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzpbAkvYCeNHqtgI="}
