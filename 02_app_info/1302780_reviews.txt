You're defending multiple floors simultaneously within a zombie-infested building. Using \"energy\" that is slowly accumulated over time, you deploy up to three troops per floor in an \"elevator\" on the left side, and you can swap one elevator with another to relocate your sets of three. Although there is a cooldown associated with the swap, you'll be able to switch and send your firepower where and when it is needed.\n\nEach of the troops you can deploy can be upgraded through the application of five \"badges,\" that improve things like damage, fire rate, deployment cost, etc. Three badges of the same type and level can be combined to create a badge of a higher level. I liked this system, although there were a few times when you'd merge badges and put yourself in a disadvantageous position - there were times when I merged three level eight badges to create a level nine, but then the next-highest badge I had would be a level two. You can spread the three level eight badges across three characters, whereas this isn't the case with the single level nine badge. One annoyance here is that you need to unequip badges to combine them between levels. I'd much rather the game just automatically unequip any badges that were used to fuse a higher level one. I spent a lot of time equipping and unequipping badges while playing.\n\nThe other gameplay aspects are the gadgets and items. You can equip up to three gadgets, and each recharges slowly after use. I stuck with the snap (kills a certain % of zombies on screen), the adrenaline shot (makes a set of three zombies shoot more quickly for a time), and a spike trap (that damages enemies that cross it). Outside of the spike trap, I mostly just used the gadgets during final waves or boss fights. Although you're given a few starter items (one-time-use consumables), items are so incredibly expensive that I wouldn't be surprised if you never bought any more. I don't even think I obtained the medal for using 10 items, and the game gives you 5 for free. The game also contains an upgrade system that you can use to increase your overall health, energy gain, gadget recharge, soldier damage, etc. This is well implemented and easy to use.\n\nI enjoyed my time with the game - I'd often put on music and just watch my soldiers go to work. At the beginning of the game I mostly used the rocket launcher and SMG soldier, but by the end I was entirely reliant upon the sniper and a green, space marine-looking fellow who could remove all armor with a single shot. I also liked the creative enemy design, and the way that each set of levels introduces a new mechanic to shake things up (escalators, walkways, teleporters, healing modules, etc.).","timestamp_created":1609786285,"timestamp_updated":1609786682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqe2w5/YCddW8wAI="}
