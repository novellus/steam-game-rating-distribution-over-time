    review: "This game is lacking in a lot of ways. The movement is slow until you\
      \ train it up.  The guidance is pretty lax overall. The graphics are funky.\n\
      If all of that is true, why am I recommending it. The freedom, the scale and\
      \ the depth of the procedural generation.  This is the kind of game you could\
      \ enjoy forever once you get past the bad parts.  I actually enjoyed the combat\
      \ and jumping around dodging attacks, even without fancy animations, it's still\
      \ enjoyable and there is a level of skill to it that can help you beat harder\
      \ opponents. There also is a fairly robust simulation where nations wage war\
      \ against each other which you can fight in, or you could just mine for resources\
      \ which also help the nation you are donating them to rank up.\nNpcs can be\
      \ slaughtered, kings can be overthrown, etc. You can go around backstabbing\
      \ people as a rogue if you want. \nThat to me is the real appeal of the game.\
      \ The fact that you can do these complex things even if the interface leaves\
      \ something to be desired.\n\nEdit: 20 hour check in.  After learning more mechanics\
      \ and learning more of the breadth of what you can do. Wow.  I mean, there are\
      \ some really interesting mechanics here and the simulation is real.  When you\
      \ start smiting armies by yourself, it feels amazing.  Even just beating people\
      \ up in bars is fun.  I definitely recommend this. You can become a king and\
      \ have kids and have trains bring resources around and elevate the wealth of\
      \ the nation.  I can't even understand how awesome it is.  It is huge too. \
      \ I wish this existed when I was a kid because you can play for hours and hours.\n\
      Edit:25 hours.  I discovered a few new things.  You can hire NPC's and you can\
      \ knock down walls and build up your own base.  I don't fully understand this\
      \ part of it yet but it is seeming pretty good.\nEdit: 40 hours in: I took a\
      \ kingdom, made half-elf babies with a princess. The children are growing up.\
      \ I've inscribed my weapons with magic words. Got a full set of wizard/sorcery/intelligence\
      \ equipment and became very powerful casting spells that I've learned as the\
      \ player to cast(by typing or using scrolls and inscribed wands).  I've set\
      \ up hundreds of wizards over my kingdom to defend me.  I've set up stores for\
      \ people to shop at.   I have my own prosperous wizard nation and it feels good.\
      \  Combining magic words to create compound effect spells and training up magic\
      \ spheres is satisfying long term."
