I also quite liked the diversity of it all, and unlike other CoG games where your choice of sexuality/gender identity is more cosmetic, it is actually explored a little bit in the story.\n\nHowever, the plot itself was very confusing. I got the achievement where your character apparently has \"learned all the secrets of the house\" but I could not tell you what was going on at all, and the ending left me scratching my head. The choices along the way seemed to be pretty important, though, so maybe it was just the path I chose, and all the weird stuff going on with the house and the antagonists is explained in another branch. \n\nIt certainly seems like it has a lot of replay value, though I wish CoG made it easier to explore other choices by allowing you to save and reload. But that's more of a general issue than one particular to this game.","timestamp_created":1607825338,"timestamp_updated":1607825338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6fX2rPYCdrLXuQI="}
