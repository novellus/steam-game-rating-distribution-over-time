    review: Not really sure what or even if there was a story or message, but as a
      visual experience I enjoyed this. Plenty of options for sound controls fov to
      make it a comfortable experience and really let you get lost in the game for
      a bit. Levels aren't too confusing, but the dialog is. Maybe it's because I
      haven't put in the time to read the footnoted content in the credits before
      playing to understand the placement of quotes and such, or maybe it's just simply
      meant to be confusing as part of the experience. Also Found a potato so that
      was the most rewarding thing I got from this game lol. I appreciated the potato.
      I played through it a second time to look at the things I missed which was nothing
      major, just a few quotes as far as I can tell. Anyways, it's cheap, takes a
      few minutes give it a try if the screenshots look appealing to you.
