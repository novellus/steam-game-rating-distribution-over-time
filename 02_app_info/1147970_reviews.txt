Note, there are a couple of bugs to watch out for. When you get the headset, don't get it near walls and don't take it off when you get into a virtual space with it. It disappears there's no way to go forward from there. However, once you know the solutions to puzzles, you can quickly start over and get back to where you were. Considering the short play time, bugs, and  lack of re-playablity, I'm not sure I would recommend it at the full price. I got it at 50% and after having fun playing another Overflow game, Star Shelter. Based on that experience I was pretty sure this would be fun, which it was. There's so much creativity coming from basically just 2 guys, can't wait to see their future endeavors!","timestamp_created":1609810663,"timestamp_updated":1609810663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45aqM6PYCcufIwAI="}
