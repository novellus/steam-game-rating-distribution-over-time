    review: WonderCat Adventures. Like Wonder Women but a cat??? nah. This is SPACE
      KITTY in a rad 3 legged super robot, on a mysterious planet, looking for his
      kitty friend.  A simple one click platformer game, that all you do is jump jump
      jump to get though the levels and collect gems. Levels put you through the typical
      jump over, under, on and through fire, air, mechanical deathtraps and baddies
      like bats, on a giant cart system. The cart railway is just there with this
      cart and you use it. The collections for gems, I don't know why... maybe for
      his kitty friend? or fuel for his rad 3 legged super robot? The music is upbeat
      and the graphics are pretty clean cut with a style I personally liked. The chill
      looking black cat in his rad 3 legged super robot is nifty. I do wish there
      was lasers or something epic added, but it'll do.  Bosses like giant crabs are
      interesting and different. For a fun, little, simple, click, adventure I think
      it's a good game. Especially for all those cat enthusiasts and crazies out there
      that need a cat super hero. WONDERCAT IS HERE!!!! With 50 something levels and
      5 worlds and 5 bosses, it'll keep you busy for a while.
