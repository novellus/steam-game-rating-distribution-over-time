      \ face!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuper Meat Boy RACE MODE is here!<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThat's right! Now you can sit on the couch with a buddy (or enemy) and try\
      \ to see who is the better Meatsmen. Split Screen race through chapters in order,\
      \ or randomly, or race through the whole game its up to you! <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want a real challenge,\
      \ test out our artisanal Race Mode chapters hand forged by some of the most\
      \ sadistic lunatics in our wonderful Super Meat World community! We made a few\
      \ chapters and we'll rotating out these chapters every once in a while. Find\
      \ them under the &quot;Featured&quot; chapter when selecting chapters in Race\
      \ Mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHAT'S NOT ENOUGH OF A CHALLENGE YOU SAY????<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nWell...crap...I guess you could try &quot;Enter The Unknown&quot;\
      \ in Race Mode. In this race, we just throw a ton of Super Meat World levels\
      \ at you randomly...so you don't know what you're going to get! Warning: This'll\
      \ probably be a mess the first couple of days until we get some solid moderation\
      \ down:)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH....umm...just wishlist\
      \ Super Meat Boy Forever and wait a bit???"
