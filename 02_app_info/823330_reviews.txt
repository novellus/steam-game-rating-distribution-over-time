It's visually wonderful with the dadaism style of art and the funky use of perspective. The art really fits in with the idea of a slowly collapsing society. I spent a good 5 minutes just appreciating the map and all the detail put in. I loved the look of the NPCs and all the textures, too. The sound design gave off a nice creepy vibe and I loved the wide variety of sound effects. The controls felt good and I'm very appreciative of the use of colliders on the obstacles. I was worried that because of the perspective, I would be hit by enemies/obstacles even if I wasn't really touching them but it was actually really easy and fun to maneuver through. The game is pretty solid when it comes to not having glitches/ places where you easily could get physically stuck which was nice. \n\nThere are some problems with the game though. The player is also a bit slow and since this game heavily relies on going back and forth from place to place, I would've loved a run button of some sorts. I also found myself getting stuck a few times because the objectives aren't really clear. One example of this was when I was trying to get the pieces of meat. There is one locked behind a door and the lady near it says that she lost the key. Because of this, I spent a long time looking for a key which I wasn't able to find. It turned out that I needed to use the skull and bones on the door which if I had never looked at the walkthrough, I wouldn't have known. I think in the Russian version they have clearer symbols, but the English version was heavily lacking. I want to mention that the weird ways of progressing wasn't an problem rather the lack of direction that I didn't enjoy. There is a playthrough that helps, but I think that these issues could be easily fixed with a few minor tweaks and additions. \n\nOverall a good game for a good price!","timestamp_created":1562737630,"timestamp_updated":1562737630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws/ua7esCcJ6CzgE="}
