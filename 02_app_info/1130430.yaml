    review: "Remember [i]The Shawshank Redemption[/i]? Remember when Andy Dufresne\
      \ had to develop photographic memory, master deduction, and figure out computer\
      \ and electrical systems? No? Remember when he traversed the sewers and had\
      \ to avoid a zombie while dicking around with valves and keys? Remember when\
      \ he learned the Warden\u2019s dirty secrets related to human experimentation\
      \ and dangerous chemicals because he handled all of their documents?\n\n[b][u]The\
      \ Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]It\u2019s an adventure game with escape room elements.\n\
      [*]Copying outside of the game and pasting into it works. It\u2019s like they\
      \ knew we would have to paste the same password 100 times.\n[*]I hope you\u2019\
      ve been eating your jellyfish, because you\u2019re going to have to use your\
      \ brain when playing this.\n[*]The visuals are interesting, to say the least.\
      \ It looks like someone took photographs of all the locations and drew over\
      \ them, but it works.\n[*]It still has horror elements, but not as much as the\
      \ first game.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Much like the\
      \ first game, there is only one musical track. Even though it\u2019s repetitive,\
      \ I was pretty numb to it through most of the game. I will say that it fits\
      \ and has an \u201CI must escape\u201D vibe.\n[*]When you die (yes, it\u2019\
      s an adventure game where you can die), you\u2019ll have to replay the level\
      \ from the beginning.\n[*]6 levels.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n\
      [*]The voices in the game are text-to-speech.\n[*]Like the first game, the translations\
      \ are strange (\u201CA overlooker at such a time not to call\u201D).\n[/list]\n\
      \n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Some of the clues in the game are randomized.\n\
      [*]Better write down everything you see; clues are all over the place.\n[*]The\
      \ door puzzle in the penultimate level is a bit finicky. Drag and drop the connectors\
      \ slightly to the right of the number you need.\n[/list]\n\nIn my review for\
      \ the first game in the series, I said it was bizarre in a number of ways, and\
      \ that remains true. The translations are still wacky, the visuals are the same\
      \ (with a modicum of animation thrown in), the soundtrack is limited, and the\
      \ dialogue is all text-to-speech\u2014yet I enjoy it. What does that say? It\
      \ says it\u2019s worth it. Get them both.\n"
