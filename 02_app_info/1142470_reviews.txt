This also applies to other songs although not as jarringly. Also I don't know what they did with the mixing for the soundtrack it seems worse than the files played directly out of the game directory. They have more depth but they sound a little off as in a little softer than the game files. I'd just recommend just format shifting the music from within the game files with audacity or the audio editor of your choice. these criticisms mostly surround boss theme 1 although it was the one I was most excited about having a high fidelity version, although some some songs are improved with the extra fidelity. I guess that comes down to personal taste but I would only suggest purchasing this soundtrack on the merits of supporting the devs and given this was my favorite game of the year I am in not salty about spending 5 extra bucks on what was a great value of a game.","timestamp_created":1606609188,"timestamp_updated":1606609188,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwytbXiPYCeLnttAI="}
