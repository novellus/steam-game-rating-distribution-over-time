Some of the stories are really captivating and a bit enjoyable.\n\n+ The game will challenge the player by giving no hints nor any kind of tips. There will be no tutorials on how to process an \"investigation.\" There is no map too. This 'encourages' the player to explore the world, and go through every nook and corner; because of this feature, the game 'can become' immersive and kindda fun too. Most of the puzzles are alright... BUT there was one particular puzzle that ruined the game for me as I will continue to discuss below. \n\n- The Vanishing of Ethan Carter gave off an early bad impression on me. The second puzzle (the one with the train tracks), which I encountered just a few minutes after starting the game, was frustrating. It tested my patience. I was stuck trying to solve it for an hour... I was going in circles, like a dog chasing its own tail,after spending too much time going back and forth on how to solve it, I finally cracked and resorted to using a guide. I usually don't use guides. I only resort to guides when the game isn't fun anymore or when it feels like the game is shoving feces down my throat. Using guides also makes me feel bad for spoiling the game, and also makes me feel bad knowing I had to use a guide because I'm apparently too stupid to solve the puzzle on my own. After going through the guide, I found out that the last piece of the puzzle was hiding in plain sight. This made me feel blind. I repeatedly went to that particular area, where the last piece was, and passed by it repeatedly before, but for some reason I wasn't able to spot it. I felt like I wasted my time walking around like a dumbass looking for something that's already in front me. I felt stupefied. I felt like I had a small brain. And the feeling latched on me throughout the game.\n\n- I don't know if it was because of the lingering unsettled feeling that I got after the second puzzle... But... I gotta say... I lost interest at some point in the game. I found myself not investing emotions on the characters. I didn't care where Ethan Carter was. The stuff I was doing in the game felt like just static background noise. Although there were some bits here and there that the game got interesting and captivating like the Lovecraftian story, and the final parts of the game, but overall, by the end of the game, I didn't feel anything... profound, or mind-boggling... it didn't have much of an impact on me. I tried to like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I really did. Sorry game but maybe you're just not for me.","timestamp_created":1610176834,"timestamp_updated":1610177593,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520231187343597412","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46oeE8/YCdPPewQI="}
