I'll try to click on a character and it wouldn't detect it, i would cast a spell and it wouldn't know it. However they happened on a rare basis. The game mechanics itself is pretty decent. The game itself does start out with hard difficulty though and when you play for the first time, you will see yourself repeating the first levels.\n\nOther than that, I enjoyed it enough to give it a thumbs up. 6/10\n\n- Rom","timestamp_created":1536018485,"timestamp_updated":1608276837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51140064001083374","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qKCxuvYCdo/9qQE="}
