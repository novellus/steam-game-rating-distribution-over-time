      \ with limited content."

    review: "Due to the lack of teleport or smooth locomotion, for a game so simple.\
      \ It's completely unplayable, to move I have to push a button, the screen goes\
      \ drunk blurry and you walk backward to move forward until you can't walk backward\
      \ anymore. Then you turn it on again walk backwards, let go and go forward..\
      \ \n\neither I'm doing something wrong or I simply don't have enough space for\
      \ this oversight of a locomotion system to work.\n\nI also think the game should\
      \ have a fun mode that just lets you go into a room with no timer and no score\
      \ and let you smash everything to your hearts content. Seems to be the point\
      \ of the game in the first place.. \n\nYou can't break china irl because breaking\
      \ stuff doesn't make sense irl or would bring trouble? Break everything in VR\
      \ and laugh like a manic the whole time without any repercussions. This is why\
      \ VR is awesome."
