    review: 'I play this game quite a short time passionately looking for what will
      be next and seeking for something usefull and meaningfull, but honestly I disapointed.
      It is really brilliant idea and it has great potential, but too monotone and
      boring in terms of game juice.


      It seems it has nice graphics, but somehow with killing poor performance. I
      think It has a deep optimization problem for such a small game that my cpu heat
      burst with not only low fps, but shaking vision and stammering voice time to
      time.


      I hope the developers update and progress what they''ve started, but for now,
      It is very very poor.'
