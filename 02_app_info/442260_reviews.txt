I am unable to play this with Keyboard nor Steam-Controller. Hitting the right Keys or pushing specific Controller-Buttons in the right time (whenever this might be) sounds not that hard, but because of the sluggish movement of the model and the distrubingly inaccurat positioning of the Model using the JoyStick of the Controller you have to start over and over again. I got really sick of this even during the intro which is suppose to help you to start. But I've got more and more angry about it and myself as well, so I've uninstalled. It's not worth my time.","timestamp_created":1505910363,"timestamp_updated":1505910363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t5LQz94CdafqhQE="}
