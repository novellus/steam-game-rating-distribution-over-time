    review: 'As much as I love the base game, I cannot recommend this DLC. the difficulty
      curve goes way beyond what you saw in the main game and you are constantly defending
      against attacks from all sides, It''s not uncommon to see 2 or 3 groups of heroes
      enter your dungeon within a 30 sec time frame. this took all the fun away from
      the actual dungeon building and forced me to constantly fight, which in the
      long run gets you killed due to the constantly ramping up heroes. No way to
      lower the difficulty either...

      Sadly a fail on the Dev team, at the very least let the ones who cry for bloodborne
      difficulty games tick the "hellish" box and have at it, don''t ruin it for the
      others who playing defensive, are more casual, or enjoy the base building aspect
      of the game.'
