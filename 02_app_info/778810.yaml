    review: "I am not very impressed about this story. There is the talk about the\
      \ ways for a split soul. But this game doesn't give you any options. There is\
      \ one part playing a depressed young man. But you don't play him. You can only\
      \ confirm playing a useless game on his laptop or talk to a very few npc's.\
      \ \nThe other is an old warrior with even less options. Oh, at last he can fight.\
      \ But the fights are boring.\nThere is just not enough to do in this 'game'.\
      \ Add that most npc's don't talk, that some conversations are not translated\
      \ and\nthat the end is very very bad (with a hint that they want to sell the\
      \ next part) and I can't recommend this 'game' even for the low price"
