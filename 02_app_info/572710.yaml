    reviews: "\u201CIf you\u2019re a fan of puzzle-solving and educational research\
      \ into another exotic culture, you won\u2019t mind getting lost for a while\
      \ in Nancy\u2019s Greek adventure.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/27732\"\

      \ dove into this title and, 10 straight hours later, came up for air with the\
      \ satisfaction of a mystery well and truly solved.  Nancy Drew: Labyrinth of\
      \ Lies is a game that cannot be missed by any fan of either the franchise, adventure\
      \ games, or simply of a good mystery.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://computertimes.com/LabyrinthofLies.html\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Computer Times</a><br><br>\u201COverall,\
      \ this was a solid addition to the Nancy Drew series. Diehard fans will be relieved\
      \ to see some recurring problems get addressed, and casual players will enjoy\
      \ the variety of puzzles and the characters that make this engine churn. If\
      \ you\u2019re a Greek history nut looking for an authentic experience of the\
      \ country, Labyrinth of Lies probably isn\u2019t for you, but it\u2019s a good\
      \ way to dip your toe in the water. This game won\u2019t become the stuff of\
      \ myths, but it\u2019s a worthy diversion.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://justadventure.com/index.php/2013-05-20-21-09-14/2379-nancy-drew-labyrinth-of-lies-review\"\

    review: I thought this was really fun and it had plenty of different "locations"
      to explore. For people who enjoy mythology, it was fun to see their interpretation
      of the stories as well! I will say, it didn't necessarily end on a high note,
      but the playthrough was good enough I'll give it a pass.
