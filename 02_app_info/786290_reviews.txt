It is thin, tame and predictable, with one-dimensional characters ever keen to speak the plot and ramifications of the choice system back to you. It is exceptionally short, and very few of the coordinates set at the beginning of the story change by the end. You are largely siphoned through a predetermined series of events in which you may succeed or fail, and as ever accomplish differently depending on the skill set you have chosen to develop. The scope of the story and its settings feel minute and – something that I find to be increasingly rare in COG productions – written from someone's bedroom, with scant knowledge of what, say, an opera house looks and feels like.\n\nIt is disheartening to see COG continue to produce, rather than merely host, games of this calibre. It simply ought to have transcended uninspiring cut-and-paste jobs such as this considering the number of better written, more imaginative, less painfully genre-bound titles it has been responsible for of late ('Tally Ho', 'Broadway 1849', 'The Superlatives: Aetherfall', to name three very recent games). \n\nThis would be forgivable if the price were lowered reasonably to reflect the game's length – I would be disappointed at paying any more than £2 for this fare, as it is good for nothing other than mindlessly passing an hour or so of your life, if you are so inclined. The replay value of Undercover Agent is nought, and this is apparent from the very beginning of this experience if you are reasonably familiar with COG games. It makes one wonder how many players are content to skip over text as a means of hoovering up achievements only available via multiple playthroughs. I would hope that the audience likely to drive the production of such games to the next level have higher standards than that.","timestamp_created":1518222434,"timestamp_updated":1595272374,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604624152183532715","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw75TptvMCcae6mAE="}
