    review: 'As you can see from how many hours I''ve spent on this game, I really
      enjoyed this for casual gaming. The premise is simple, you need to match up
      different coloured circular gems in order to get them off the board and to clear
      each level completely.


      The physics are nice, the gems move well and their weight affects the gems surrounding
      them. There are a lot of very tricky puzzles where you have to try to get a
      perfect score by matching special gems, and there is a good problem-solving
      element to all levels. It''s also very replayable as you struggle to get a perfect
      score n earlier levels which you initially just were thankful to complete in
      the first place.


      There are also special gems which allow you to eliminate more gems as you go
      along, including ''bombs'' which explode surrounding gems, ones which destroy
      a line, and others which destroy all of one colour.


      The bottomless pit level is one which makes you come back again and again as
      you try to beat the achievement (haven''t yet - so close!) and all in all it''s
      a great casual game with a good deal of variety.


      Oh and there''s some sort of story about mermaids so forgettable that I simply
      can''t remember it at all.'
