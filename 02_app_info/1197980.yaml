    review: "As a VGM collector/ripper for a long time and 1000+ on my hard drive\
      \ (not only rips; quite a few purchased) with the majority being games I'm very\
      \ fond of or enjoy the music of and not just collecting anything randomly\u2014\
      you better believe me when I tell you that this soundtrack  has become one of\
      \ my all time favorites and just oozes a very surreal unique vibe.\n\nI even\
      \ waited until the sale was over to buy it to show my full support to the composer.\
      \ As you can see on the tracklist below on the Steam store the day themes are\
      \ 10-18 minutes long each (not just looped a certain amount of times) and the\
      \ \"[i]Day One Suite[/i]\" will always have a special place in my heart. It's\
      \ as if I'm transcending into a new dimension of tranquility.\n\nThis one however\
      \ is also a favorite of mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX7nFGxjLTw"
