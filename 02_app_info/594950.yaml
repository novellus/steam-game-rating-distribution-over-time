    review: Super fun puzzle game - Adorable style, great story. I absolutely love
      the different elements in this game, like the sidequests and the cooking features.
      There is blood and quite a few ways to die, so if you're squeamish about that
      it might not be the best idea to play. However, even with the horror elements,
      this game is adorable
