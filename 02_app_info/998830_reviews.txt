I bought it on sale for 1,64 EUR and i wouldn't play it if i would be payed for it. Utter Garbage. Even calling it a terrible mobile game port would be an overstatement. There are not even Soundoptions in the game! Want to adjust general volume? ALT TAB to windows and adjust there please! Wanna tone Music down? Not today son! If anybody reads this, get Kingdom: New Lands instead, it has a similar style and is a proper (good!) game.","timestamp_created":1593354039,"timestamp_updated":1593354039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494699656963348389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47aXT/fICcKSFkQI="}
