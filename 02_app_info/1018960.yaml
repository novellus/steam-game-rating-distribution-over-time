    review: I would say that the game being in early access would make me go a little
      softer on the game as it still needs time to be made and the developer must
      be working hard to implement the new levels that they have envisioned for this
      game. You can imagine my surprise when this exact same developer has brought
      out SEVEN games (as of this review) out before giving any sort of major update
      to this game. The 20 levels that they promised? Not here. As for the graphics
      they look alright but do give off a sorta 'I bought a unity asset pack and thrown
      it into a blender with a plethora of other things I have bought.' vibe. I'm
      of course not accusing the dev of asset flipping but the quality of this game
      is giving off a lack of care like most 'asset flip' developers. The core gameplay
      is decent in some parts but dreadful in others. The ai are pretty dumb and easy
      to kill. This enemies in the first few levels will run as you without a care
      in the world, some even in a straight line! But when enemies get guns they seem
      to be able to have some sort of LMAOBOX hacks installed as even when you see
      the bullet whizz past you it still hits and takes health off. Other than that
      the game is just very boring and a redesign would be needed. Think of other
      settings, not just a road with loads of cars for cover and a few turns. Something
      like the inside of buildings or something along those lines would actually liven
      up the monotony of playing the exact same bare bones levels. I've played a lot
      worse on steam but I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state.
      I spent 57p on this and still feel a little ripped off.
