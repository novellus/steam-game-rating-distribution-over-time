    review: "This game has a good point it's trying to make but unfortunetly it falls\
      \ flat and comes off to me as an unrealistic portrayal. The only reason for\
      \ this is because we aren't given enough time to get to know the main character.\
      \ \n\nMy point is, everyone experiences anxiety in their life and whether it's\
      \ crippling or just something that you get from time to time is the important\
      \ part. Here it's impossible to tell if this is just a socially challenged adolescent\
      \ too baby to get out of their comfort zone or a person actually too worried\
      \ about the worst case scenario to function. Anxiety is too easily described\
      \ by other developmental challanges everyone goes through. This is why I am\
      \ so hung up on this very important distinction and I don't believe the game\
      \ does a good enough job of showing that difference.\n\nAs for the game itself.\
      \ Based on the theme and it's length there are few things to say. Not being\
      \ able to skip the timer sections was annoying. Because having to reset when\
      \ you fail and go through it all again was annoying. The way it plays out is\
      \ pretty much worst case scenario in every possible way except the decided right\
      \ way. It would have been nice to explore the anxiety and watch it play out\
      \ in more ways than just total meltdown or hurray I made oatmeal. Aside from\
      \ that because you already know your character is going to completely break\
      \ down if you don't choose the correct option it's not even fun to explore the\
      \ other options at all. In fact it kind of took any sympathy I might have had\
      \ for the character away. The game reinforces the idea that if a perfect scenario\
      \ doesn't play out for these types of people or if they ever feel uncomfortable\
      \ then they won't be able to function or have a mental break. This is just not\
      \ true and again for a heavy topic just exploring the way it makes you feel\
      \ and not how you live through it or deal with the difficulties when life doesn't\
      \ go your way again takes away any sympathy I was feeling because it's not a\
      \ good representation if you leave out those aspects.\n\nI enjoyed the first\
      \ 3 minutes. It had less substance than I thought it would and I just can't\
      \ recommend it for the reasons above.\n\n3/10"
