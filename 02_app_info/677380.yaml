    review: This is what its like a to work in a real club, just kidding. But it's
      kind of a funny VR game where you sort of have to read the crowd and play what
      they want, you'll see some people like it and some hate it. You can upgrade
      some of your items. Can you believe it's free, back I got this it was $6 on
      sale. Anyways if you have a VR it's a small distraction and a little fun. It's
      not a super long game but a quick one.
