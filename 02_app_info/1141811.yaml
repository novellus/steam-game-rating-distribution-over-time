    review: Even though base game is great and joyfull, this dlc doesn't do it for
      me. It's just to much of the same thing. You get 2 paintings that has only 4
      colors in it. Many others have so many repetitive arts. It's just feels like
      the artists get a bit lazy. But it's ok if you just wanna kill some time.
