If you really love these pixellated dungeon crawlers, then I'd recommend it, but everyone else would be okay to steer clear. The chief problem isn't the game's length, the utter predictability of monsters and combat, nor even the tendency of RNG to completely mess up a run-through, but rather the mechanics. Sometimes when firing a bow or magic, projectiles inexplicably miss. Sometimes I can't hit things in melee, but they just chop me down - and sometimes vice versa. The combat just doesn't work very well and doesn't provide a very enjoyable experience. \n\nWith a lot more work and streamlining, this could be all right.","timestamp_created":1609270141,"timestamp_updated":1609270141,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hLT+1/YCcZTFvgI="}
