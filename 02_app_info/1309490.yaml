      \ a new day comes, some random events will be triggered, requiring players to\
      \ make decisions. For example, if you are sick, is it allowed to rest? If you\
      \ choose yes, you cannot go to the mission today. Choosing otherwise will increase\
      \ the character's dissatisfaction value.<br>\xB7Plot events<br>Some plot events\
      \ will be triggered based on the player's behavior and the content of the missions\
      \ performed. This type of event will have many additional branch options that\
      \ last for several days, and different options will bring different results\
      \ (rewards).<br><strong>Mission system</strong><br>\xB7main mission<br>Every\
      \ time a new day comes, a mission will be drawn from the main mission pool to\
      \ the player. Players need to complete the main mission to advance the game\
      \ progress.<br>\xB7Rare mission<br>Rare missions are uncommon and missions that\
      \ require specific conditions to obtain. For example, you need to make specific\
      \ event choices; have a designated role; obtain specific props, etc. Rare missions\
      \ will give special rewards and achievements.<br><strong>Recruitment system</strong><br>\xB7\
      After coming to a new day or using recruitment items, you can recruit different\
      \ characters. Each character has a unique ability and personality.<br><strong>Building\
      \ and technology system</strong><br>\xB7Players can exchange special resource\
      \ items for buildings and technologies. These contents will not be lost due\
      \ to the failure of the game. With the accumulation of the number of games,\
      \ players can continuously unlock new contents and mechanisms to assist in the\
      \ progress of the game, and at the same time compensate the players for Frustration\
      \ after failure.<br><strong>Character system</strong><br>\xB7Different characters\
      \ have different personalities, which will have a certain impact on the game.\
      \ For example, some characters are prone to get angry, generate extra dissatisfaction\
      \ points, and finally trigger frequent resignation events.<br><strong>Small\
      \ game system</strong><br>\xB7Built-in various mini-games, when some special\
      \ events are triggered, players will be required to complete a set of randomly\
      \ generated number weaving challenges, and will receive additional rewards after\
      \ completion.<br><strong>Combat system</strong><br>\xB7The battle adopts a turn-based\
      \ war chess mode. Compared with traditional war chess, it simplifies many operational\
      \ logics, greatly speeds up the rhythm and unnecessary decision-making thinking,\
      \ and basically achieves the goal of being easy to learn and difficult to master.<br><i>Special\
      \ skill release mechanism</i><br>The release of skills is based on a set of\
      \ rune extraction mechanism. Each round the player will extract a certain number\
      \ of runes from the rune library. The skills that can be released by the character\
      \ will be determined by the type of rune extracted. The content of the rune\
      \ library is composed of the types of characters in the team.<br>This mechanism\
      \ can ensure that teams composed of different characters will have different\
      \ characteristics, and the same character will produce different effects in\
      \ different teams. In each round of the battle at the same time, players will\
      \ have different expectations of what they can release in the next round. In\
      \ order to avoid the boring feeling that the traditional war chess is just a\
      \ simple comparison of values \u200B\u200Bin the late stage.<br><i> Choose one\
      \ of three rewards/upgrade system</i><br>\xB7 Players can choose one of three\
      \ rewards/talents when they win and upgrade their characters.<br>The design\
      \ here uses a standard Rougelike mechanism to ensure that each game will have\
      \ a different experience and freshness.<br><i>Random map system</i><br>Currently,\
      \ a random map generation system is designed based on the wave function collapse\
      \ algorithm to ensure that players can explore different map routes every time\
      \ they set off."
