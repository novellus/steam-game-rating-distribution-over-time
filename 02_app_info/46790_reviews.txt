Combat is closer to MOO 3 without the broken AI. Graphics is closer to MOO 1 but without the charming pixels.\n\nThe game is Master of Orion watered down and that's all the positive things I can say about it.\n\nIf you have played any Master of Orion, you can continue playing them.\nIf you haven't played any Master of Orion. I don't know your frame of reference but it's safer to get a Master of Orion game than this watered down version.\n\nIf you can't get Master of Orion and crave Master of Orion, this game may still your hunger if you close your eyes really hard and let the Master of Orion soundtrack play through your head.","timestamp_created":1587887101,"timestamp_updated":1587887101,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xMrc2vECfaPIgwI="}
