    review: '[h1]Skip this![/h1]

      Not so good game as assumed. Tho you have a nice but simple character creator
      at the beginning of each round. But then the gameplay is boring and repetive
      (just 1 level). Dodging with slingshot moves. Each wall is eletrocuted and you
      have to "survive". There''s no depth in game, no purpose to play at all.'
