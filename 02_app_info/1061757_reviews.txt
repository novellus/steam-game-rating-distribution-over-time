Atelier Lydie and Suelle had two great DLC dungeons with new (well really from other Gust games) monsters and Bosses.  The items obtained from there and the enemies were worth farming and add so much options for end game gear.\nThis dungeon has none of that!  The monsters are just buffed versions already in the game and there's no new traits worth farming to put on your gear for your next game run!\nThere are new items/traits but all they do is increase quality while limiting one attribute to 0. There's one more that increases quantity made by 1.  But if you already reached this point and are already strong enough to beat the entrance boss, I seriously doubt you need these traits.","timestamp_created":1565396656,"timestamp_updated":1565396656,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66867673397064209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Ku6vOwCe++H0AE="}
