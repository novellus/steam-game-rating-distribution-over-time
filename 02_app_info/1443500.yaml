      \ Francis travels to the kingdom of Kassel with Iron Henry, the best soldier\
      \ in the land.  Iron Henry takes three iron bands around his heart protecting\

      \ Golden Orb, the treasure of the kingdom, to call for help.  Her elder sister\
      \ is clever and kind.  Her second sister is brave and beautiful.  They tell\

      \ does, she will have to marry him.  So Francis tricks her into accepting him\
      \ as her pet.  Then Francis shows he really is a prince, and explains she has\
      \ promised to let him in her room, so she will have to marry him.  And when\
      \ they\u2019re married, she will have to kiss him.  So she might as well kiss\

      \ the witch of the woods.<br><br>Filled with humour, strong characters, ethical\
      \ questions, poignant moments, and beautiful evocative music, Frog's Princess\
      \ is a story of which you can make dozens of versions.  Choose from 10 speeches\
      \ each time the prince and princess speak: traditional, idealistic, kind, charming,\
      \ artistic, intellectual, protective, fun, commanding, or peaceable.<br><br>When\
