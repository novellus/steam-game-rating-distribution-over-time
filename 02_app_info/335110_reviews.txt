It's quite interesting how developers kept on making stuff DLC for CM2, maybe it's more popular than I think, or maybe Crazy Machines Elements never got enough recognition, which would be shame.\n\nBut yes, it's another DLC aimed for sandbox players, who would find some good use for new elements. And many ones and zeroes.\nAs for puzzle players, there are 12 new puzzles, which is the most compared to other small DLCes that this game has. They aren't too hard, but at least they are up the standard, all working and having bonus objectives (of always wanting to have more \"party\"), with finely written info text. It's nice.","timestamp_created":1433003573,"timestamp_updated":1433003573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60145258903503418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48Ofq0s0Ceu2rPQ=="}
