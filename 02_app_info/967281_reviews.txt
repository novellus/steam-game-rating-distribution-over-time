It features a new safety cabin, better sound isolation and new electronics. The result is a powerful, modern locomotive which offers easy handling and a smooth ride. The engine sounds very civilized, providing a relaxed, comfortable in cab atmosphere, which is only disturbed by applying the harsh sounding horn (but there are 3 different horns available, depending on which loc number you drive). This also triggers the bell and the ditchlights, which can be reset pressing 'B' (2x) and Ctrl + L.\n\nIn other words: I like it!!\n","timestamp_created":1573307973,"timestamp_updated":1573307973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42M+dqO4CdMXq2AE="}
