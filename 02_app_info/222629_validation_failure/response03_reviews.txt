But if you load it along with the SD70 you would notice that the two do not match in height of platform or body. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the SD70 based off the same chassis as the SD60? If this is true, then one of these is scaled badly, but which one? I received the SD60 free, so I have no complaints to make, but advice to all type-A folks out there would be to not load both locos into the same scenario.","timestamp_created":1469887807,"timestamp_updated":1469887807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44f+IntYCcqLzXQ=="}
