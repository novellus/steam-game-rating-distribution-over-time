And oh yea the multi month crazy balancing cycle that they take extreme changes to the gameplay changing stuff for God only knows what cow sense they use.\n\nTaking weeks to months more to fix balances the broke in the new patch, which they then freak up again in a new extreme balancing pass that break old stuff or introduce new crap which they then take forever again to fix ...\n\nOh, not to mention that they NEVER have been able to deliver what they promise on time or meet expectations that they hype people up to have. Years of delays and delays and broken promises and more broken promises and more hype, etc.\n\nThis game have taken forever to get where it is. And it is true that it is better then at the start. But the road is filled with too many side steps, too many broken promises, too many bad balance cycles. And they took so so so so long, to get where they are which is not even close to what they promise across the years. \n\nAnd after so many years, it is bascially the same game with a bit more variety. Look at PoE, look at Elder Scrolls, Dreadnought, World of Tanks, etc. Across the years they become way more then their start. But MWO is still just an improved deathmatch game in which all the different mods are just thinny coatings to the deathmatch. After so many years you would expect way way more.\n\nTo conclude, it is just now worth it to play the game. Because sooner or later, they will freak with you and you will slowly and slowly die inside by death of a thousand cuts.\n\nI have play 600+ hours across the many years and have spend hundreds of dollars and I can no longer take the spiral that is MWO.","timestamp_created":1481728571,"timestamp_updated":1604937520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuOLu1vUCfKKYbA=="}
