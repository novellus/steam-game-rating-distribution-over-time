    developer_response: Thanks FastLawyer for your review. Firstly, we really enjoy
      your reviews and the dedication you show to reviewing so many VR games. It doesn't
      go unnoticed that you have a deep understanding and involvement in the VR community.  Appreciate
      your views on this game. Yes as you mentioned it probably does seem dated by
      todays standards since it was released in 2016 in very early days of VR.. (since
      it took 2 years to create from 2014 onward by one person). I would take that
      as a given. This was before motion controllers were even on the radar, systems
      for working with VR were changing daily and all manor of issues actually completing
      a game. Having said that, not making excuses as we would love to update this
      game in the future and plan to do so however it is not the main focus currently.
      All fine with your opinions on everything as that is your prerogative, it's
      pretty harsh based on 0.5 hours of a 8 hour game, but understandable also since
      you didn't like it. All good. The only thing not comfortable with is telling
      others to not buy it at all. Seems like a low blow. As a VR only game company
      you can imagine we make no money at all and work for free always. So the $4
      dollars you mention would have gone to paying a random license fee for unity
      for something else. So many VR developers are and have dropped out of perusing
      this awesome creative tech simply because they can't maintain even paying rent.
      So with that comment you help to contribute to that long list. I tip my hat
      to your sir. Please contact us at info@stonepunkstudios.com and I will personally
      refund your $4 and you keep to game. Because we are not in this to make money,
      just to explore the creative medium of VR. You didn't like this particular exploration
      and it's great you tell others also, I would not ever want anyone to be unhappy
      with a purchase.

    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nThis is one of the worst\
      \ platformers I have ever played in VR. I'm just surprised it has any positive\
      \ reviews. I was only able to play about 30 minutes before the game hard crashed\
      \ (had to restart Windows). I took that as a sign that I should quit and uninstall\
      \ this garbage. I don't even want to do a video review for this mess of a game.\n\
      \nFirst of all, it ran poorly on my 1060 GTX. Controls (gamepad) felt sluggish\
      \ to respond (motion controllers are only used at the hub menu to select items).\
      \ The rollergirls start out very slow from the gate. You feel like you're skating\
      \ on molasses. The visuals are dated with poor lighting and textures.\n\nThe\
      \ camera views are very poor. There's these parts where you ride vehicles. You're\
      \ in third person view in VR while riding these vehicles and your AI friends\
      \ obstruct your view. It's a simple game of Frogger during these portions of\
      \ the game. Collect cows (save them from aliens) and avoid getting hit. \n\n\
      The side scrolling is almost as bad. You have  a small field of view. You basically\
      \ switch in and out of the different roller girls to take down enemies. Freeze\
      \ it, switch and throw a missile at the alien enemies. There's some powerups\
      \ that increase your speed and some upgrades that make your weapon stronger.\
      \ Unfortunately, the game runs poorly, the controls aren't responsive enough,\
      \ and the environments and level design are dull and uninspired.\n\nThis honestly\
      \ feels like the quality of a 2013-15 free to play mobile game. It's running\
      \ on the Unity Engine. It looks & plays ugly. Scantily-clad women on roller\
      \ skates cannot save it.\n\n[b]Rate 3/10. Unfortunately, I bought this back\
      \ in a 2017 Steam sale for $4 USD and I didn't play it until now. Too late for\
      \ a refund, but don't make the same mistake I did. Do NOT buy this game. You've\
      \ been warned![/b]\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed reading my review. please consider\
