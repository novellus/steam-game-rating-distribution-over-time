The ending could've been a bit more speechy (melodramatic?), but getting there was not a grind.\nThere is scope for a couple of replays, depending on your dogfighting preferences.\nThere are some non-critical bugs to iron out, but nothing that destroyed game-play for me.\nThe story was good, the concept of modular ship-components was also something I like, and the map is not so large as to get bored going from A to B. (Having said that, though, there is scope for making this a much larger game-world (compare to [i]Elite: Dangerous[/i], or [i]No Man's Sky[/i]).\nA good game, in the end.","timestamp_created":1608962583,"timestamp_updated":1608962583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nZXpzvYCcIulvQI="}
