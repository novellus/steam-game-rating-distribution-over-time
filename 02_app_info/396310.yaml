    review: "[h1]Genre: Psychological Horror/Point&Click/Indie[/h1]\n\nBefore you\
      \ start the game it tells you how this game was based on true story. Usually\
      \ when this is said in movies or games it's not true. However I googled a bit,\
      \ and turns out that this indeed was based on the true story. Next part will\
      \ be spoiler, because I recommend reading this article only after you have finished\
      \ the game, because otherwise you will spoil yourself a lot of things. The story\
      \ of this game is based on the [spoiler]serial killer Hamliton \"Albert\" Fish\
      \ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish [/spoiler]  \n\nWhat is this game\
      \ about? This was taken from the store page so it's not a spoiler: \"A young\
      \ man discovers through a series of hallucinations that he will grow up to become\
      \ a violent psychopath. How will he respond to these revelations? Can he change\
      \ his fate? Can you even... change fate...\" You play as the youngest child\
      \ of some mentally ill family, which consists of masohistic brother, sadistic\
      \ father who beats you whenever he wants, and mother who blames you for everything\
      \ and keeps threatening you how your father will beat you. Everyone hates you\
      \ in this family. So what is your goal in this game? Your goal is to find what\
      \ is your fate and is there any way to change the fate, same as it was said\
      \ in the store page description. So can you change your fate, are there any\
      \ choices? No, you can't. And why is that? It's because as developer said in\
      \ one thread, how this game is based on real life story, so you are not supposed\
      \ to be able to change events of this story. You don't even get illusion of\
      \ choices in this game, it's clear to you that you will not be able to change\
      \ the fate and that you will become psychopath. How shocking! You are tortured\
      \ your whole life, and it's suprise that you become psychopath one day. No S_H_I_T\
      \ Sherlock. Basically like every psychopath ever. You can be terrible at statistics\
      \ and you will still be able to guess outcome of this game. I understand that\
      \ this story is interesting to developer cause he made this game based on this\
      \ real person, but if you dont know backstory its just not that interesting\
      \ unless you google it, but why would we be obliged to do so? Whole game you\
      \ are doing some stupid pointless tasks, listening to gibberish, and interracting\
      \ with disturbing people, really nothing interesting about story of this game.\
      \ \n\nGameplay is classic Point&Click gameplay. You click on items, you have\
      \ inventory, and you can use those items. Other than story and the gameplay,\
      \ characters look very ugly, but that was done on purpose. Game is very short,\
      \ around 2,3 hours long. It's also buggy game, 2 times I had to restart chapter\
      \ cause item disappeared from my inventory for no reason.  Atmosphere is non-existent\
      \ in my opinion, this game is soulless.\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1] This game is based\
      \ on real life story, and you can read about it here: [spoiler]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish\
      \ [/spoiler]  If you plan to buy the game, don't read this article before finishing\
      \ the game, otherwise you are free to read it, but it's just sick stuff. Story\
      \ is disturbing and not interesting at all, so in conclusion it's just disturbing,\
      \ it's a bit buggy game, and very short, around 2,3 hours. I feel like I wasted\
      \ my time playing this game. It's not a terrible game, but it doesn't offer\
      \ much. I don't recommend it.\n\n[i]Note: This explains how I rate games in\
      \ my reviews. https://imgur.com/gallery/z9ZjA47[/i]\n\n[h1]Personal rating:\
      \ 5/10[/h1]"
