    review: This is fun and cute; after having played through it a couple of times,
      I realise how much I wish the game was a little longer or had spawned a sequel.
      The mechanics are simple but endlessly varied and provide that wonderful feeling
      of enlightenment as you go from "This puzzle is impossible!" to "Ohhh... I get
      it!"
