    about_the_game: "Wildemist lsle is a exploration strategy card game.\_You are\
      \ a hero who's ship has crashed while sailing to the capital. You wake up on\
      \ this Island that has been covered in a mist for months, but the villagers\
      \ do not know whats causing it. Due to the protruding stones in the sea and\
      \ the razor sharp reef no ships can leave nor enter. So for you to get off this\
      \ island you must discover what is causing the mist and stop it. So you explore\
      \ the island doing quests for villagers, looking for treasure, solving puzzles\
      \ and fighting monsters when outside the village. Fights are a card game, your\
      \ deck of cards is based on your items you have equipped. You can get new items\
      \ by buying them at the marketplace defeating unique enemies or by exploration.\
      \ The damage you receive at the end of a fight stays with you unless you can\
      \ heal before the next fight, so don't stay out from the village too long or\
      \ you might not make it back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"\
