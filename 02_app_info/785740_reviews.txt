There shouldn't be any missions that fail when your cops get discovered, and the game should allow your cops to blaze through the criminals even when they are discovered (escape timers are reasonable though)\n\nOther then that, it's a great game!","timestamp_created":1609967510,"timestamp_updated":1609967510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn9Ti7PYCfKSOwQI="}
