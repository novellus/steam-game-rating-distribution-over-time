    review: 'Sorry but this game does not work properly. It has been rushed out and
      not tested. You can run off you goose off the map. The controls do not work.
      A traditional game controller does not work and it is practically unplayable
      even by keyboard. If you think you can simply remap your controller I am afraid
      you would be wrong as there is no option even presented.


      This game cannot be sold in its current state.'
