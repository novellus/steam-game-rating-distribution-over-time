Only caveat is the soul-crushing end-game filled with mazes that really yank you out of the story and turns the game into an endurance slog of stamina and will to keep playing.\n\nHowl of the Ravager is a prequel to the main game that reveals the back story of one of the playable characters in the main game, as well as revealing some hidden secrets of the nobility class. It plays exactly like the main game, minus the gear enhancing or party member switching since you only have three characters and two of them are Sword Bearers weilding two of the three legendary blades.\n\nThe writing is excellent, but the game itself falls way short of being a good vehicle for it. Art assets have a lot of clipping and flickering, world design completely fails the plot and story at the end. \n\nStill, I would recommend the DLC for the story, the revealed secrets, and to add a certain bittersweet enhancement to the main game. I only hope that the horrible, horrible end-game slog doesn't burn out potential players from playing the main game. This is just case study number one when it comes to excellent story-telling combining with a poorly developed vehicle to carry it.","timestamp_created":1589310861,"timestamp_updated":1589310861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47OWThfICdLeohwI="}
