Not a problem for an old-school adventurer, but a contemporary player could use a more detailed map with more warp points.\n- Some characters, like talking groundhogs, do not get in the overall picture well\n\nOverall, the game is a good, solid quest leaving very pleasant impressions. Good job Himalaya Studios!","timestamp_created":1513139315,"timestamp_updated":1548875749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561002373695373535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46IqM0OgCddj/kQE="}
