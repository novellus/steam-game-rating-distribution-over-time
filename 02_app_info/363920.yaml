    review: 'It''s an 80s-esque arcade platformer, just shy of being a MAME title
      or something. It even has the menu set up as an operator menu. It''s pretty
      solid, my only gripe is that some of the platforms can be a little deceptive
      about where they end (turning your double jump into a single jump to your death...),
      otherwise though, it''s a game you can play through in an afternoon. And you
      have to, as it has no save feature, only the ability to infinitely credit-feed.
      That said, it''s forgiving enough. Any levels longer than a few screens seem
      to silently checkpoint themselves, there''s no timer, and powerups are relatively
      frequent. The game changes tactics from world to world as well, so it doesn''t
      run the risk of repetition.


      I dig it. Well worth a pickup.'
