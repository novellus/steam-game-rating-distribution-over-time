Sometimes currently-dragged dice weirdly cancels being dragged and you involuntarily pick up another dice from the right-hand selection instead, other times one out of a group of dice or just a single die gets weirdly still-slightly-large and slightly-not-in-the-grid when put down, like the animation got suspended before it ends.\n\nstill fun, and what else would you expect. it has an endless mode though, and setting up combos there is super satisfying.","timestamp_created":1608806623,"timestamp_updated":1608806623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48ZyWyvYCdq7evAI="}
