    about_the_game: Sumo is a multiplayer physics-based party game for up to 4 players,
      where players use their wits, special abilities, and spherical physique to wrestle
      your human or AI opponents over the edge of irrationally hazardous Arenas. You
      have only one objective - Be the last sphere standing.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fast-Paced
      Action</h2><br>Each of Sumo's spherical combatants is deceptively maneuverable
      -- dashing and jumping to juke attacks and hazards alike. Do your best to snap
      up Boost Orbs to power up your devastating ability, before your round rivals
      do.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/858960/extras/steamskills5.gif?t=1572541190"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Unique Arenas</h2><br>Each Arena in Sumo offers creative
      ways to send your opponents careening off the edge. But beware, all Arenas continuously
      collapse, leaving only one player victorious. In Sumo, look forward to unceremonious
      ring-out by such things as:<br><br>Pressurized pipe-blasts of the WaterWorks!<br><br><img

    review: "Just not ready for prime-time playtime.  I feel that the game has potential......but\
      \ it crashed repeatedly forcing me into a hard reboot, and just was not worth\
      \ the effort.  So I returned it.   While I realize that the game is an early\
      \ release, there should be some basic standards before expecting people to drop\
      \ some cash down.  \n\nAs for the game: The best way I could describe the game\
      \ is a hybrid of \"marble madness warriors with King of the Hill\".  Knock the\
      \ others off the board and be the last one standing (or rolling).  The game\
      \ has some fun moments, and I think it has some creative aspects to try and\
      \ mix things up a bit.  It is fun to have four players rolling around which\
      \ can lead to some laughter.  The game can, however get a bit stale.  One suggestion\
      \ I have for the developers:  See if you can offer a mix of players \"powers\"\
      , so that players don't get fed up with the same old \"cheese move\" over and\
      \ over again.\n\nWhile I wish I could recommend this game, I just can't.  I\
      \ feel that until the developers hammer out the bugs a bit more, this game it\
      \ just not ready for the community."
