    about_the_game: <strong>Battle your way through the audio-verse.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">On-Rail
      Shooter</h2>Super Star Shooter 16 takes its cues from early arcade and 3d games.
      This means that player follows along a fixed course and is responsible for dodging
      obstacles and eliminating enemy targets. This results in a much more accessible
      game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Retro Graphics</h2>Super Star Shooter 16 achieves a
      unique graphics style by combining an extremely limited color palette with Unity's
      powerful 3d graphics engine. This game was inspired by MS-DOS gaming as well
      as the the 16 and 32-bit console eras.<h2 class="bb_tag">Psychedelic Audio-Visualization</h2>Super
      Star Shooter 16 synchronizes the audio and visual experience. The enemies and
      scenery in Super Star Shooter 16 all move to the beat of the music. This  often
      creates a sensation of calm focus or feeling &quot;in the zone&quot; during
      gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fun, Simplistic Gameplay and Controls</h2>Super
      Star Shooter 16 is intended for casual gamers. This game is intended to be very
      easy to get into, but difficult to master. The control scheme is very simple
      and does not take long to learn (or relearn).<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Discover
      a strange reality while flying through psychedelic simulation.
