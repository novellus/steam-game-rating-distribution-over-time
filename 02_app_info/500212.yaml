      \ from the 2-BIL EMUs of the Southern Railway, the 2-HAL fleet was built with\
      \ the purpose of populating the spate of newly-electrified main lines in Kent\
      \ \u2013 from London Victoria and Charing Cross to Gillingham and Maidstone.\
      \ The electrification project was monumental, and would transform the Chatham\

      \ today.<br><br>As the railways were modernised, engineers at Eastleigh and\
      \ Lancing Works began to produce a fleet of 76 brand new electric multiple units.\
      \ The on-order fleet for the Southern Railway was of similar specification to\
      \ the older 2-BIL, the most significant change was half as many toilets (Bi\u2013\
      Lavatory/Half Lavatory), however differences in construction lead to quite a\
      \ different aesthetic for the new units.<br><br>The construction of the 2-HALs\
      \ beat the electrification project, and so the new fleet was ran-in on the Southern\
      \ Railway\u2019s central section \u2013 running suburban services out of London\
      \ Victoria \u2013 until Kent\u2019s modernisation was complete. 2-HALs would\
      \ finally arrive in Kent, more specifically the Chatham Main Line, in July 1939,\
      \ and get to work on commuter services to Maidstone and Gillingham.<br><br>Services\
      \ formed of 2-HAL sets, typically in 8 or 10-car formation (8/10-HAL), would\
      \ depart London Victoria and split at the relocated Swanley station, with each\
      \ half bound for Gillingham and Maidstone respectively, before performing the\
      \ opposite operation on the journey back up to the capital. 2-HALs would also\

      \ and serving Gillingham and Maidstone out of London Charing Cross &amp; Cannon\
      \ Street.<br><br>Perhaps the most prestigious working that the 2-HALs partook\
      \ was long distance services from Gillingham to Portsmouth, these weekend excursions\
      \ were mainly put in place for naval personnel but could also accommodate regular\

    review: "This is a pretty well-modeled train.  The cab and passenger views are\
      \ nicely made.  The audio is recycled, but okay.  \n\nThere is a glaring issue\
      \ with this mod's second scenario \"a journey with Hal\".  The second signal\
      \ out of London Victoria is red when it really should be green.  Requesting\
      \ permission to move at danger is \"approved\" but it still results in a game\
      \ over which is very frustrating.  This gets more bothersome when you save at\
      \ that point and reload where the light changes to green even though it should've\
      \ been green all along.  \n\nTrain itself is alright, but the scenario as described\
      \ is not."
