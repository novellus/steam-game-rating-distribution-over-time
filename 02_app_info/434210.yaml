      \ a game that's short and sweet, the aesthetics have to be spot on, and they\
      \ are - the art design and direction is beautifully done, the narration good\
      \ and the musical integration is superb.  There's evidently a huge amount of\
      \ thought and effort gone into this, and if you have young children in the target\
      \ range, it will be well worth the nominal fee.   IT's a &quot;game&quot; designed\
      \ for a very specific group, and it does its job extremely well.\u201D<br><a\

      \ I don\u2019t think children would fully appreciate how wonderful it is when\
