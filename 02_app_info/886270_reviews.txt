It makes no attempt to build up atmosphere or tension and just hits you with goofy 3D clip art and a shooting section that ruins any immersion. And the \"puzzle\" section towards the end was bafflingly cryptic and a total waste of time. I spent forever tapping each key on my keyboard to figure out what each symbol represents and it turns out you're supposed to go on what they're shaped like? Like, what a five year old would do? The one bit of \"mythology\" they came up with was kinda interesting but I could find that stuff on r/creepypasta for way less effort. If you really love FMV games I guess you could do worse, otherwise it's not worth the one hour I spent on it.","timestamp_created":1588139645,"timestamp_updated":1588139645,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hPuf4vECeuGehAI="}
