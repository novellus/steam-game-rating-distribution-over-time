    review: 'This game is like a D&D campaign you dont need to write. This is a great
      game. needs a map though.



      edit after finishing the game:

      HOLY SHIT FUCK BALLS the story is fucking killer overall and the absolute CLIFF
      HANGER they leave you on. I am SO SAD that this game didn''t get enough support
      and thus will most likely never be completed. I just have to thank the devs
      for being able to put this great game together. This is a revolutionary game
      that should have changed the industry. I would gladly pay another 5-10 bucks
      for this game. Once again, I am legit sad that this game will most likely never
      see it''s conclusion (AND ILL NEVER FUCKING GET TO LEVEL 10), but that does
      not impact my recommendation. This game is well worth the price. '
