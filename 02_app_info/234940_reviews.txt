It is enjoyable, but be aware that it is primarily a visual novel with lots of narration and voice acting (although there are still blocks of text that are not voiced). There are some stylized animated segments, but most of the graphics are stills (usually with a digitally painted style) that fade, pan, and zoom in sequence. \n\nThe player has a lot of control over the the pace of the story sequences, but there is no fast forward button or rewind button for some sequences. There are limited elements of a hidden object type game that is usually easy, but on occasion the player might click on the object that triggers a change in scene before everything was fully explored. It is easy to get all of the achievements though. \n\nI did find a few voice acted sequences in the middle chapters that had voice sequences initiating twice, making a slightly annoying echo effect, in what must have been an unintentional bug (at least on my install). I cannot fault the presentation as a whole - the voice acting is superb, the visuals / music / sound create an aura of suspense, and the fluff text of newspapers draw the reader into a sense of belonging to the period. Overall good, atmospheric, exciting.","timestamp_created":1609820499,"timestamp_updated":1609820499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w+2x6PYCe9DMwAI="}
