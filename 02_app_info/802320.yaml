    review: 'More Appnori greatness. :)  The greatness in this game doesn''t really
      shine until you find yourself playing against the Terminator robot with a stop
      sign as your racket.  That being said the game isn''t without it''s flaws.  The
      AI is too easy.  I beat all 5 AI opponents in one hour.


      You can put a ridiculous amount of spin on the ball, and the killer feature
      is the signature Appnori bullet time where you ram it down their throat just
      at the right moment.  If I''m gonna pick any tennis game to play casually it
      would probably be this one just for the bullet time feature.

      Now that I''ve beat the AI I still find myself coming back just to show off
      with spin and bullet time.


      If you''re not serious tennis player.. this game probably has the highest fun
      factor out of the 3 I own.  Virtual Sports is still the best overall due to
      the challenging AI and progression.


      This game is still a buy.  price is a little high. $5.99 would be perfect but
      unfortunately these games never go on sale.'
