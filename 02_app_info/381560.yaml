    review: I think this game is great! The more time you put into it the better your
      decks can become. You get daily rewards for the first month only, but there
      are other ways to earn rewards. Campaign is an easy way to level up in the beginning
      and gain gold. This is better than Hearthstone in my opinion because when you
      buy diamonds to get other cards  for some of them you are guaranteed a legendary
      or epic. Heathstone only gives you a rare or better card no matter what card
      pack you purchase, mostly rares are what you get. Also in this game you can
      level up every card in the game by dust. This can increase their attack ad defense
      as well as their hit points and as with spells can make them do more damage
      or heal you better or protect your cards better. Yes I put money into this game
      to help me get better cards, but people did that in hearthstone too. The cards
      are better in this game than hearthstone. Hearthstone you got to pay for your
      story line or campaign quests. In this game it is all available to you as you
      reach the right level for that area. And in this game You get rewards for  completing
      easy, normal & hard modes. In Heartstone you don't get any reward for for completing
      quests in hard mode. This game should be at least tried for 30 days so you get
      all your daily rewards For being a new comer. I can't say for certain if this
      game is f2p or p2w because I am investing my money in this game and I think
      it is better to pay for stuff in this game than others especially hearthstone.
      I stopped playing Hearthstone when I tried this game out. I did not pay for
      anything up to level 25. In this game you can join a guild or if you have enough
      gold make your own guild.. And you can stay in that guild as long as you want
      to if you keep active in the game. I do both campaign and pvp. I was winning
      more than I was losing before I paid for anything. It is cheaper to level up
      1 star cards than 2, 3, 4 or 5. And also the higher the level your card is the
      more dust it costs. After 30 days if you still don't think it's worth your time
      than that's your opinion and not mine. I plan on putting my time and spare money
      in this game because I think it's worth my time and money more than any other
      card game. I can now have upto 10 decks saved.. You only have upto 6 cards in
      a deck and in hearthstone you have 30. But it is harder to win in Herathstone
      than Epic Cards battles. Hearthstone relies on luck to win, having the right
      card at the right time. In this game you can win with 1 star cards as often
      as you can win with 4 or 5 star cards. And most cards can be bought with gold
      which is easier to get than in hearthstone. In Hearthstone you get 10 gold for
      every 3 wins. In this game you get more gold and every time you win you get
      gold and alot more experience.
