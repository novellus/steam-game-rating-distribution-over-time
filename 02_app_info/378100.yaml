    review: "your text here...the fact that I paid money for this is a real bummer.\
      \ the entire time it feels like the main character is just trudging along out\
      \ of pure disdain for being in this game. almost more than I do for playing\
      \ it through. The character cntrols like a tank with the armor of paper airplane.\
      \ \n\nThere are some spots that will kill you instantly or easily, making you\
      \ start all over from the begining. this is a terrible way to make the game\
      \ \"longer\" but I guess it worked. The \"needing more batteries shtick is tired\
      \ as hell. could you imagine having a flashlight that lasted for 5 minutes before\
      \ you needed new batteries? it is just a dumb game mechanic. \n\nThe story of\
      \ this atrocity is almost none existent. some guy made things dark. . . dunno\
      \ how. . . dunno why. . . but. . . ya, the main bad was thwarted by flipping\
      \ the \"on/off\" switch on a telephone pole. of course, you have to go through\
      \ a black hole to get to . . . somewhere. . . where the main bad is. . . . and.\
      \ . . well. . . he is VERY black. . . like. . . the color though. the whole\
      \ thing just looks feels and tastes awful."
