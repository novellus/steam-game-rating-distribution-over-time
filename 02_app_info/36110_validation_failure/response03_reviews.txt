The game follows you, one man fleet, as you sail across the Caribbean trading and blasting your way through pirates and strongholds for riches and upgrades.\n\nThe progression becomes very quickly messed up as you get enough Tiki bombs to blast everything out of the water, but the nostalgia alone makes the game enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1608687701,"timestamp_updated":1608687701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wMnQxvYCf62pvAI="}
