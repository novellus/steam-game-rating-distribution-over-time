    about_the_game: "In Climb, you take control of a semi aware ball whose sole purpose\
      \ is to reach the glowing objective at the end of each level. The idea is simple,\
      \ but the physics present unforeseen challenges. After the learning curve, you'll\
      \ take on increasingly challenging levels across multiple stages. Each stage\
      \ is unique in theme and contains multiple levels. Start with the tutorial to\
      \ learn the controls, and then you\u2019re off! Replay the levels to beat your\
      \ high score. Take on one challenge after another and try not to get frustrated\
      \ in the process. The first stage is \u201CThe Basics\u201D. There are ten levels\
      \ to challenge you and many ways to reach the end. Then comes the next stage,\
      \ \u201CLight Out\u201D, which will challenge your ability to navigate the environment\
      \ when light becomes a more valuable resource. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs my first\
      \ ever game I\u2019m not sure how to present it other than to say that I enjoy\
      \ it and my friends say it\u2019s great."

    short_description: Climb is a relatively simple obstacle course game, in which
      you control a ball. However, the physics have been tweaked to make it more interesting.
      Most likely falling under the category of simple but aggravating, this game
      will have you repeatedly clicking restart in an attempt to score better.
