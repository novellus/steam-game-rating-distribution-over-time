Cool name, I'll be grading using references to steak.\n\n[h1] Auto-Staccato: A Review [/h1]\n\n[b]I will be touching on (and subsequently grading):[/b]\n     - Audio\n     - Graphics\n     - Gameplay\n     - Soundtrack\n     - Aesthetic Sensibility\n     - Final Rating\n\n[h1] Audio [/h1]\n\n[i] The Difference Between Medium And Medium Well Is Imperceptible, But Not The Difference Between Rare and Well Done [/i]\n\nMy personal opinion on the audio quality of this game is this; I have no qualms with it. It works fine for me, and while it doesn't go above and beyond, it does do its job efficiently as any game ought to. There is a review on this page, however, that states that the audio is a LOT better if you use lossless audio files. This means no mp3s, more like .wav files (from my knowledge on lossy vs. lossless, anyway). I do not, and have no intention of, going out of my way to get lossless audio files. I barely even know how to make my own audio files (something I should do someday). So do your own experiments. Audio gets a 5/5 from me, doubly so if I finally decide to play something lossless. As for the game's own soundtrack, I'll cover that in its own separate section.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\n[i] Very Well Done Steak! Or Should I Say Rare Because That's The Best Type Of Steak And I'll Fight Anyone On This [/i]\n\nGraphically, the game looks amazing. While I'm playing through levels, I really feel as if they took a lot of extra time on graphics and lighting and making the game look marketable. That aspect of the development will (say it with me kids) be important later. They did scrimp on some parts, however. The Tavern map is missing something; the actual level. The enemies are there, and so are the candles that light up the place, but everything else is pitch black. [i] Huh? [/i] Why is this? It doesn't affect gameplay at all (I can still play the game normally), but this game tends to hinge more on looks than usability, so sadly I can't let this one slide. The Forest and Tomb levels are highlights here; they look insanely well done, and I commend the devs for doing a great job there. Field is a bit of a hit or miss in terms of visibility; you can't really tell when you need to hit enemies (I'll touch on this in Gameplay). I'm also commending the work done on Meadow, it's very calming to blow hellhounds (I'm assuming) to bloody shreds and bits. If you buy this game, do try out all the maps! Graphics is 4.5/5 due to the issues in Tavern and Field (at least, for me. Not sure if anyone else has these issues).\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\n[i] Beef Jerky [/i]\n\nGameplay is very much a hit or miss. It all depends on what you really enjoy.\n\nThere are two gamemodes to this game; Horde and Arena. Horde is pretty straightforward; you get three lanes, enemies approach you through these lanes and you have to slice through them when they hit the certain areas the game has very kindly highlighted for us. It is HIGHLY difficult, as if you miss by even a [i] tiny fraction [/i] of a second, you lose health. You also lose health if you swing with no one in the highlighted areas. For someone who is easily panicked and somewhat twitchy, this adds to the difficulty level tenfold. You can choose to add two more lanes, or even add Colors. The Colors option is very redundant. I don't know why they added it. I don't even know how it works. It adds a little color map in the bottom right corner of your Arrow Keys, each one color coded (Up = Red, Left = Green, Down = Blue, and Right = Yellow. I don't know, Right always seemed more like a Blue color to me). It also color codes the ring around the enemies (used to time when they are in the highlighted area). But I can't figure it out. Do you need to hit both the arrow keys AND the keys binded to swing at the same time?? That seems even more insanely difficult, if it actually worked, because I'm hitting both keys at the same time and it doesn't seem to be working. There is also the issue with the Field map, in that the grass is wayyyy too tall. I have trouble seeing the highlighted areas, and can't even see the enemy rings, so it's useless trying to hit anything without losing health. And you lose it very quickly in this game.\n\nArena is also straightforward. You are placed in first-person view (as opposed to Horde which is in an above-angled third person) and you fight what I'm assuming are hellhounds. They certainly look like they were ripped from DOOM, though I've never played so I wouldn't know. You have horizontal lines moving towards the left of your screen; these are the beats that you synchronize your attacks with. You attack by SHOOTING FREAKING LIGHTNING OUT OF YOUR HANDS WHICH IS MAD COOL. No more swing-your-swords and firing-a-bow-from-horseback nonsense of Horde; we are straight up playing as Zeus here. The hellhounds, however, are somewhat imbalanced and disadvantage a twitchy, easily spooked person like me. The hellhounds make absolutely no noise, so in a situation where I am fighting 5-6 hellhounds in an already cramped Arena map, and I'm panicking internally and missing beats left and right, and [b] I CAN'T SEE THE 7TH ONE RUNNING AT ME FROM BEHIND, AND I LOSE MORE HEALTH, AND IT'S A VERY TENSE, UNFAIR AND STRESSFUL SITUATION. [/b] Now, if you aren't panicky, and can keep calm here, and don't mind being put at a disadvantage and only hearing the sounds of your own lightning, I'd say you are insane. But whatever floats your boat.\n\nI think you can already tell how intense this game gets for me in Arena mode. In Horde mode, it's less panicky (as I'm decent) but I still have my moments.\n\nI find the game imbalanced in Arena mode (come on, at least squeak, you dogs from hell, at least let me know you're coming it's unfair), while Horde is difficult but doesn't detract from the quality of the game, in my opinion. Other players who would rather have it easier may say otherwise.\n\nAlso, while I didn't touch on this earlier, there is apparently a Campaign to this game. I'll have to play through it later and edit my review accordingly.\n\nHorde: 4/5\nArena: 3/5\nIntensity: 5/5\nBalance: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Gameplay Rating (rounded to nearest whole number): 4/5\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\n\n[i] Basically Kobe Beef. Grade A 100% Natural Beef [/i]\n\nI've been sitting here listening to the main menu song loop over and over again. Coupled with the tracks that play when you win and when you lose, the few original songs that this game has to offer do not disappoint. I won't talk about this long, but do have a listen to it when you get the chance. 5/5 really good compositions. Please do not ruin it for me if it turns out they bought these songs or they're copyright free and published somewhere else. I will cry.\n\n[h1] Aesthetic Sensibility [/h1]\n\n[i] A Slab Of Beef Fit For Royalty [/i]\n\nThe game's aesthetic focuses heavily on the ideal medieval fantasy. The menu looks absolutely stunning (although I do not recall there being modern lighthouses in medieval times OR fantasy. I'll give them half credit for it though, it looks really well made). Some levels do make you feel as if you were in medieval times. The only exception to this may be Desert, unless you wanted to channel your inner Crusader, and Meadow, because medieval times did not look THAT dreamlike. It looks like something I'd see on PBS Kids ten or so years ago. Certainly has that aesthetic. I guess I have to admit that the game does lighten up its hold on aesthetic a bit, but I love the way it looks so much, I don't really mind. Still have to be reasonable, however. 4.5/5 to me because it matters, but it probably won't for the rest of you.\n\n[h1] Final Rating [/h1]\n\n[i] Overall, A Superb Look, But Watch Out For Difficulty And Gameplay [/i]\n\nAveraging up the scores gives us a Final Rating of 4.6. Personally, I wouldn't revisit, but 10 bucks isn't a bad deal!
