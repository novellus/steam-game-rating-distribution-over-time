The map here is much smaller and less interesting with few tactical placements compared to the Normandy map. I played the Israeli campaign one time and had no problem to win a decisive victory over the Arabs. They where pretty passive in the late part of the game and I didnÂ´t feel any tension or worries of the outcome. I bought this on sale for less than 6 euro but I would actually not recommend it even for that. I do however recommend you to check out the Normandy version which gave me much more enjoyment despite that the rules are pretty much the same. But I feel like the A.I in normandy was even better.","timestamp_created":1609003695,"timestamp_updated":1609003695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uf+F0PYCeP+5vQI="}
