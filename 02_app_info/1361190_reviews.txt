Controls might need to be changed upon startup (like Q was automatically left instead of A, for me at least).  Controls are then easy to follow and once you get an idea of combos against enemies, then they become very manageable.  \n\nAlso this game took me a lot longer than I think it would for most people just because I am not well-versed in platformers or games period, so don't be discouraged by how long I spent on it xD\n\nFor Hyde's first game, this is wonderful, and I'd definitely recommend.","timestamp_created":1603729339,"timestamp_updated":1603729339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p/btsvUCeJqjqgI="}
