      \ and brawls between mile-long capital ships, all the way through armored assaults\

      \ of a pianist for silent movies, Ed always knew that he wanted to tell stories\
      \ with music. As a small child he would exasperate violin and piano teachers\
      \ by composing &quot;stories&quot; and creating &quot;characters&quot; at the\
      \ piano in preference to performing his set study pieces. Finally, as a young\
      \ teenager, he found a kindred spirit in virtuoso jazz pianist and teacher,\
      \ Andrea Vicari, who encouraged his compositional narratives.<br><br>Graduating\
      \ from the British Recording Industry Trust (BRIT) School of Performing Arts\
      \ - often compared to New York's LaGuardia &quot;fame&quot; school and whose\
      \ fellow alumnus include Amy Winehouse, Adele, Imogen Heap, Katie Melua and\
      \ Leona Lewis - Ed went on to attend the University of Sussex. Here he studied\
      \ composition, orchestration and musical dramaturgy with English National Opera\
      \ composer, Martin Butler.<br><br>After a short stint playing session guitar\
      \ for Andrew Lloyd Webber, Dame Kiri Tekanewa and Boyzone; at only 22 Ed scored\

      \ and Paris Hilton. Soon after he began regularly visiting Los Angeles to collaborate\
      \ with film makers there.<br><br>In 2006, Ed was selected for a BBC New Talent\
      \ TV Composer Masterclass with BAFTA winner, George Fenton. A year later, he\
      \ was selected from a worldwide pool of candidates and flown to Los Angeles\
      \ by Warner Bros. for a Turner Classic Movies Young Film Composer of the Year\
      \ Award adjudicated by a blue ribbon panel of judges chaired by Oscar winning\
      \ composer Hans Zimmer. <br><br>Recently, Ed was part of the team nominated\
