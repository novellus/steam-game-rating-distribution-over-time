    about_the_game: "The \u2018ugly duckling\u2019 of Southern steam is now here for\
      \ Train Simulator, brought to you by Victory Works.<br><br>World War II halted\
      \ production of steam locomotives in the UK, but a large increase in goods traffic\
      \ across the country forced a shortage of suitable motive power for the Southern\
      \ Railway. The dated Q Class was seen as an obvious, but the SR\u2019s Chief\
      \ Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid, decided a new class of 0-6-0 steam locomotives\
      \ was a much better replacement, using minimal resources due to wartime austerity\
      \ and to reduce weight.<br><br>Built by SR\u2019s Brighton and Ashford Works,\
      \ the Q1 Class\u2019 unique design saw it labelled with some less than favourable\
      \ nicknames, however its lightweight construction meant it could operate across\
      \ the majority of the Southern network, and it was even used occasionally on\
      \ passenger services. The Q1 Class adequately met the Southern Railway\u2019\
      s wartime requirements and many of the Class continued into the post-war BR\
      \ era, working over the Southern Region until the end of steam in the mid-1960s.<br><br>All\
      \ but one of the Class were scrapped; the first locomotive built in the Class\
      \ was preserved and ran until 2004 at the Bluebell Railway in West Sussex. It\
      \ can now be seen on static display at the National Railway Museum in York,\
      \ England.<br><br>The Bulleid Q1 Class for Train Simulator is available in Southern\
      \ and BR liveries, with pre- and post-1956 BR logos. Extensive detailing of\
      \ the model includes three driving modes, dynamic numbering  including optional\
      \ fittings for all members of the class, multiple cab views, fully modelled\
      \ and animated Stephenson\u2019s Gear, realistic wheel slip physic and effects,\
      \ cylinder cock management, realistic injector control, fully controllable steam\
      \ sander, working tender controls and dynamic head disc/lamp settings.<br><br>Also\
      \ included are a selection of World War II era wagons, including SR single conflats\
      \ with containers, SR double conflats with loads including Spitfire fuselage,\
      \ gun barrels, tree trunks and planks, Howitzer Railgun and SR Warwell with\
      \ Cromwell tank.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving\
      \ you the freedom to drive the Bulleid Q1 Class on any Quick Drive enabled route\

    review: "I've owned this train for only a few hours and I've driven it twice but\
      \ I can already tell that it'll likely become one of my favourites in Train\
      \ Simulator. It's also liable to be a good introduction to steam power, a field\
      \ I'd avoided almost entirely until now, partly out of fear, and partly out\
      \ of not having had the money. Now that I (more or less) own the vast majority\
      \ of all other stock which interests me (aside from a handful of British routes),\
      \ I think I could bear to have a couple steam routes and stock to spare. So,\
      \ I picked both this and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway up from the March\
      \ Madness sale. \n\nI'm utterly blown away. This train is...let me explain.\
      \ I come from flight sims. They're sort of primarily what I do, more or less.\
      \ My primary occupation. Within them, I like to fly a VAST assortment of aircraft,\
      \ but I got my start flying warbirds, mostly those from the Second World War.\
      \ Whereas a contemporary or even Cold War aircraft will not tell you what's\
      \ happening but will rather indicate it, a warbird will tell you by *feel.*\
      \ For example, if you get hit in an A-10C, you'll have a row of lights telling\
      \ you, more or less, what's wrong. Sure, you'll have to adapt your handling\
      \ of the airframe (provided it's still airworthy) to the consequences of either\
      \ poor luck or poor decision making, but you've some informational foundation\
      \ on WHY you're experiencing what you're experiencing. In a warbird...you don't\
      \ get that. You get raked with a crop of gunfire. Your engine seizes. You've\
      \ a few seconds to maybe a minute to figure out a series of extremely mechanical\
      \ controls. You restart it. You get it to work, but...it *sounds* wrong, it\
      \ *feels* wrong. And just like that, by being one with the machine you're flying\
      \ rather than it being an interface you interact with, you're able to feel your\
      \ way through and forward. \n\nThe Bulleid Q1 is just like that. It's exactly\
      \ like that, in fact. It's a sensory experience, of slowly, deliberately incrementing\
      \ a series of reasoned parameters based on an assortment of guidelines in order\
      \ to achieve an end result. For the most part, the percentages on the HUD are\
      \ meaningless. You've to listen, to feel, to experience the engine to get what\
      \ you're after. It'll try to kill you, initially. All good machines worthy our\
      \ respect do - and when you tame it, you'll know. She'll basically tell you.\
      \ And I know that, to probably a fair few people reading this, that sounds insanely\
      \ pretentious and probably a wee on the mystical horseshit side. But seriously,\
      \ try it. If not in this, then in a warbird in IL-2. \n\nI will say this: One\
      \ and a half hours in, and this is a several-day job to master, with a few weeks\
      \ tacked on for us who are steam-challenged. So be ready for that. She's detailed,\
      \ she's noisy, she's loud, and she's temperamental. The manual is sizeable.\
      \ But...be ready for a great deal of autodidactic learning. \n\n9/10, worth\
      \ the dosh. Bloody good job, lads."
