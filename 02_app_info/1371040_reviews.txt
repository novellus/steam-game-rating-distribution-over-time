I hope that it's really the case, because I really, really want more out of this. Everything's set up for it - the story just needs to be written.\n\nAbout the game itself, I had a lot of fun, albeit within a short time. I'm not really good with solving mysteries and usually rely on walkthroughs to give me hints, but this is one where I told myself that I shouldn't use a walkthrough and try my best to find out for myself where I went wrong. And it's satisfying to finally reach the point where the player is told that everything had been done perfectly.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game for someone new to visual novels to ease into visual novels with mystery plots, but this is also one that will surely leave the player wanting for a lot, lot more.","timestamp_created":1609268999,"timestamp_updated":1609268999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tYb61/YCe7vEvgI="}
