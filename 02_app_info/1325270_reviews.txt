Not everything is being saved, when I load a saved game at the drone pad I ended up trapped there because the code for the gate was no longer entered. All audio in the game is not working for me, but I have seen videos where there is audio. Hoping it'll be corrected by removing and reinstalling, it is a pretty cool game despite these issues and I would like to finish it.","timestamp_created":1609301585,"timestamp_updated":1609301585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609344452,"developer_response":"Hello karmaverse,\n\nIf you find bugs, please send any details you can provide to support@sonoma.games so I can try to replicate and fix.\n\nThanks,\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4xq322PYCc5jVvgI="}
