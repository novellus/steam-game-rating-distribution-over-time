If You had to buy one of the earlier games I've reviewed then I'd \"beauty bounce\" would be the best choice. It's still just some random dude opinion but the art style in all the early games from this series (I've seen 2020 games have a little better art style) and the stories in these games aren't really great either. The only reasons I'd recommend buying this game is for easy achievements or anime backgrounds other than that I'd say don't waste Your money. If You really want to then buy it on a sale.","timestamp_created":1609577585,"timestamp_updated":1609577585,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lpuT4fYCfYjVvwI="}
