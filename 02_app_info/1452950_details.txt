I'm using a streaming tv series script that I've been writing and working on since 2008 (and continue to do so) as the base story for the entire Seditionis franchise.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI certainly hope you will get value out of this game as I continue to embark on what I hope will be a fun and meaningful video game career. I've been wanting this for a long time and I just can't wait for all the lights to turn &quot;green&quot;. If you like this game, please review it and consider purchasing the music soundtrack DLC to help support my next game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere will be big plans for sure, but one step at a time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour progress is auto saved every time you earn or spend perk point upgrades and purchase perks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMac\/Linux users note: I don't have a mac or linux machine but this game was built and compiled using Unity v2019.4.1f1.
