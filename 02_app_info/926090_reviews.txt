If you like the fantasy genre at all, this one should be in your collection. And there is even an extra mini-bonus chapter after the extended bonus chapter!\n\nPros:\n- good story (nothing new, but well crafted with enough going on to stay interesting)\n- nice art and music\n- excellent length\n- varied puzzles that go beyond the usual HOPA offerings\n- the right number of HO scenes\n- nice bonus chapter (more of the same, but good length and done well)\n- bonus scene with its own puzzles and HO scene if you find all 176 collectible leaves (um, yes, that's one hundred and seventy-six)\n- clear indicator for number of collectible leaves left in scene\n\nCons:\n- 176 leaves to find (4 per scene) (and they phase in and out)\n- the map indicators for scenes with actions were unreliable in the bonus chapter (but you probably don't need them)\n- not quite perfect resolution for wide screens\n- a fair bit of back and forth, but usually within a reasonable area (and you can use the map)\n- puzzles could sometimes use better explanations\n\nNeutral: some HO scenes are used more than once; I don't mind this, but I know it can be an irritant for others\n\nDon't most of us wish we could travel through mirrors to different worlds and own an awesome owl companion?\nThis game was a 9/10 for me.","timestamp_created":1597388364,"timestamp_updated":1597388539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612060964107513428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x9jx9fMCee6smwI="}
