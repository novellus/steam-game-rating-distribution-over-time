    review: "While running through the free card games on steam, I stumbled across\
      \ Hidden Dimensions 3. Since it was a SciFi themed game, it immediately skipped\
      \ to the top of my playlist.\n\nThen I was stuck in an absolutely tiny window\
      \ reading an excessive amount of text in the tutorial because I couldn\u2019\
      t adjust the resolution once the tutorial began. I admit, that soured me on\
      \ the game. \n\nAs for the tutorial itself, it was thorough and explained things\
      \ fairly well, BUT it didn\u2019t feel like I learned how to truly play since\
      \ I was simply told the rules and told what to play when. The tutorial is both\
      \ very good and not a proper introduction to playing.\n\nGiving the game another\
      \ chance does reveal a lot of good things about it. The ships are good. There\
      \ is excellent variety and quality art. The game design and game play is reasonable\
      \ and well thought out. Unfortunately the game feels too slow over all. Even\
      \ playing with a speed human deck it feels like you are grinding away in order\
      \ to win.\n\nIf you are looking for a new card game, you could certainly do\
      \ worse. This game doesn\u2019t make it into my recommend list, but that doesn\u2019\
      t mean it won\u2019t make it into yours."
