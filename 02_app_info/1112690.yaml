    review: 'I met the dev''s (or a good chunk of them) at dreamhack 1019, and began
      my journey to own VR (had to get a pc card that could handle it and all that
      fun stuff).  This is just such a great concept, and executed nicely.  It''s
      great for parties/gettogethers and it''s friendly to all ages.  You should definitely
      have this in your arsenal if you own VR.


      The Devs are also quite active in their discord and respond to feedback and
      bug reports, I personally have helped test several bugs I''ve found on the oculus
      platform!'
