What a shame. I was actually enjoying this series.\n\n   For the first handful of Chapters, this was an adventure comparable in quality to its predecessor, Trial of the Demon Hunter. Sure, there were some flaws: the music felt a little lazier this time 'round (as if some of the weaker tracks had been saved for a game other than the first); there were definitely more typos than previously; and at least one minor plot-hole reared its ugly head (in which I gained a \"Ring of Owls\" - which gave me a brief yet enigmatic experience - then seemingly lost said Ring of Owls when I attained a Ring of Lions...which proceeded to give me the EXACT SAME enigmatic experience)! \n\n   There's also a totally gratuitous attempt to get some romance happenin' in one or two parts, but in all fairness I suspect that's more of a Choice of Games thing than the author's personal preference (one can only hope).\n\n   So far, so forgivable. Then I reached what I assumed was the climax, or darned near enough...and it was all downhill from there.\n\n   First major problem: the save system, which kicks in when you die. Not only is it pointless in an interactive novel to keep going back a good many passages - I just made the same choices, over and over, with the same consequences - but I also ended up completely restarting my game by accident three times, thanks to the default choice on the load screen being \"Restart Completely\"! The first two times I swallowed it, and did my best to spam my way back to where I'd left off. The third time I threw in the towel. Not happy, Jan.\n\n   Second major problem: there's a riddle asked by an Ogre, and I'm not sure if it's some strange RNG thing, or failing that an incremental mechanic...but the same response will sometimes get you killed and other times allow you to progress. Suffice it to say, it was my frustration with this part of the game that led to two of the aforementioned accidental restarts. Enough's enough, really.\n\n   For now, at least, I'm going to classify this game as \"broken\". My tolerance for imperfections is fairly high, but an almost complete lack of game-testing is simply not acceptable, especially for a product asking cold, hard cash. Here's hoping the developer addresses these issues in the future, as I did think there was some potential here.\n\n   Verdict: 4.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1522844462,"timestamp_updated":1523111270,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603408336639404297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw57Kg0OICfKe2nQE="}
