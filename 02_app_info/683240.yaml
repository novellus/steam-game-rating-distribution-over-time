    review: 'Solid port of a formerly mobile-only top down hack and slasher. Loaded
      with characters and items to unlock, as well as the ability to battle the ghost
      characters of other players once you level your own up enough. While playing,
      Apocalypse Knights comes across as a blend of Darksiders and Dynasty Warriors,
      with later levels losing almost all resemblance to our world. Zero lag with
      screenfuls of enemies too, which was nice. Controls very well with mouse and
      keyboard. Decent audio, but the soundtrack does tend to get a little grating
      during extended play sessions.


      Note this game is built around grinding, so much so that you can let the AI
      it ships with play for you and even unlock achievements if you''d like...just
      expect it to nearly die often on higher difficulties. I spent 43 hours unlocking
      all of the achievements, but you could probably do the same a bit under 38 if
      you worked at it. I grabbed this during the launch discount at just under 9
      dollars, its new price of a little under 6 is a steal.'
