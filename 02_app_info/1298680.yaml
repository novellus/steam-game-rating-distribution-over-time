      \ total victory (and bragging rights) over your friends! There are multiple\
      \ mounted weapons in your arsenal including long-range cannons and close quarters\
      \ shotguns, and many throwable devices available for purchase.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nThese include:<br />\r\n\u25CB Homing Missiles that hunt down your opponents.<br\
      \ />\r\n\u25CB Particle Turrets that bombard the enemy.<br />\r\n\u25CB Landmines\
      \ for strong area control.<br />\r\n\u25CB EMP grenades to immobilise your enemy.<br\
      \ />\r\nWith many more to come!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose from unique maps such\
      \ as:<br />\r\n\u25CB Grid Gulch, our simple yet action packed original map.<br\
      \ />\r\n\u25CB Caverns, a confined space with many pillars allowing you to transition\
      \ to the ceiling.<br />\r\n\u25CB Valleys, a multilevel map with many points\
      \ of engagement.<br />\r\n\u25CB With more coming...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile\
      \ players duke it out, our Drone, Skipper, will be televising the events to\
      \ the audience while also displaying his video feed on massive screens around\
      \ the arena. He prioritises the best performing players, but don't worry! If\
      \ you feel someone is getting too much of the spotlight, don't hesitate to target\
      \ Skipper and take him down from the sky!"
