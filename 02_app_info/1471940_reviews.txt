It is a good game. The problem with Bahamian Rhapsody is it's only a good game. \n\nBahamian Rhapsody isn't memorable and doesn't stand out in any way, shape, or form. There is some brilliant stuff here, but it's brought down by the other parts that are just good, or passable. I quite liked the jokes in the beginning and humor throughout. The craziest thing you've ever done section near the end was especially entertaining. However, I wish this scene happened much earlier in the story, as it's the one that really let's players get to know the girls. I do feel that these stories along with Yellow Watergate should be scenes that have their own unique art like the ending and love scene and should be something the player plays through given their critical importance. This would also make them have a far greater impact.\n\nThe romance at the end felt like it didn't have a proper build up to it and just sort of happened. I think this could have been fixed if the developer didn't yadda, yadda, yadda over all the scenes where the girls would be bonding prior to that moment, such as going jet skiing and to the music concert. I found it frustrating that there was build up to these moments and then when you'd transition to them what you got was a scene of the girls talking immediately after the big event was over depriving me of that moments significance and impact. It felt like showing up for a movie only to have missed it and arrived while everyone else is walking out of the show talking about how great it was. These scenes need to be in the game with special art like we got for the ending scene and love scene and accompanied by dialogue and narrative that further characterizes these ladies and brings them and the reader closer together.\n\nMore choices would have also helped flesh out the romance and narrative, as well as give the player more control. As it stands the paltry few choices I could make during the story didn't feel like they had any meaning or impact. I felt more like I was playing a kinetic visual novel than a normal visual novel and I was just along for the ride. \n\nMore art would have also helped. There are like six background images and three different expressions for each character. I felt like I was seeing the same thing over and over while playing through the game. This monotony led to boredom halfway through.\n\nDespite these criticisms, everything that is present in this game is done in a competent manner. Nothing is outright bad. There are some scenes and instances that are great. The rest is just good. I was happy with the ending I got and it did feel very natural to arrive at given how the story went. Bahamian Rhapsody is a good game. It's just feels like the developer isn't living up to their full potential, which is such a shame in light of the many instances where the developer shows it could do and be more.","timestamp_created":1609862848,"timestamp_updated":1609862848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4LPT6fYCcuTewAI="}
