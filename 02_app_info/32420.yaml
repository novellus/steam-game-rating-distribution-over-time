    review: 'The new processing of the games is not bad in terms of stories, it is
      not the strong point of the game.

      In terms of Gameplay, the game is excellent, the game is light and clear, you
      know what to do in a given mission, the character dialogues are short and concise.
      The missions are short and in each mission they play more often for a different
      character in terms of characters, so I''m sorry that we can''t change characters
      in the main story. As for the Jedi, the control is simple, one way to control
      the force, the other with a sword attack, the third you jump. Clones shoot a
      little worse, although there are two shooting options. For fans of Clone Wars
      and for them very demanding players on the story, the game will fulfill what
      you expect. As for people who like a good story, the game will not appeal. Personally,
      I enjoy the game and recommend it to all Clone Wars fans.
