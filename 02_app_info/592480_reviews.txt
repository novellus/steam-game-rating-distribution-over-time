I glanced at it a bit, noticed \"Double Fine\", and thought from the looks of it that it would be something in the vein of [i]Costume Quest[/i], which I loved. But alas, I missed out that \"Foam Sword\" was the developer and it wasn't the same group of people.\n\nSo right away I realized that [i]Knights & Bikes[/i] wasn't trying to be like that games, which is also fine. Although it was associated with why I bought the game during a sale, it didn't mean I'd turn the game away.\n\nWhen it started off, I was interested in the style and thought the game was funny with the way the kids interacted, things like the goose (Captain Honkers), et cetera. So I thought, well, it'll be interesting anyway.\n\nAlas, I lost that interest. The graphics and art style are great. The idea they're going towards with the story makes sense. I don't think I'm even halfway through the game but I've already figured out (possible endgame spoilers, assuming I'm right) [spoiler]that Nessa isn't real, because nobody has seen or addressed her; and Demelza is going through a mental breakdown with this imaginary adventure[/spoiler]. So I can see that story being fitting.\n\nBut on the game-side, it's nothing special. There's too much wandering around empty areas, then you'll end up at a set-piece where you need to walk, knock a few boxes or items, fight a few enemies, rinse and repeat. The combat doesn't seem to gain any depth. Also, I got quite tired of some of the sound effects, in particular the running noises, but you can't disable them without affecting other audio.\n\nI think a problem I've encountered with games in general is that I dislike them if they aim for breadth instead of depth, which is what I think happened here. The combat wasn't really necessary and they could've just done a handful of battles in the whole game instead of doing a lot of lesser battles. Hunting for treasure chests, currency for bike upgrades, \"open\" areas with vague puzzle aspects in some places... Most of it wasn't really necessary and it pulls me out of the game when there's so many aspects that don't add up to much.\n\nOne of my favorite indie games in the past handful of years was [i]Celeste[/i] which focused solely on platforming as its gameplay mechanics, then built graphics and story on top of it.\n\nThis game, however, seemed to throw a little bit of this, a little bit of that, perhaps for its developers to experiment but it was also detrimental to my experience.\n\nI think the maps could've been smaller and the game more straightforward, focusing more directly on its story. If that was the case, I'd have likely finished. But since it tried to act like a bigger game, it didn't hold.","timestamp_created":1609732267,"timestamp_updated":1609732267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v6Ph5fYCdaOkwAI="}
