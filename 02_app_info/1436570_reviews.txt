I enjoyed the relaxing gameplay and music. It looks like they decided to scrap the whole potion making options that were in the last Enthralling Realms game. For me it´s far the best of the 3 or 4 existing parts so far. There is a thrilling story line and interesting characters with good voice over, who appear with the ongoing story. The graphics are bright and clear and the special effects are unrivalled in other match-3 games I,´ve played. There are four different types of Power-ups available, and each one requires a Mana Meter refill after each use. The Mana Meter is refilled by making any Match, but larger matches will fill the meter more quickly. There are 5 chapters and at the end of each you have to defeat a beast to clear a chapter.Blacksmith's Revenge is a really good Match 3 game with interesting board layouts that present a good challenge. The only two small minus points are that there is no option to select difficulty modes such as Relaxed, Normal or Hard and I hate I hate all the spiders that appear in the cut scenes.\n","timestamp_created":1603311245,"timestamp_updated":1603311245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5942535400390625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47IKzpvUCeYinqQI="}
