    about_the_game: "Blending the tactical precision of modern stealth titles with\
      \ the unprecedented immersion of VR, Espire 1: VR Operative is the gold-standard\
      \ VR stealth FPS. In Espire, the technology of virtual reality has been militarized,\
      \ allowing you to become the ultimate super-spy as you pilot an Espire Model\
      \ 1 Operative from the comfort of your very own cutting-edge \u201CControl Theatre\u201D\
      .  Yes, the danger - including motion sickness - has been minimized, but the\
      \ threats are very, very real. It\u2019s your job as an Espire Agent to identify\
      \ threats and eliminate them before they seize control over the IFA Facility.\
      \  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEspire takes full advantage of virtual reality technology\
      \ and design to create a deeply satisfying stealth/action FPS while also minimizing\
      \ drawbacks like motion sickness through the fully customizable Control Theatre\
      \ system. In Espire, full-freedom movement maintains immersion and feels more\
      \ comfortable than ever. So you can worry less about taking a break, and more\
      \ about how you want to play. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEspire 1: VR Operative Key\
      \ Features Include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* The definitive VR stealth experience:\
      \ bringing the stealth genre to the exciting medium of Virtual Reality, delivering\
      \ gameplay mechanics for the stealth and action genres that have yet to be explored.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n* Full freedom of movement: allowing players the freedom to\
      \ move anywhere within their virtual environment, moving, climbing, and falling\
      \ with full comfort and no motion sickness for almost all players.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n* Complete single-player story, rich in detail: developed as a dedicated\
      \ single player VR experience with individual story missions and scenario missions\
      \ that use the story mission environments for short challenges.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n* Voice control: Using the VR headset\u2019s onboard microphone, players\
      \ can make commands and perform actions simply by speaking. The noises players\
      \ make can draw the enemy to their location \u2013 adding a new way to gain\
      \ the advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Arsenal of weapons and gadgets: As an\
      \ Espire model 1 Operative, players will have access to dozens of unique gadgets\
      \ and weapons such as a tranquilizer pistol and deployable spy cameras in order\
      \ to complete the mission objectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Global Leaderboard:\
      \ A worldwide tally awards players a competitive score based on mission time,\
      \ movement, stealth, ammo conservation, takedowns and other factors.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n* Intuitive controls that mimic real life: Interaction in this game\
      \ aims to be natural and intuitive. Instead of memorizing dozens of button combinations\
      \ for every action, players perform them as they would in real life. Operatives\
      \ can crouch and enter cover by physically using their body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n* Smart AI: Enemy combatants in this game actively hunt the player. The AI\
      \ responds to sight, sound, and other stimuli and will react to with varying\
      \ levels of suspicion based on the player\u2019s physical stance, movement speed,\
      \ cover and relative location."
