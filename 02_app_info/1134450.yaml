      <br><br>Last night, I woke up without being able to remember what had happened
      to me, as if I had just been born yesterday. But no one could also prove that
      &quot;the past&quot; is real. It''s possible that I just &quot;existed&quot;
      now, and my memories were just fabricated.<br><br>This is me right now, lost,
      confused, and don''t know where to go. Maybe I was just being born last night,
      but somehow, &quot;my past&quot; still haunted me. I can''t remember it, but
      they said I am the one responsible who dropped the helicopter.<br><br>Fuck!
      If only I could remember something. I can''t even remember my own name. But
      why?! Even though I can''t remember my own name, but I can remember the one
      who made me like this?!<br><br>It''s not only that....I''m not even sure if
      I''m a human being. Not after what happened today. I can stop the rain. No,
      it''s not like I can change rain to sunny weather...I make thousand droplets
      of rain stop falling, hanging it in the air like defying the gravitation around
      me. <br><br>.... Far from the bottom of my heart, I''m sure that I have to end
