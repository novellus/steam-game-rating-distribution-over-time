Overall this ship has some serious flaws, but also some serious firepower when its fully upgraded. Although right now with certain changes to how players can get credits (like the massive stealth nerf to open world play) this ship will take you a significant amount of time to upgrade. So I would personally go with a custodian (which is by far one of the best frigates in the game, but still takes a significant amount of time to upgrade) or I would go with one of the other frigates on sale. This ship seems more like a nostalgia thing, but it wont be getting you any clout on the battlefield unless you are really good at ducking and dodging incoming fire in a ship that has the design of a plate (think cross section and think about how someone easily can hit you, but you cannot easily hit them, and that will give you an idea of how the ship is.) Also with alien ships you must upgrade them fully to get full use out of them. Also getting the components are parts for this ship is going to take a significant amount of time. So do not think that when you get this out of the box it will be combat ready. Since its not.","timestamp_created":1607897325,"timestamp_updated":1607897325,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43MOJr/YCdYn7uQI="}
