    about_the_game: Action takes place in player-made locations called Lounges which
      are made through the Lounge Editor by shaping terrain, setting time of day and
      placing various objects. The creator of the Lounge is able to set various permissions,
      privacy settings and invite others to visit. The owner and visitors are also
      able to populate the Lounge with various Interactable Objects that might just
      be a simple prop, an arcade machine. The only goal in Project Lounge is to have
      fun.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong> Lounge Editor</strong>
      - It's just like your usual map editor, with no object caps, just the way we
      love it on PC. The only limit is your system specifications.<br></li><li><strong>
      Interactable Objects</strong> - Drawboards for drawing, Arcades to play, Vinyls
      to play and more! Earn them by playing the game and receiving drops, even while
      you're in the Lounge Editor!<br></li><li><strong> Steam Inventory</strong> -
      Collect, trade and sell your Interactable Objects through Steam Inventory and
      show off what you've got to your friends and visitors alike.<br></li><li><strong>
