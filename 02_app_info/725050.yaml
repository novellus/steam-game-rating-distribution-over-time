    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/U8HpqyJBuOQ\n\nVery close\
      \ call for me on whether to recommend it or not. While it is cheap, arcade fun,\
      \ it's also very light on content. I got this on a Steam sale for $3.59 USD\
      \ and still think that was too much. Whole game can be finished in 25-45 minutes.\
      \ There are only 5 levels / scenes. The first three levels just involve shooting\
      \ at static targets within a time limit.\n\nLevels 4 has a higher difficulty\
      \ curve and requires moving and shooting at moving targets very quickly. Although\
      \ there are three weapons, you only really use two of them, which is the handgun\
      \ and the AK-47. While you can two-hand the AK, you really don't need to. Reloads\
      \ are semi-realistic as you'll need to pop in the clip and then charge the weapon\
      \ before firing. \n\nYou have full locomotion but there is no snap or smooth\
      \ turning. You can reset view but you're not quite always facing the direction\
      \ you're looking when using it. The voice acting is laughably bad and difficult\
      \ to understand. The game ran smoothly and there are only a few options that\
      \ were already set to epic. \n\nThis is cheap arcade fun at the end of the day.\
      \ While I did have fun, there wasn't much to the game. I am giving a neutral\
      \ recommendation. Buy on deep, deep sale or in a bundle. I don't think it's\
      \ worth $8.99 USD, there simply isn't enough content and the quality of content\
      \ is overall lacking. I'd say it should be $1.99 at the absolute most given\
      \ what's here.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I think they stole a clip from Snoop Dog, but\
      \ hey, that's Thug Life 4 real ... Ya heard![/b]"
