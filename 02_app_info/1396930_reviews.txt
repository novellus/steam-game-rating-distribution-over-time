Yes, yes it is. So many things are wrong with this game and as far as I could tell there are no redeeming qualities. \n\nAll the assets are low quality and oddly shiny. The music is loud and obnoxious and sometimes play louder then the narrator so you cant hear what's going on. The gun has no real physics to it and you can fire it during the cutscenes which are annoyingly long and make up about 60% of the story mode.\n\nI could go on and on about the enemies not hurting you, the boring \"Horror\" mode or the fps meter that I am 90% sure is faked to make it seem like you are getting more fps then you really are (Pretty sure my computer isn't bouncing between 60-300 fps when not moving) but I want to make sure to get my refund in as soon as possible.","timestamp_created":1601941978,"timestamp_updated":1601941978,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.741648077964782715","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwudfL/fQCfMiPpgI="}
