I really like the overall dark setting of the game, and while I somewhat wish there was a little more debauchery, it was still a fun ride. It definitely felt almost like a prototype for what the company would later make, Dramatical Murder. As every review mentions, noncon is rampant in this game so don't play if that type of thing in a BL is not for you!","timestamp_created":1609399018,"timestamp_updated":1609399018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoYTq2/YCe9qDvwI="}
