    review: "[h1]\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 - \nI now know where my slight interest\
      \ and appreciation for classical orchestra music came from lol[/h1]\nK of course\
      \ i suggest this game for a fun little 2D over head shooter and the start of\
      \ the Army Men franchise which lasted through the beginning of PC as a strategy\
      \ builder like star craft with the 2D shooter, and a few consoles when it changed\
      \ to more of a 3rd person shoulder shooter, and its cheap so its worth seeing\
      \ if it will run for you if you played it before.\n\n[b]+General+[/b]\n\nthis\
      \ was the last of the beginning games that are overhead 2d shooters, but also\
      \ was the 1st one where they finally got the controls down perfect, so you can\
      \ use the w,s,a,d to move sarge but also the mouse to move or click to shoot\
      \ in that direction while using the buttons to run and dive, using 1-6 will\
      \ now select the item in your inventory and you can set F1-F6 to auto select\
      \ a group of soldiers you group together, and they seemed to have left the Battle\
      \ Mode / offline / LAN multiplayer in this one! not sure why they took it out\
      \ of Army Men 2 (-_-)\n\nyou can also right click and drag across the screen\
      \ to highlight a few soldiers or all of them to move together, or the R G T\
      \ buttons rally them to you or you can select a couple soldiers and hit defend\
      \ button to tell them to stay somewhere while you move on, so the ability to\
      \ divide your force now is great, also you can just pick 1 of the other soldiers\
      \ to play as just like Sarge but the aliens cant dive or roll etc. so you can\
      \ divide your force and organize them to toggle between using which guys.\n\n\
      but one of the biggest benefits of Toys in Space is you can use items on your\
      \ other soldiers, so if you select the medic item in your inventory and press\
      \ Space you will use it on Sarge, but you can also just move the mouse over\
      \ to the picture of the soldier in your group and heal them, and you can see\
      \ their stats by selecting them on the field and checking the right panel, also\
      \ dont forget to put your team into your vehicles like tanks, boats, jeeps etc.\
      \ or you can even put them in a tank to defend the area while Sarge runs off\
      \ to do other stuff, so now think of all the other green soldiers as Sarges'\
      \ to a shorter degree of ability.\n\nthe bad thing about these games is the\
      \ objective isnt always clear, so you may spend time walking around looking\
      \ at stuff to see if you can do something with it, so make sure to use your\
      \ objectives menu / map and you can scroll around the map by clicking on it\
      \ in the top right panel, if you have to run a long distance and you know there\
      \ isnt any enemies in that area you can just move the screen to that part of\
      \ the map and click, then wait for sarge to run up to that area, then click\
      \ on his pic on the left again to go back to his fixed screen and R to re-rally\
      \ your teammates or just highlight them.\n\n[b]+Issues+[/b]\n\nthis game is\
      \ super old tho as well so it doesnt run great, i havent had many issues with\
      \ the controls or actually playing like some users mention, but just keep in\
      \ mind its an old 640x480 game upscaled so [b]Do Not Windows Out,[/b] lol it\
      \ doesnt like it and you will be Ctrl Alt Deleting your way out\n\nalso be ready\
      \ for loud cutscenes like old games like to cuz the audio control doesnt effect\
      \ videos etc. so instead of using the in-game volume settings, leave them maxed\
      \ or adjusted for the right SFX to music and other sounds, then open the Windows\
      \ Volume Mixer and lower the sound level of this games application input, which\
      \ will make all sounds coming from the game the same lower level so no more\
      \ blowing your ears off in cutscenes.\n\nalthough im guessing this wont be a\
      \ problem for most users cuz the only ones that may wanna buy it are ppl that\
      \ played it before as kids lol, i dont see many kids that grew up with the ps2\
      \ and on their whole lives wanting to play this."
