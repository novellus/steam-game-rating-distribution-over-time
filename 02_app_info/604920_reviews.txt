The story is also mysterious and captivating. There's a lot of extra stuff to do and collect. Some areas of the game are a bit poorly designed, since it can be hard to find your way (and there's no map, at least not that I managed to find).\n\nDespite the gripes -- I'd love to see a similar game in the future, or maybe even a sequel? :P","timestamp_created":1608732254,"timestamp_updated":1608732254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw88P6x/YCeZq+vAI="}
