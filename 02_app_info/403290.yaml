    review: I think it just wasn't for me. I felt like I didn't actually make any
      decisions, but apparently I did? There were so many places I tried to go one
      direction and there wasn't anything there, that it discouraged me from looking
      for the few places that sort of thing worked. And the game moved a little too
      slowly for me, and the controls were very simple and it was unclear when I had
      the option to do additional things besides scrolling the screen one way or another.
