Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted.<br><br>However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her?
