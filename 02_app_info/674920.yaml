    review: "Unfortunately I can't recommend it in its current state. The pictures\
      \ are well done, and the information is interesting, but functionally it needs\
      \ some work. Most of the subclasses seem to be complex for the sake of complexity;\
      \ science dice, forge dice, defense dice, fortune points, entropy points, cap\
      \ points, spider points, etc. It's just another thing you need to keep track\
      \ of. The best mechanics are both straightforward and compelling. What's more,\
      \ most of the subclasses require you to be one of the new races. \n\nMost of\
      \ the races are acceptably balanced, but some of them have abilities that are\
      \ inexplicably strong. Did melee damage to someone? Now as a bonus action you\
      \ can do more melee damage and knock them prone. No weapon? Don't worry about\
      \ it, you have a natural weapon that does 1d8 with reach and knocks them prone.\
      \ If a player decides to play a gnome barbarian just for laughs they might not\
      \ be quite as strong as someone who chooses a goliath, but it's still not game-changing.\
      \ On the other hand, some (2 in particular) of the race options in this are\
      \ just head and shoulders above the rest. The opportunity cost is too high to\
      \ not pick them."
