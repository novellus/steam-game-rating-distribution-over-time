    review: First Do not use the short cut icon for the game.  It probably wont work
      unless you have Win XP computer. I am using a Win 7 . Set your Steam icon to
      "run as administrator" and play the game directly on Steam on the desktop- either
      in windowed or full screen. It works just fine that way. In administrator it
      allows the game to reconfigure itself for compatibility issues. This is a great
      game.  Somewhat addictivly fun. I love the different ways Granny gets to defend
      herself. You know Practical items that a granny could have like a loaded purse
      and a frying pan.  I'm only in an earlier level so not sure what else there
      might be but so far it is a fun game. Not a shoot-em-up. You only get knocked
      down by dogs and Tiki-men.  Look for the Tiki-man eating plant it's very helpful.  Enjoy.  Great
      for kids too.
