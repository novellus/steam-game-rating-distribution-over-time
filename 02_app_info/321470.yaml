    review: 'Worth it when it is on sale or full price if you have a lot of money.  I
      recently bought it for $5.99.  The lake has a nice shape: It is a triangle up
      top that goes into round shape on the bottom.  It also has a pretty big size.  I
      only own this DLC and it is my favourite lake out of this lake and the ones
      you get with the base game.  A close second is the dam lake on the base game.


      I have a soft spot for this game for various reasons even if the frames per
      second may drop (may just be my old PC) not intolerable.  It is nice with it
      being cold outside and being able to play this indoors, especially with the
      new maps.


      I will probably also buy Waldsee and Bergsee when they go on sale.  Bergsee
      looks pretty gorgeous.


      One thing I forgot (unless my memory fails me) the DLC is only a 300MB download
      and not 2GB.'
