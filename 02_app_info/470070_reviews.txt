For some reason you’re not allowed to use your progress from the main game either, so this is pretty much a micro-campaign where you start with 13 upgrade points instead. It’ll also only take you maybe 30 minutes at most. It also contributes next to nothing to MD’s story. Basically, I have no idea why this exists. But you can play it, I guess? If you needed more evidence that Mankind Divided was mistreated, here it is.\n\n[b]System Rift:[/b]\nYou do an infiltration mission for Pritchard and it’s very hacker focused. It’s nice to see Pritchard return, but it again doesn’t contribute much to MD’s story and it takes place in the same city. Also despite taking place almost immediately after MD’s ending, it doesn’t acknowledge your main game progress. Which means this is another mini-campaign where you start with a clean inventory and skill tree again. Also the story is blatantly supposed to get you to play Breach when you finish it. (Don't play Breach.) Overall it doesn’t do anything notable for MD and Deus Ex content really should be more than just “you can play it I guess.”\n\n[b]A Criminal Past:[/b]\nA lot more interesting, but that’s not saying much. Jensen recollects on a mission he had to do in a prison, which took place between HR & MD. The story actually gives good reason for why you start with no inventory or augments unlocked this time, so that’s good. You’ll pretty much be forced to use stealth for a good chunk of it but considering the circumstance of the mission’s story that’s to be expected. Despite the fact that I liked this DLC the most out of the three, it’s a little too short and it still doesn’t do much for MD’s story. If they had only focused on A Criminal Past for MD’s DLC and expanded upon it though, it probably would have been on par of HR’s The Missing Link. (It’s also worth noting that the DLC crashed on me near the end, and I had to reduce MD’s access to my processor cores to get around it. Just beware.)\n\n[b]Bonus items:[/b]\nlmao.\n\nOverall the entire pass is a wasted opportunity to add meaningful story to MD and is kind of a waste of time. Even if a sequel for MD finally happens, I’m doubtful much from this season pass is going to matter. Two of the DLCs pointlessly ignoring your main game progress helped absolutely nothing too. If you're all in with Deus Ex regardless, then at least get this pass on a sale.","timestamp_created":1609583351,"timestamp_updated":1609662992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6IHZ4/YCe8TXvwI="}
