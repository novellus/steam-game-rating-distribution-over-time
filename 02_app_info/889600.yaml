      notes: "The game contains some sexual material in the dialogue: \u201C[T]hey\
        \ think with their d*cks and not their heads...\u201D; \u201C...[Y]ou\u2019\
        re always staring at their boobs\u201D; \u201CI've encountered molesters and\
        \ peeping Toms everywhere\"; \u201CAnd what do you think happens when you\
        \ try to watch sexual stuff behind your mom\u2019s back?\u201D\r\n\r\nUltimately,\
        \ mature content revolves around strong language that conveys both sexual\
        \ and violent thematic elements."

      \u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal words :\n\
      This game re-invented the turn based RPG genre with some amazing time-line based\
      \ fighthing style. You have to think before doing your move when if comes to\
      \ bosses or you might get one shot (if you play at higher difficulty) The character\
      \ have their own unique move and one does not feel like a clone of another but\
      \ with different element. \n\nIf you are familiar with persona series, you might\
      \ enjoy the social link system? Well in this game it's taken to the extreme.\
      \ Each. Single. NPC. Will ask for something (basically a quest) in order for\
      \ you to befriend them, which then unlock access to their friend with yet another\
      \ quest and so on.... Some of them are pretty much the same thing over and over\
      \ so it's not that much of a hassle, it's still a great feature and makes every\
      \ NPC a little bit more alive. Plus, there is a feature where you can send messages\
      \ to any NPC to ask about their lives, what they like, etc. (it's a great way\
      \ to learn more about your waifu/husbando!)\n\nFor once, A company did a port\
      \ of a game to PC CORRECTLY.\nThe control on PC use the mouse and mouse wheel\
      \ perfectly in menu, it's instinctive, fast, well.... perfect.\n\nIt is sad\
      \ to see such a lovely game go under the radar, once again because \"it's a\
      \ vita game\" but trust me.... Furyu is a HUUUUUUGEEEE developper but mainly\
      \ focus on Japan exclusive title. If you actually buy this game, you might provide\
      \ the support required for them to export their game a little bit more around\
      \ the globe! ^_^\n\nI hope this review helps a bit and gives you a better idea\
      \ regarding this game which is, hands down, one of the best J-RPG I played in\
      \ years. Like I said, it is unique, beautiful, A-MA-ZING soundtrack and the\
      \ gameplay is smoooooth (you hit an ennemy, the fight begin instantly, no cute\
      \ cutscene and stuff).\n\nBUY IT! :D"
