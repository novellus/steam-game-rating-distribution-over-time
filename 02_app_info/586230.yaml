    review: 'Awesome interactive lovecraftian story  based on decision making with
      several endings and a lot of thought about mysticism or rather occultism.

      Without spoilers - a truely beautifully written adventure evoking "Call of Cthulhu"
      settings with all its hints, twists, used sujets (if you recognize them), but
      without RPG elements. Instead, you can go back in time and reconsider every
      decision. Making notes (page number for interesting desicion) were useful to
      me, but unnecessary and for most people probably exaggerated.'
