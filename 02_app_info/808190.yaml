      \ from pizza dude or taxi driver to a magnetic superbike from the year 2400,\
      \ everything you can imagine (and more) will race against each other in 4 crazy\
      \ worlds, Karting like never before.<br><br>If you finished first, you are the\

      \ that you can (but don't want to) imagine.  Only the bravest of all racers\
      \ make it this far, but it takes a Supersonic Racer to win.</li></ul>"
