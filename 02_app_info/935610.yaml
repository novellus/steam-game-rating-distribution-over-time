    review: I am in the midst of the game and will probably go a little further as
      every new level in the story mode keeps introducing a couple new alternatives
      for us to choose from. The game is basically a "Mastermind (board game)" minus
      the "mind" part. You have to guess what gene you just unlocked and what genes
      the mission tells you to find (or mix). The game is destined to have a repetitive
      play. There are bits of Huxley's book here and there and some satirical pieces
      here and there. On a side note I had this game in my wishlist for a good while
      and I am disappointed overall.
