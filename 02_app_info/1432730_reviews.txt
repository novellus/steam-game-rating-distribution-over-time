Its fairly new, and at start its kinda fun to play, but it just gets the same random events, and gameplay after an hour just feels like itÂ´s not really worth it. Perhaps later stages in Development will fix it. So will probably come back to play later","timestamp_created":1608576186,"timestamp_updated":1608576186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6Zanw/YCeoqAvAI="}
