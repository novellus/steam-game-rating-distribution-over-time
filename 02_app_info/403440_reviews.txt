It'd be one thing if I could change the controls, so I could say perhaps have ones I am more used to for platformers on computer (z, x and c being some of the key controls) but this one its got space to jump and most of the other important keys are at the top left of the keyboard!\n\nSecondly, and an annoyance for me as someone who likes being able to see more of whats going on, it seems you can't do fullscreen for it. Just small like gameboy sized screen and a large one closer to a DS.\n\nCannot recommend this game, even if the style of pixel graphics is cool.","timestamp_created":1575904272,"timestamp_updated":1575904272,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NvN9e4CcoSa4wE="}
