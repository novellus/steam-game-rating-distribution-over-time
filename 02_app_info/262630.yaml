    about_the_game: Tom vs. the Armies of Hell is a challenging indie Action-Adventure
      game from Darkmire Entertainment. You play Tom, a down-trodden software-engineer
      turned reluctant half-demon hero when an experiment gone awry sends his entire
      office complex plummeting into Hell. <br><br>Armed with an experimental gun
      that turns captured souls into high-tech, multi-colored death, as well as his
      newly acquired demonic powers, Tom must not only survive, but also unravel the
      mystery of what caused this &quot;accident&quot;, and how he can get home. Along
      the way Tom will be aided (or more accurately, bossed around) by Beezle, the
      purple imp that saved him from the initial demonic invasion. Together they'll
      face a horde of mindless ghouls, vicious demons, and an army of magically animated
      junk automatons, just for starters.<br><br>So grab your trusty Soul Blaster
      x9000, duct-tape some phone-books to your extremities, and blast your way through
      the plains of eternal damnation!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Enjoy
      a story-driven single-player campaign -- just like mom used to make! <br></li><li>Blast
      away with a dynamic gun system, where absorbed souls turn into rainbow-colored
      death.<br></li><li>Laugh out loud with an original, humorous story revealed
      across six challenging levels.<br></li><li>Stare at beautifully animated 2D
      and in-game cutscenes.<br></li><li>Mow through hordes of procedurally placed
      enemies. No two playthroughs are exactly alike!</li></ul>
