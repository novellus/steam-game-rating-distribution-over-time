    review: "my biggest takeaway from this game is: could've been better, could've\
      \ been worse.\n\npros:\n- very nicely established setting with little nods and\
      \ slang terms fitting for the time\n- likeable characters with their own motivations\
      \ and relations\n- interesting story, with a couple twists and turns despite\
      \ the length of it\n- the writing has a good flow and doesn't feel overly cumbersome\
      \ or needlessly pretentious\n\ncons:\n- very short \n- narration often tells\
      \ rather than shows, and brushes past events very quickly\n    (e.g. the choice\
      \ \n        o i talk them down\n    immediately leads to the statement 'you\
      \ talk. they didn't like that and beat you tf up. you go home.')\n- often doesn't\
      \ clarify between your character's thoughts and speech in choices\n    (e.g.\
      \ someone insults you and the choices are\n        o i don't take offense, i'm\
      \ just here to get paid\n        o \"go sit on a cactus,\" i tell him\n    but\
      \ both lead characters to react as though you've said everything aloud one-to-one)\n\
      \n???:\n- i got beat up by a gang, knocked out and left for dead in a cave,\
      \ and then shot twice, but still somehow lived through a happy ending\n- you\
      \ can pick a sweetheart, but only get to know their name and occupation beforehand\n\
      - there's no strict time constraints for activities (aka you can pm just ask\
      \ all the questions always)\n- you can be a native american lesbian who spied\
      \ for the confederacy. or a gay cowboy who fought slavery. or a former slave\
      \ and buffalo soldier.\n- everyone will treat you the exact same, regardless\
      \ of your choices about gender/race/alignment in the civil war/etc.\n\nall in\
      \ all, a neat little story, but not really anything to write home about either"
