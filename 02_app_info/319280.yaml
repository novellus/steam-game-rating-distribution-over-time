    review: "A  Jogabilidade \xE9 muito boa, sem combos infinitos nem muito longos\
      \ apesar de que d\xE1 pra petecar o inimigo 3 vezes o que eu acho demais, mesmo\
      \ assim o gameplay vale a pena, o que \xE9 realmente ruim \xE9 n\xE3o ter ninguem\
      \ online, pelo menos eu n\xE3o achei. Al\xE9m disso \xE9 um jogo mal acabado\
      \ sem capricho em v\xE1rios aspectos de apresenta\xE7\xE3o, acho que muita gente\
      \ pegou no acesso antecipado e esperou a finaliza\xE7\xE3o que nunca veio. Recomendo\
      \ se vc tiver com quem tirar uns contras ou for s\xF3 curioso como eu."
