      \ is a chaotic action arcade game for one to four players. It puts you in control\
      \ of the titular Spitlings: charming rectangular creatures with teeth they can\
      \ spit at bubbles or use to jump!<br><strong>Your goal is simple, but hard to\
      \ achieve: Get rid of all the bubbles bouncing around the screen! </strong><h2\

    review: I first played this game at dream hack and I was feeling kind of down
      but this game was a blast to play and the devs were really nice too. I haven't
      played this game solo but it is really fun and some times  frustrating in a
      good way. There is a story mode and a party mode and I've yet to try the party
      mode but I've no doubt it would be great to play drunk with friends.
