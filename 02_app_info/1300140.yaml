    about_the_game: "<strong> Introduction </strong><br><br>HereticOS MR  war simulator\
      \ is a target version of HereticOS virtual reality lab. The main goal of the\
      \ lab is to do technical verification for the development of social experience\
      \ such as simulating large-scale online war. Thanks to the breakthrough of HereticOS\
      \ network basic technology, HereticOS Mr Lab for war simulator can realize the\
      \ real-time online interaction of the largest 65000 online players on same server\
      \ and screen . The goal is that the world in one server and world is in same\
      \ screen. Due to the technical and cost constraints of Moore's law, the network\
      \ war experience of our laboratory can be the only experience in the world in\
      \ the next 30 years, so it will be updated, developed and maintained for a long\
      \ time.<br><br><br><br><strong> Current technical direction and characteristics\
      \ of the laboratory: </strong><br><br>1. Large scale independent AI, each AI\
      \ can be independently developed and implemented, and has certain social cooperation\
      \ ability, such as following the arrangement of department leaders to complete\
      \ specific tasks, AI is the main value and main line of war, not due to the\
      \ number of players.<br><br>2. Giant units, which include multiple components\
      \ and leading roles, can be found and collided, and carry basic role units to\
      \ complete war tasks.<br><br>3. The client has no logic, all logic is completed\
      \ in the AI virtual machine, the client has only basic input, and predicts the\
      \ response to the war results, so the plug-in can be minimized.<br><br>4. The\
      \ map has a maximum of 384 square kilometers, and the global public view has\
      \ a maximum of 18 kilometers. There is no war smoke, so you can see every war\
      \ detail in the world as long as you want.<br><br>5. 65000 units are on-line\
      \ with the same service and the same screen. The goal is to serve the same service\
      \ globally. In principle, they are not divided into different services. They\
      \ are only divided according to the needs of regional delay. There is no copy,\
      \ no krypton gold, one-time payment, limited free experience for life,<br><br>6.\
      \ 256 channel 3D stereo, real-time rendering battlefield sound effect<br><br>7.\
      \ Support X360 pad and vibration feedback.<br><br><br><strong> Play method </strong><br><br><br><br>1.\
      \ Players need to learn mainstream art tools, such as 3DMAX and C4D, to make\
      \ free mod or commercial mod for the laboratory, About mod res make knowledge,\
      \ can find by official community production group.<br><br>2. Players need to\
      \ participate in social activities through mainstream social tools, improve\
      \ your idea of war experience, and organize to find possible teams to participate\
      \ in mod production. If you don't have certain social ability, then 65000 people\
      \ will only have \u201Dyou\u201C and \u201DAI\u201C<br><br>3. If you are not\
      \ familiar with Chinese, you should learn Chinese and receive necessary Chinese\
      \ education, such as the Ichang, because war AI is written by I Ching language.\
      \ If you do not have the necessary Chinese literacy, it will be difficult to\
      \ organize a war with profound significance.<br><br>In the dawn DLC, we mainly\
      \ show the characteristics of war experience in the HereticOS Mr lab, including\
      \ four maps with different backgrounds in spring, summer, autumn and winter,\
      \ In this scene, there are three defensive tower fortresses, two opposing floating\
      \ castles, one attacking Castle wandering on the map, two teams, each with 30000\
      \ units. Three leaders respectively control three floating castles and two teams\
      \ of ground troops. One (Zhuge Liang) controls a team of archers to fire arrows\
      \ (30000), and one (Zhou Yu) controls an air castle to cruise and attack with\
      \ soldiers , a (Xu Chu) gathers a sword shield soldier opposite the archer.\
      \ The player can control a helicopter, manually control four simulation skills,\
      \ simulate and control the launch of four bombs of different sizes and weights,\
      \ and use the keyboard or handle to manually charge the skill capacitor. After\
      \ the charging is completed, release the corresponding charging button to launch\
      \ the projectile. After the shell hits the ground unit, the ground unit will\
      \ fall Death (units in the floating castle will not fall to death at this time),\
      \ and the ability capacitance determines the apparent speed of the projectile<br><br><br><br>The\
      \ difference between simulated launch and numerical control launch<br><br>Simulation\
      \ launch, the firing strength is determined by the skill capacitance, and the\
      \ ammunition speed is regulated by the infinite<br><br>Numerical control launch,\
      \ unable to control the skill firing intensity, each time the ammunition is\
      \ monotonous the same parameter (speed).<br><br><strong> About mod (DLC) production\
      \ </strong><br><br>1. Use blender, 3dmax and other production tools to make\
      \ 3D models for the game. The game supports static 3D models in the format of\
      \ 3DS FBX, obj, and character animation in MD2 format. If you have other character\
      \ animation models, you need to use the MD2 export plug-in of 3DMAX to convert\
      \ the animation model to MD2.<br><br>2. Provide sound effect materials. At present,\
      \ it supports MP3 file format and collective sound effect mode, that is, all\
      \ sound effects are put into one MP3 file<br><br>3. Put all game resource data\
      \ into the mod directory provided by you, such as &quot;data/Dawn&quot;<br><br>4.\
      \ Search HereticOS Mr Lab project in GitHub, download game resource definition\
      \ template GameRes.h gamereslib.h of dawn DLC, modify the definition according\
      \ to the resources you provide, compile and execute to generate mod resource\
      \ file, such as game.mod .<br><br>5. Go to the community to share your mod resources.\
      \ After we pass the review, they will be put into the hereticos Mr lab server\
      \ to make an appointment and push it to you, your friends and interested players.<br><br>Detailed\
      \ play method can pay attention to QQ group of laboratory community 739924481<br><br><br><strong>\
      \ Player benefits </strong><br><br>1. HereticOS MR LAB only contains programs,\
      \ not MOD. You need to participate in community activities to find MOD<br><br>2.\
      \ The laboratory itself is upgraded free of charge for life, with limited free\
      \ service content. Limited free services include free mod experience, queuing\
      \ for appointment when the server is free, etc.<br><br>3. Player mod can't contain\
      \ any pornographic content and bad information. The HereticOS Mr lab war simulator\
      \ is anti war, rendering people's hurt and pain caused by cruel war. Any content\
      \ with inconsistent ultimate goal will not be allowed to release mod<br><br><br><strong>\
      \ Brief introduction to the development background of the laboratory</strong><br><br><br><br>10000\
      \ people listen to bow and arrow rain, which is the basic demand index for 5g\
      \ experience such as MMORPG and Mr proposed in the early stage of the Internet\
      \ in 1998, which determines MMORPG Mr's basic experience quality, listening\
      \ to bow and arrow rain is a global dynamic interactive effect, which can only\
      \ be realized by single map and single server, and can't be expanded in a distributed\
      \ way. According to the plan, a battle in Chibi, a small-scale battle, requires\
      \ 400000 people to be online on the same screen, 5-20tbps bandwidth single map\
      \ server, which needs 50000 times of server bandwidth at that time. According\
      \ to Moore's law, it will take 50 years, but these 20 The annual performance\
      \ of the network server only increased by 2-5 times, which led to MMORPG only\
      \ giving up the world map, giving up the user's social interaction and opening\
      \ more copies, leading to the game transforming into the online krypton gold\
      \ stand-alone game, which eventually went to failure. Therefore, the realization\
      \ of 10000 people listening to the bow and arrow rain is expected to stay ahead\
      \ of the world for 30 years and achieve the only real-time war experience in\
      \ the world. At present, HereticOS OS Mr Lab for war simulator has been initially\
      \ formed. The output bandwidth of 65000 people on a single map and a screen\
      \ is 200g, which can realize the real-time battlefield of 10000 people listening\
      \ to the bow and arrow rain on a small scale. For example, the 2D online games\
      \ are generally the same as the map service 2000 units and the screen 200 units,\
      \ the field of vision is 50m, the 3D online games are the same as the map service\
      \ 800 units, the screen 50 units and the field of vision is 200m, while a typical\
      \ bow and arrow rain needs 1500m field of vision, and the archer 2 units More\
      \ than 10000 people listen to the effect of bow and arrow rain. At present,\
      \ the effect of bow and arrow rain will only appear in the movie works. For\
      \ example, the movie of Lord of the rings needs to serve 100000 units on the\
      \ same screen, with a vision of 6000 meters, and the same screen needs to accommodate\
      \ four scenes of bow and arrow rain. Therefore, the online game effect of the\
      \ movie of Lord of the rings will be the only experience in the world in 30\
      \ years"
