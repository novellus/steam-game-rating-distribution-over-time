    review: "It's intense. You don't get time to prepare, the enemies start spawning\
      \ after seconds, and you need to get moving.\nThe enemies are just the right\
      \ amount of bullet spongey to be difficult in groups larger than 6 or 7, but\
      \ not soft enough that you can just swat away one or two. \nThe soundtrack is\
      \ an energetic synth which I would consider using for a pleasant alarm in the\
      \ morning.\nThe chaos in this game gives it hours of play time just in trying\
      \ to learn the map's layout, and the common spawn points of the pills you need\
      \ to collect to keep going.\nIt's an endless game, so get ready to keep trying\
      \ to beat your best.\n\nSince originally writing this review, a new map has\
      \ been released as an option - which completely changed up how I played and\
      \ saw this game (for the better) by instead of being tight corridors was a wide\
      \ open area. \nDon't let that fool you, though, there are two new enemies trying\
      \ to get you to keep the intensity at max."
