But from what i can tell the developer does want to make it work so the promise of a polished game at the end of the tunnel is there.\n2) The gesture controls for the spells do feel clunky at times but they're super responsive and the only limitation in terms of casting speed is you from what i can tell. \n3) The unique mechanic of \"running in place\" to move your character is interesting, and I appreciate that the dev gave an option for artificial movement if thats not your thing. \n4) I was expecting a sort of \"defeat all waves\" kind of game when I booted it up liek any other VR game i've played so far, but i was pleasantly surprised that theres an actual campaign to it albeit still in its infancy. Kudos to dev for prioritizing SP content in a time where apparently \"no one plays SP games anymore\" lol.\n5) You can hide behind pillars and play peek-a-boo with the enemies!\n\nAll in all im quite pleased i made this purchase as it is my first VR game on steam! I always thought VR was gimmicky and just plain meh but Deplau proved me otherwise! anyways...in short, I feel that Deplau has great potential if give the right support from the Devs!\n\n","timestamp_created":1533216091,"timestamp_updated":1533216091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597183108329772949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4t52z/eQCere3pwE="}
