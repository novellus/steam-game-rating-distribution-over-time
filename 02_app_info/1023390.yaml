    about_the_game: People is a game where you control an island and the native population
      of people as an omnipotent being. Build villages and towns anywhere on this
      20 km island as you expand your influence and power. Assign different roles
      and tasks to your villagers in order to make your people grow and thrive. Explore
      the island and it's many mysteries as you complete quests, missions, play games
      and puzzles.<h2 class="bb_tag">Build</h2>Place buildings, structures and objects
      then instruct your people to build! You will unlock more buildings as you progress.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Gather</h2>Giving your people roles such as Food or Supplies
      will tell them to gather those supplies for the rest of your people.<h2 class="bb_tag">Breed</h2>The
      island is dangerous and there are many threats. Keep your population high to
      avoid extinction and see how many villagers you can cram onto the island.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Guard</h2>Protect your people from threats, assign guards and
      train soldiers to defend and attack.<h2 class="bb_tag">Worship</h2>You need
      magic to thrive as a powerful being. That magic comes from belief! Convert worshipers
      to gain additional magic and expand your influence.<h2 class="bb_tag">Interesting

      Something I personally like about this game is the ability to interact with
      everything. You can pick up trees for resources. Rocks for throwing. People
      for performing tasks (and throwing!). It is a very large island with a lot of
      places to explore and interact with. You can just build towns for hours or you
      can mess around and cause chaos. I will try to polish this game as soon as possible.
      It is very big undertaking and I would like to do this right!<br><br><strong><i>Info

    review: "The aesthetic of this game reminds me sooooo much of Black and White,\
      \ which is why I bought it. That being said I'm sad to see that the interest\
      \ in the game is waning. I'd love to see it expanded more. The gameplay is a\
      \ little rough but pretty straightforward. A basic tutorial would be nice but\
