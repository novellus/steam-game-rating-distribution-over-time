Addictively difficult and carefully designed levels make multiple playthroughs just as fun and awesome as the first.. They went for the good old, \"Easy to pick up, hard to master\" design and I should add, they go it so well.. I very much recommend this game to anyone who is a Platformer fan, a Casual game fan, a side-scroller fan.. Pretty much any gamer who likes games..","timestamp_created":1525246158,"timestamp_updated":1525246158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6zwj+MCeIq+nwE="}
