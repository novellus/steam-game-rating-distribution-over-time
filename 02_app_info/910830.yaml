      \ Outlaw takes place in a greasy, blue-collar world of outlaws, truckers, cops\
      \ and thieves. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrap into a variety of spacecraft, settle\
      \ a score in a filthy space-bar over a game of 8-ball, rock out to over 24 hours\
      \ of music, and engage in white-knuckle dogfights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the\
      \ Dodge Sector it\u2019s hard to get by \u2013 and even harder to get even.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nRebel Galaxy Outlaw is an open-world space combat adventure\
      \ game, spread across the nearly 40 systems of the Dodge Sector. Play as a mercenary,\
      \ a trader, a pirate, or whatever mix of the three you feel fits you best. With\
      \ an engaging storyline and a full conversation system, you can follow the narrative,\
      \ or ignore it and forge your own path at any time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEngage\
      \ in white-knuckle combat, and use the included Autopursuit function to effortlessly\
      \ fly like an ace, instead of space-jousting for hours. Save up your credits,\
      \ buy a new ship, kit it out, and then paint it in a fully-fledged 3d-painting\
      \ application. Make a fortune exploiting lucrative trade routes. Join guilds,\
      \ help or hunt those in distress, buy and outfit your own space station. Grab\
      \ a tip in a local bar and hunt hidden treasure. In your down-time, shoot some\
      \ 8-ball, play some dice-poker, or aim for the high-score in an arcade game\
      \ in the local seedy watering hole. Flip through the 7 included radio stations\
      \ and vast music library for just the right track to fit your current mood."
