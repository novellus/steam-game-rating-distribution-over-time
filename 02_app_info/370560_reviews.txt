Very casual.\nCute sounds and graphics, although the sounds might get annoying after a while.\nVery mobile-based gameplay (click on the coins above the buildings)\nNo micromanagement other than setting ticket prices and making sure you've got enough power, wifi, and pyrotechnics to go around.\nUpgradeable buildings, but a limited selection.\nOver 50 unique characters to unlock through regular progression.\nDidn't find any bugs.\nI think I paid less than $1 for this game, and I recommend getting it for under $2 if you are into easy, casual games that look nice and don't take much brainpower.","timestamp_created":1502406625,"timestamp_updated":1502406625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497285395860671997","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ria590CepWmggE="}
