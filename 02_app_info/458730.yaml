    review: "Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars is a Japanese role-playing\
      \ game, developed by Spike Chunsoft, released in April of 2014 for PlayStation\
      \ Vita and Nintendo 3DS. The Vita version was later ported to Windows via Steam,\
      \ and released on August 16, 2016. It is not connected to the previous game\
      \ in the series beyond gameplay mechanics and can be jumped into without any\
      \ prior knowledge.\n\n[h1]Livin' On A Prayer\u200B[/h1]\nThe story of Conception\
      \ II manages to be very concise during gameplay, whilst sounding incredibly\
      \ convoluted outside of that context, so keep that in mind during this section.\
      \ Human society is under constant duress as a result of monster attacks. These\
      \ creatures emerge from areas of the world called Dusk Circles, mysterious dungeon\
      \ formations that secrete dark energy. Prior to the start of the game's events,\
      \ humans have been unable to venture into these areas, as they simply didn't\
      \ have the ability to survive within them.\n\nHumanity is not without its defenses,\
      \ however. You see, the world is protected by the blessing of the Star God,\
      \ which imbues select members of the world's youth with star energy. Teenagers\
      \ who possess the mark of the Star God on their hand, a side effect of the blessing,\
      \ are forcibly gathered at academies located near the Dusk Circles in order\
      \ to contain the problem. Here we venture firmly into the territory in which\
      \ Conception comes into it's own. With this holy energy, a pair of male and\
      \ female students are able to undergo a ritual which has a chance to produce\
      \ Star Children, a chibi race of fighters capable of providing a great boost\
      \ to mankind's defensive. That process is called Classmating.\n\nYes, the name\
      \ of the core gameplay facilitating mechanic is a ridiculous pun, and the game\
      \ continues to embody a similar level of silliness from here on out. Still,\
      \ let's take a step back for a moment and take a look at the character who will\
      \ make the largest impact in the game's story. Our hero is a young man named\
      \ Wake Archus, who has only just arrived at such a school, just in time to thwart\
      \ the attack of a creature which had escaped the defensive boundaries, rescuing\
      \ two of his future friends in the process. Soon thereafter, by way of the routine\
      \ testing, Wake is discovered to be God's Gift, a student with an immense amount\
      \ Star Energy, making him capable of not only consistently producing offspring,\
      \ but exploring what had been previously unknown territory, the innards of the\
      \ Dusk Circles.\n\n\u200B[h1]Born To Be My Baby\u200B\u200B[/h1]\nSeparate to\
      \ dungeon exploration is the heart of the game, which resembles a visual novel\
      \ in structure. Wake's movements take the form of a list where the player chooses\
      \ a location or a character to visit, which allows the purchasing of items and\
      \ the progression of relationships. The most important of these characters are\
      \ the nine female students, which play into the Classmating mechanic. The heroines\
      \ become available for Classmating relatively soon after their introduction\
      \ into the story, leading to a rather uncomfortable exchanges and subsequent\
      \ cutscenes. The strength of each's bond with Wake is indicative of the strength\
      \ that the Star Child is capable of, raising it's potential skills and level\
      \ caps. Some heroines are more capable of creating particular classes than others,\
      \ of which there are as many as thirty-seven separate classes, leading to a\
      \ large variance of potential party members.\n\nThese characters are really\
      \ the soul of the game, as they each stand out in the limited context of the\
      \ game. Each is uniquely designed, and well differentiated in terms of personality.\
      \ It's genuinely entertaining to hear what each of them has to say as the relationships\
      \ progress. Your interactions are only limited at certain points of the game,\
      \ and these are lifted rather quickly as we continue to finish Dusk Circles,\
      \ allowing him to become closer with his potential mates, each of which was\
      \ given a character specific ending.\n\n\u200B[h1]I'll Be There For You\u200B\
      \u200B[/h1]\nSeparate to dungeon exploration is the heart of the game, which\
      \ resembles a visual novel in structure. Wake's movements take the form of a\
      \ list where the player chooses a location or character to visit, allowing him\
      \ to interact with his fellow students and further his bond with them. Only\
      \ those formed with the heroines can be truly increased, and they're used as\
      \ indicators of the strength and level potential of which the mother's Star\
      \ Children are capable of. As many as thirty-seven different classes are available,\
      \ with some being more easily attained based on the chosen lady, leading to\
      \ a staggering variety of possible party combinations.\n\nThese characters and\
      \ your interactions with them are the most interesting part of Conception. An\
      \ effort is made to see that all of them stand out in the admittedly limited\
      \ context of the game. Each are uniquely designed, and well differentiated in\
      \ terms of personality, and it's genuinely entertaining to hear what they have\
      \ to say as their relationships progress. Your interactions with them are limited\
      \ at certain points of the game, but these are gradually lifted as we continue\
      \ to explore the Dusk Circles.\n\n\u200B[h1]Bed Of Roses\u200B\u200B[/h1]\n\
      It's not always a great experience. One of the more annoying traits is the lack\
      \ of any form of time constraint on interactions, and honestly, the developers\
      \ really should've included some. Whilst it isn't advised, you could forego\
      \ interacting with the female students until the game's conclusion and still\
      \ manage to finish out every characters relationship arc without having to go\
      \ so far as to step into a dungeon. This lessens potential attachment to characters\
      \ that you might've chosen to spend time with of your own accord.\n\nI found\
      \ the dungeoneering gameplay to be lacking, as it was simply not engaging enough\
      \ to keep me invested. The game contains no additional difficulty settings,\
      \ and as it sits, is on the easy side with minimal grinding necessary to see\
      \ it to the finish. Beyond the initial play, I doubt the relationships would\
      \ provide much in the way of value for subsequent plays, as they really don't\
      \ contain any branching paths, meaning you'd be experiencing a very similar\
      \ story, regardless of your dialogue choices. Perhaps the lack of a limiter\
      \ is a blessing in disguise, as the game really doesn't have any replay value\
      \ to speak of. It provides you with a save point after the final battle so that\
      \ you can choose a different girl and experience their ending without forcing\
      \ you to replay an entire section of the game to do so, an appreciated gesture\
      \ for my money.\n\nConception II is far from perfect, and its thorns cut deep\
      \ by the time the credits roll, but it does provide some charm in it's own ludicrosity.\
      \ Aesthetically the game is very easy on the eyes, and it game has plenty of\
      \ fun with the concept's inherent quirkiness. It comes mildly recommended for\
      \ fans of visual novels and folks who enjoy relationship-values as a game mechanic,\
      \ but the gameplay may not hold the interest of veteran role-playing fans for\
      \ long. Have a nice day.\n\nTime Spent: 60 hours for one playthrough with all\
      \ Heroine conversations & all endings."
