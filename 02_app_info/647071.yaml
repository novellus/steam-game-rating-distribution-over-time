    review: "Rebel vs Imperium empowers militaristic play style and fleshes it out.\
      \ It introduces takeovers, which basically is invasion of player's planets.\
      \ Takeovers can be executed through takeover cards which you have to get via\
      \ the draw pile. Miltary count acts as offense and defense. A new 2-player scenario\
      \ has been added which let you start with one takeover card. Takeovers are optional\
      \ though, you can play without this mechanic. Note: R vs I requires Gathering\
      \ Storm.\n\nPros:\n+ Military strategies are now competitive \n+ Take over planets\
      \ from players\n+ New powerfull military cards >9 VP\n+ New synergies which\
      \ are theme based (rebel and imperium cards)\n+ Green cards (gene worlds) are\
      \ getting some love in terms of synergies (+Gene world goal)\n+ New goals\n\
      + New starting worlds and cards\n\nCons:\n- If you do not follow a military\
      \ build then you will encounter a lot of useless cards. This DLC adds a significant\
      \ amount of military cards to the game.\n- I feel that the AI doesn't make optimal\
      \ use of the new DLC mechanics as opposed to Gathering Storm."
