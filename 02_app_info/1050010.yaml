    review: "[h1]Even for Eternia is a great game with a solid story, interesting\
      \ combat mechanics, and compelling characters. Well worth the time invested\
      \ to experience this gem.[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zg4iUmLvhxk\n\nThis review\
      \ has been a long time coming. Mostly because I\u2019ve been waiting for quite\
      \ some time for this game to release officially. I\u2019m proud of what Arin,\
      \ the developer, has accomplished, and the ways he\u2019s improved the game\
      \ since I streamed it a while ago.\n\nThat said, this may not be considered\
      \ a wholly unbiased review. I\u2019m going off of a copy of the game that I\
      \ received before steam, and I\u2019m friends with the developer, sooooo consider\
      \ this your disclaimer.\n\nEven for Eternia follows the main character, Rubellum,\
      \ or Ruby for short, as she goes from loner in the woods to being of immense\
      \ power and potential darkness, an Umbra, who fights off others of her kind\
      \ who\u2019ve totally gone off the deep end. It\u2019s a solid story that focuses\
      \ on loss, mostly on one\u2019s memories, and the sacrifices one makes to protect\
      \ those they care about.\n\nBut it tends to go wrong. Horribly wrong.\n\nThe\
      \ thing I enjoyed the most about this game was when you realized something,\
      \ it hits you HARD, if you\u2019ve been following along with the game. When\
      \ the name makes sense, you realize just what a character has given up. And\
      \ for what? A world that reviles the Umbra. It\u2019s thankless, but Ruby and\
      \ her friends are hell bent on doing what\u2019s right.\n\nAnother major plus\
      \ is the crafting system. Each main area of the game has tiers of weapons that\
      \ you can craft by getting materials from combat. If you\u2019re struggling,\
      \ CRAFT NEW STUFF.\n\n+Excellent Story\n+Multiple crafted weapons and armor.\n\
      +Quick Party Swap in Combat.\n+Multiple strats for Combat to Win.\n\n=Wraith\
      \ Enemies.\n=Sometimes the story feels forced.\n=Crafting is your primary source\
      \ of income.\n\n-Crafted weapons are obsolete once you unlock factions.\n-Leveling\
      \ Factions = Lots of Grinding.\n-Some Characters Need more Story Agency."
