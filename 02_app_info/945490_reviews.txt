It takes me back to the past of PC puzzle-gaming in all the right ways too with plenty of personality, and the extra layers of polish and replay make this title well-worth a second look (or third, or fourthâ€¦) Recommended for anyone, especially if \"BoWEP\" means anything to you.","timestamp_created":1557890848,"timestamp_updated":1557890848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0Prh3OoCfeKbwQE="}
