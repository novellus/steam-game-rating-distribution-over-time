    about_the_game: C.I.A. Agent Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) brings his wife home
      to meet his absurdly dysfunctional family. Only Billy's not really in the C.I.A.,
      and his &quot;wife,&quot; Layla (Christina Ricci), is actually a young tap dancer
      he just kidnapped to impress his ridiculous and unloving parents (Anjelica Huston,
      Ben Gazzara). In reality, Billy's whole life is an empty lie. He's fresh out
      of prison and now on a deadly mission to hunt down and kill the Buffalo Bills
      kicker whose botched field goal, he believes, ruined his life. However, Billy's
      new hostage may ruin everything. Their crazy attachment blossoms into a desperate
      and oddly beautiful romance that may or may not be a sweet enough substitute
      for revenge.

    review: My favorite movie of all time. Vincent Gallo is iconic. Worth the buy.
