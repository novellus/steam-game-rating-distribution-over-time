    review: I wish this game was better. Overall skill makes no sense, for example
      how is Cotchin over 10 overall less than dusty. Players asking for stupid amounts
      of money for contracts so within one season you dont have a team. The rucks
      constantly winning the goal kicking. There was an 19 year old who had already
      played 400 games and kicked 700 goals. How can you charge anyone for this game
      when it is not complete. If the creator wants this game to be good just contact
      me and ill help them out for free. I just want a AFL game that is good. The
      last good one was in 2007. The game has a lot of potential I just think the
      developers need help with basic things that should be in the game.
