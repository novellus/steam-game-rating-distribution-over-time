    review: This is another wonderful underappreciated gem, the game is simple yet
      has a beautiful attention to detail, the gameplay is relaxing while still offering
      a challenge. I originally purchased the game when it was still in beta on the
      iphone after first trying and enjoying the developers previous mobile game "Rico",
      I believe. The release of Nub's Adventure on Steam pleasantly caught me by surprise
      offering me another change to experience this wonderful game on a larger screen
      and with achievements too. The game may start off slow and if your not paying
      attention you can loose track of where to go, but if you give this game the
      chance it deserves you will be rewarded with a truly unique and beautiful experience.
