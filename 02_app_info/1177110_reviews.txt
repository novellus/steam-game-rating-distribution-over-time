[/b]. There is no save system, The devs have issued several updates to the game addressing bugs and are moving on to their next game: Faceless\n\nThis game hooked me the minute I saw it. I wanted something I could play relatively quickly due to time constraints. In the notes the dev has estimated that gameplay is 45-60 minutes. \n\nI have about three hours into it, and have no idea how far in the game I am. I am a Point and Click/Adventure player; I look at [I] everything [/i] twice, maybe three times. I look for hidden clues where there are none at times.\n\nThere is so much to see in this game it would be a shame to finish it that quickly. I am not a “run through a museum” person, I casually stroll and appreciate art.\n\n+Artwork/Graphics\n+Atmosphere. So spooky\n+Music and sounds\n+Voice Actors\n+Story, though I cannot comment on the ending yet.\n+Replay that is not repetitive. \n\nThe game begins by plopping you directly into it; your nightmare journey begins now and it is a spooky one!\n\nI refuse to give away the game lore, but it is there.\n\nThere are a couple of jump-scares that are easy on the brain; I actually enjoyed them\n\nYou access settings via the escape key and adjust video quality, volume, and keyboard controls.\n\nYou navigate with the usual WASD keys, or a controller if you have one. You are given instructions along the way that teach you what you need to know, no guessing required.\n\nYes, you can die. You will come back....\n\nThe game does have higher system requirements so watch that. I have a friend testing on a lower spec machine.\n\nI have had no glitches thus far and it runs fine.\n\nAgain: There is no manual save option, buy it and commit to playing it.\n\nFor the $5.00 and change it cost I’m pleased with it. When I have a free day I will sit down and finish it!","timestamp_created":1591043357,"timestamp_updated":1608735762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620747864246368408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5fSHyPYCeYTTiwI="}
