    review: 'I played this game once. It was a cracked version back in the day. Come
      to think of this game again and wanted to see if it was on steam. And it is.
      But I have to admit that the cracked version worked better than this version.
      I can''t set my graphic settings. It gives me the message I need to restart
      the game for changes to take effect. But when I start the game the changes didn''t
      take place. Also the profile thing doesn''t work. Can''t create or delete a
      profile. And the previews of already completed projects doesn''t show the bridges
      I build. The cracked version however did do all those things. At least now I
      have payed for playing the cracked version back in the day. I don''t recommend
      buying this game on steam. Best look for the old DVD version somewhere. But
      for this little money I will still enjoy this game despite looking like 240p.


      A little addition. The game doesn''t save anything. So when i close the game
      and start it the next day i have to redo al the previous bridges i already passed.
      How can this steam version of the game be even worse than the original ? Gonna
      look if i can download this game somewhere else cause this is just unplayable.
      It''s becoming a trend here on steam. Same with Saint Row 4. Can''t play it
      anymore. And steam does nothing about it. No more games on steam for me !'
