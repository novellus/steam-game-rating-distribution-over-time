    review: 'TL/DR of the review: AI/CPU player Unadjustable and hyper aggressive,
      Lacks any descriptives, tutorial, or any helpful info on "How to Play" outside
      Store Page description, Bare Bones Options that are Inaccessible mid game (only
      resume or quit from pause) and what could have been an adorable and cute little
      puzzler Ruined by lack of updates, finicky menu input, and unclear gameplay
      guidelines.  Will re-review if this ever gets an actual update.



      From what I''ve seen so far, sadly I can''t really suggest this as an upstanding
      game at the time of writing this. Though I only have .4 hours in the game (again
      at time of review) but in that time I have this to say


      Positive:

      *Cute, simple graphics.

      *Functional sandbox to test interactions

      *Equally cute little bestiary telling little stories of each slimes personality

      *Endless play works smoothly


      Negatives:

      *Graphics might come off as too simple, and some in game graphics drop out during
      repeat game sessions

      *Arcade seems broken, and AI is too aggressive.

      *Options are super bare bones, and no options screen mid game to check/change.

      *Currently lacking updates, as last one was in 2018, listing potential exit
      of early access in 2019


      To Elaborate, Graphics on the front page are functional, but lack luster. The
      interaction with all the menu options also feel inconsistent and clunky due
      to the controls responding to mouse position AND keyboard, causing options to
      occasionally snap or glitch out due to the "sliding" tile main menu system.
      I will give credit, as the sand system works alright, but there''s very little
      suggestion, guidance, or anything.


      Next big plot point, the Arcade VS AI. I watched in arcade and noticed that
      after searching the handful of menu''s the game has, including the "Custom"
      game mode, there is no AI difficulty option. Upon starting up the game in Arcade
      vs AI The CPU player seems to erratically zig zag slimes back and forth, constantly
      spinning the pieces at top speed (aka holding down "DROP" button constantly)
      and racking up huge point totals before you even know what''s going on


      The game also has ZERO tutorial on how to play, no guide telling you how to
      play, and no tips giving any information on how the slimes interact with eachother.
      On one hand it gives an organic learning experience, and there is a "Sandbox"
      you can test interactions in, but unfortunately the game also has no details
      or summary on what any of the game modes are. A brilliant point to this is Sandbox
      I would figure might be a "zen mode" that would give you the game field from
      Arcade or Endless and let you play with the physics, test how the slimes bounce,
      and see how they pop and play off eachother in the "mixing" area below, but
      nope...it''s literally just a browser worthy, Literal "Sand Box" using the curser
      as a stylus to spawn in the sands.


      Most Notable gripe I have though is the Arcade mode (at least against AI as
      I haven''t tested local Vs.) Always considers the game mode High score wins.
      I played and kept losing to the CPU and never knew why, as I never "lost" as
      far as the store page described (aka sand peaking above the "fill line" or having
      slimes exceed the upper chamber) and yet always lost, because the CPU despite
      having overfilled it''s sand box, had an astounding point score on my gameplay.
      With it having no adjustments and the rules for Arcade being such, what should
      be a fun puzzle game boils down to who can spam the slimes the fastest to get
      high score.'
