    review: 'Bland graphics, boring and uninspiring gameplay and less than four tracks
      of music for the entirety of the game.


      2D sprites looks nice in static images, but animations are very basic and after
      an hour, all enemies variations will have been seen. The same goes for battle
      scenarios, there are about five different types and that''s it.


      Combat system is tedious. The main character attacks automaticly to the enemy
      on it''s front without input of the player, whose only job is to move it for
      one place to another avoiding hits and using "strong attacks" that recharge
      every few automated slashes for more damage. If it wasn''t for the slow paced
      movement, it could even be considered entertained for the first ten times.


      Music is just there, there is one track for the menus, another for the world
      map in "Story Mode" and another one for combat. That''s it. None of them are
      memorable or even fitting. After a while, it''s like and audio-torture.


      Story mode has it''s moments, but it''s hindered by the aforementioned points.
      There is also a wave mode, which is just combat after combat without the story.


      Achivements are extremely frustrating, specially the "Dark Legend" one, which
      consist on hundreds of repetitive combats.

      If it wasn''t because i like to have 100% completition in my games to the point
      of obsession, i would have removed this thing from my library long time ago.


      In my humble opinion, not worth it even for free. Can entertain for a few minutes
      and after that, it becomes a chore. There are better options to waste your finite
      time in this reality.'
