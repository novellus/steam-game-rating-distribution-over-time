There are 6 highly unique races, each with their own play style. The tech tree is fun and randomized each time. Ship design is simple but very enjoyable. Space battles are the best part, leading your carefully designed fleet to victory. Lasers and cannons and missiles, shields and cloaking and boarding pods and tractor beams, gauss cannons and fighters, the possibilities are vast.","timestamp_created":1319503971,"timestamp_updated":1385422852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+uHoyMICf+mdBA=="}
