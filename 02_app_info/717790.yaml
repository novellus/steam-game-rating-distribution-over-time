      \ is about finding yourself stranded on an island and fighting the elements,\
      \ gathering resources and seeing if you have what it takes. You might encounter\
      \ hunters and animals that you'll have to fight with to claim resources and\
      \ expand building capabilities. Since launching, we've added quests in single-player\
      \ and a NEW multiplayer mode without quests. <br><br>We wanted to make a survival\
      \ game that\u2019s not about feeling like you are on the verge of dying, while\
      \ fighting off and defending your base. In Hold Your Own it\u2019s easier to\
      \ find food and water, but AI is harder to kill and coming after you. We want\
      \ players to have fun, build their base so they can spend their time on fun\
