      /><br><br><i>Paws &amp; Effect: My Dogs Are Human!</i> is a quirky-comedy visual
      novel that is brimming with the kind of obsessive love that only pets inspire!
      Play as Sadie (name customizable), an aspiring lawyer whose life hurls headfirst
      into chaos when her two dogs (names also customizable) suddenly transform into
      people! Guide Sadie through this harrowing ordeal, but beware: Mysterious figures
      lurk in the shadows, monitoring your every decision! <br><br>What will Sadie
      teach the dogs about being human? What will she learn about the realities of
      canine existence? And who is behind all of these shenanigans? Across a branching
      3-5 hour romp, discover the answers to these questions, and maybe a few others

    review: 'This game is very humorous at times, the dialogue is very well written,
      and it''s a pretty fun experience overall. The art is very cute, I also liked
      the voicing and music.

      The plot in the long run was weird, and though plenty about the game was enjoyable
      none of the endings really satisfied. So much of the game feels really neat
      and refined but for some reason, after playing through it completely I feel
      like the game was a little shallow.

      Since I did purchase this on sale it was very much worth the price, and I would
      recommend it to anyone looking to play something light and silly.'
