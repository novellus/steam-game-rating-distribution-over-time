The paths are simple and follow your stats of might magic stealth and speech to put it simply. Aside from being incredibly simple with no plot twist or weighty decisions it also overly masculinizes women, while minor compared to the problem of it being incredibly basic it's a poor choice that takes away rather than adds quality to the story. \n\nIf you just want something to pass the time with this may be a purchase for you, but if you have limited time and are looking for a good adventure I'd pass on this one.","timestamp_created":1584554195,"timestamp_updated":1584554195,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.44871792197227478","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g8ey9/ACft2D+QE="}
