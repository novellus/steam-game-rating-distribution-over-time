    developer_response: "Hi! You can actually increment the pages: If you rotate the\
      \ content in a library with the rotate left/right buttons, it will increase\
      \ a page after one 360 degree turn to the right, and decrease after one turn\
      \ to the left - I really need to put that in the tutorial ;) Also, Search should\
      \ be functional... if you have some time, please let me know if you're using\
      \ Oculus or Vive, and what library you're trying to search and I'll figure out\
      \ what's going on there. \n\nThanks for the good review! \n\n-Laura Lynn (10k\

    review: Played with the few basic things available and had some fun. Would be
      great to be able to search, see beyond page 1, etc, but I guess that is for
      the future!
