Quite similar to what Watanabe has done recently with Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Along with antagonists and music that seem like they inspired the creator of Inuyasha. Quite a few cheesy lines to rival an 80's action movie. It doesn't hold back on the blood but it doesn't reach the grittyness of material like Berserk. A great movie as long as you don't mind the unrealistic depiction of ninjas (they're more like unrealistic samurai anyways.)","timestamp_created":1475083414,"timestamp_updated":1475083414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.742266654968261719","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn9X0uNcCcOSZYg=="}
