    review: 'Complete TRASH.  The lack of effort put into this cheap RPG maker game
      is obvious.  Avoid at all costs!

      My Score:  A big fat ZERO.  Oh, and my award goes out to the developer.  ..Congratulations
      on making my infamous M.I.S.S. series on Youtube!  - What a great feeling that
      truly must be and I''m sure you are very proud!'
