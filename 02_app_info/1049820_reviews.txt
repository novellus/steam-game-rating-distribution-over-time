It can be fun for a couple of hours, but not more.\n\nIn fact, the gameplay is very simple: You and your opponents run in circles around the map (similar to Speedrunners). You need to get the other players out of the screen by being faster than them. In order to do so, you can use different items as for example boosts, guacamole to make them slip, burrito-rockets, etc.\n\nThe graphics are rather simple, but acceptable.\n\nAll in all, not a great game…","timestamp_created":1595629862,"timestamp_updated":1595629862,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx++8wfMCe7StlwI="}
