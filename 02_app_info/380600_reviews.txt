It is \"free\" to download..... but, it is a \"pay to play\" sim!!!  I am very unhappy with this. Yes, it is visually pretty and realistic but in order to have real fun you have to keep dishing out money (so to speak). Very frustrating. The fishing games from Fishing Sim World do not have this same approach. I am considering DELETING Fishing Planet!!!","timestamp_created":1609431939,"timestamp_updated":1609431939,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+87n3PYCfsySvwI="}
