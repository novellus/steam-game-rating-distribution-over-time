All of this is now useless, because something happened to the game and everyone's characters lost ALL their skills progress. If you logged in within a week after it happened, you were given some tomes to redo it all, but I missed that week and besides, playing as a healer is way too much of a chore to REDO EVERYTHING. I just logged in to check and I literally have a CS1 healer standing there with literally no skills in the kung fu menu. Everything has to be rebought, then relearned then retrained in the field. Uninstalling this rubbish right now!\n\nAvoid this game. If you even manage to open an account, there is absolutely no guarantee that your character is safe. You can literally lose all your progress out of the blue and have nothing to show for it. You've been warned!\n\nEdit: shouldve listen to my own advice and stay away. My high level character had their skills wiped along with everyone else's during a skills rework. The new skills give +-0.03 xp at level 1, so no ways that a skill will ever max out, even with the highly limited in game trainer. The game mechanics have died horribly.","timestamp_created":1487405847,"timestamp_updated":1564943685,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.430642217397689819","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42LL6ruwCe+65cg=="}
