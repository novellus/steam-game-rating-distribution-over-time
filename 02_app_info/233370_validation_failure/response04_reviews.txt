Great game! Just finished it, and I loved the ending. You will NOT see it coming.\n\nPeople like to complain about bugs, but those same people probably complain about a lot of things. Yes, there are a few bugs, but they are so minor that it shouldn't keep you from playing this game. Graphical/animation glitches are the most common, and I ran into one game-breaking bug, but you can get past it easily. Check the forums. It has to do with a \"doctor not giving you a bullet\". If that happens, you will be walking around the boat, having done everything possible and thinking you missed something. You didn't. Just reload the autosave and talk to him again and this time he will give it to you. It's most likely caused by some alternate pathway to a solution that was never finished and somehow remained in the game. That's it, tho. Autosaves are plentiful, so even if a graphical glitch makes your character disappear (this happened twice), you can reload to a point not too far back, or just keep clicking around the screen until your character glitches back in again lol.\n\nDon't let those bugs stop you. They're rare, and this is a lengthy game. This is one of the best point and click adventure games I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1608993781,"timestamp_updated":1608993781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Jbgz/YCeeSzvQI="}
