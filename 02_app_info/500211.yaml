    about_the_game: "Stretching across North and East London, the Gospel Oak to Barking\
      \ Line \u2013 affectionately known as the \u2018GOBLIN\u2019 \u2013 has grown\
      \ into a major part of the extensive London Overground network; a network which\
      \ has specialised in re-vitalising neglected routes throughout the Capital,\
      \ converting them into railways which are fit to serve a modern-day city. Explore\
      \ the railways in the north of the Capital with the North London &amp; Goblin\
      \ Lines Route Add-On for Train Simulator.<br><br>The Gospel Oak to Barking Line\
      \ was formed from an amalgamation of routes built in the 19th Century; the Tottenham\
      \ and Hampstead Junction Railway, which opened in 1868 and spanned North London\
      \ from Highgate Road to Tottenham North Junction; and the Tottenham and Forest\
      \ Gate Railway, which first saw trains in 1894 and connected Tottenham to the\
      \ existing line at Barking. Various stations have played as the terminus for\
      \ each end of the line, including St. Pancras, Kentish Town, Moorgate, East\
      \ Ham, Barking, Tilbury and Southend (the latter two being for specials only),\
      \ however, the line came to Gospel Oak in 1981, and has stayed between there\
      \ and Barking since.<br><br>Due to the GOBLIN\u2019s route being a very indirect\
      \ one into and out of London, it was pencilled in for closure under the infamous\
      \ Beeching Report. By chance, very little of the Capital\u2019s proposed changes\
      \ took place, and the line itself escaped the axe. Even with the line remaining\
      \ open, much of it suffered from poor maintenance and reliability would suffer\
      \ greatly, trains not built to cope with the commuter demand were forcibly in\
      \ service across the line, and all platform staff soon disappeared. Only one\
      \ train per hour was operating by 1980, not ideal as an East-to-North connection.<br><br>Improvements\
      \ would start to roll in with privatisation, National Express\u2019 Silverlink\
      \ introduced newer Class 150 DMUs across the line in 2000, along with CCTV and\
      \ Information Points, all of which gave a great boost to reliability. It wouldn\u2019\
      t be until Transport for London took over though, that major developments would\
      \ be seen and brand new, purpose-built rolling stock would arrive. By 2007,\
      \ the line was operated by London Overground and new services were added at\
      \ peak hours, weekend &amp; evenings, platform staff were reinstated, the line\
      \ was included as part of the Oyster Card system and added to the Tube Map.<br><br>In\
      \ 2010, an 8-strong fleet of new Class 172 \u2018Turbostar\u2019 DMUs entered\
      \ service, replacing the Class 150s and providing more comfortable and spacious\
      \ journeys throughout. Despite this however, even these new Turbostars were\
      \ not enough to meet capacity demands, and TfL began looking at longer DMUs\
      \ that could replace them. Before an order was settled however, it was announced\
      \ that the GOBLIN would be electrified, making diesel obsolete. <br><br>Since\
      \ June 2016, extensive work has started to erect 25kV AC overhead catenary over\
      \ the GOBLIN. Everything from track lowering, bridge rebuilding, platform lengthening\
      \ and much more is required to ready the line for new electric services; the\
      \ line was partially closed until September 2016, and has been fully closed\
      \ since. Services are set to begin once again in February 2017, and with further\
      \ evening and weekend works, the GOBLIN will be fully electrified by the end\
      \ of the year, ready for a fleet of brand new 4-car Class 710 \u2018Aventra\u2019\
      \ EMUs to take over from the Class 172s in 2018.<br><br>The Gospel Oak to Barking\
      \ Line has had some tough calls in its past, but has risen from strength to\
      \ strength in recent years, thanks to the projects of London Overground, and\
      \ is today a major commuter route for those in North &amp; East London that\
      \ is set to only improve in the future.<br><br>The North London &amp; Goblin\
      \ Lines for Train Simulator is a stunning recreation of the North London Line\
      \ (between Richmond and Stratford), GOBLIN (between Gospel Oak and Barking)\
      \ and the West London Line (between Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction),\
      \ all operated by London Overground Rail Operations Ltd. When combined with\
      \ the various freight connections and locations, the North London &amp; Goblin\
      \ Lines easily boasts more than forty-miles-worth of suburban railway to explore.<h2\
