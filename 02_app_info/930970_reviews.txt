Clearly great thought has gone into the puzzle aspects, but for me, on the oculus rift, I felt it needed more polish. The graphics were indeed cute overload but the cat noises drove me to insanity. An excellent first foray into VR games development but ultimately just not that fun.  It has the potential for satisfaction to be baked into the game mechanics but this hasn't been acted upon. I can't recommend this as it stands but I hope it get's improved and I'd be happy to revisit it.
