    review: 'It certainly is unique! I liked the game quite a bit, though it''s better
      suited to a mobile platform to pick up and play for a few matches.


      The sound and graphics are a real treat, and do benefit from the PC platform.
      The difficulty is a bit high in my opinion, and difficulty settings would be
      appreciated.


      All in all, a solid tactical game.'
