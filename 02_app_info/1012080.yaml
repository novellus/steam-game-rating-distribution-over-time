      \ authentic LMS Stanier Class 8F for Train Simulator!<br><br>With the grouping\
      \ of railway companies to form the \u201CBig Four\u201D, the new London Midland\
      \ and Scottish Railway found itself with a fleet of inadequate freight locomotives\
      \ from the former Midland Railway, which had all been built under their \u201C\
      small engine policy\u201D. Evidently, a new design was required, and chief engineer\
      \ Sir William Stanier was soon put to the task.<br><br>Ultimately, Stanier derived\
      \ the new freight locomotive from his proven, mixed-traffic \u201CBlack 5\u201D\
      , switching from a 4-6-0 to a 2-8-0 wheel configuration to achieve a higher\
      \ tractive effort. This made the new locomotives unsuitable for passenger locomotives\
      \ as their overall top speed was reduced, but their ability to haul freight\
      \ is what mattered most, and with a power rating of 8 (out of a possible 9),\
      \ they were about to change the industry.<br><br>In total, a massive 852 LMS\
      \ 8F locomotives would be built between 1935 and 1946, and not just for the\
      \ LMS themselves, the design was chosen as the standard freight locomotive to\
      \ be produced during the Second World War, meaning they were built and put to\
      \ use across the country. The LNER had enough of them to even give them their\
      \ own classification, the LNER O6, and the War Department wanted locomotives\
      \ for the British Expeditionary Force \u2013 as such, many 8F were sent to work\
      \ overseas in mainland Europe and beyond.<br><br>The 8Fs would continue operation\
      \ right into the British Railways era, and lasted until the very end of steam,\
      \ with most being retired in 1967 and 1968. Despite their huge numbers, only\
      \ 14 survived into preservation, 6 of those in the UK, and only half of those\
      \ have seen use since their retirement. However, with Bossman Games\u2019 LMS\
      \ Stanier 8F, you can relive this freight-hauling classic in fully authentic\

    review: 'The visual detail, options, and physics are excellent, but the model
      is somewhat let down by its exhaust sound.

      It has a disjointed sound in the 20-30mph range.


      For the positives:

      - The locomotive is realistic in its steaming performance. It requires careful
      management to maintain boiler pressure, unlike most other locomotives in the
      TS marketplace. Its performance drops with boiler pressure in a realistic way
      too.

      - The Bossman cab view camera locations are the best out there.


      Some negatives:

      - On the F5 HUD, the Blower, Damper, and Small Ejector readings are all unrelated
      to the actual state of the model.

      - The model is more demanding of computer resources than other Pro locomotives
      on the market - even when running in ''Performance'' mode. Exceed the TS recommended
      computer spec''s if you want to use this locomotive.


      This is my first Bossman Pro Locomotive purchase.

      I own Pro locomotives from both Victory Works and Just Trains.

      Every locomotive has its own unique pros and cons - it would be nice if they
      could all get together with the best bits of each!'
