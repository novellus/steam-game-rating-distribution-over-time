    review: Love the paint schemes and they look amazing but I'm very sad in the 1
      day waiting period... I mean for a paint scheme on a ship? really? I wish I
      could put one on a ship without having to worry because it sucks when you just
      put a paint scheme on a ship than you lose with in an hour and now you're stuck
      waiting to repaint a ship for a whole day. I get it with the DLC ships but I
      don't think it should apply with the paints.
