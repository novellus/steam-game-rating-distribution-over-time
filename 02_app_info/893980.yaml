    review: It's just a cool little book with all 240 of the game's Kanji written
      in it. It shows how each Kanji looks when it's written, when it's printed, it's
      English meanings and it's Kun'yomi and On'yomi readings (though these are in
      Romaji, so if you prefer the readings to be in Hiragana/Katakana you're out
      of luck). You definitely don't need it, but if you have a few dollars spare
      then it's a cool thing to have and reading through it makes for some nice revision.
