    review: The concept is great, I just think some of the decisions regarding the
      rules were made without proper consideration. For instance, if you attempt to
      play an illegitimate word, there is no punishment. When I play online I feel
      like my opponents are either cheating or abusing this mechanic. It takes some
      of the fun away.
