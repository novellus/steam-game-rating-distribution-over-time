    review: 'Project Solarbot feels like a love letter to Super Metroid. When I picked
      it up, I hadn''t played Super Metroid; something I soon would rectify. In fact,
      I found myself enjoying Project Solarbot a lot more after doing so -- the game
      isn''t quite as accessible to a complete newcomer to the genre as I''d wish,
      but going in knowing the basic rules of a Metroid game, you''ll feel right at
      home.


      This continues to be a theme, at least for me. The game constantly has you running
      and on edge, because the solar energy mechanic is no joke; it''s basically a
      strict timer on your travels, especially once you dive deeper into the innards
      of the planet. Personally, I found this a tad aggravating, as I like to explore
      at my leisure, but I know what Metroid speed runs look like and I think in *that*
      context, the system adds a nice spicy motivation to get faster and faster.


      The atmosphere on the other hand, is top-notch. The musical score constantly
      manages to sound ominous and a bit lonely. It''s my highlight of the game.


      Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to Metroid fans, especially
      if you like optimization of your travels.


      One last note: It might be obvious from my constant comparisons to Metroid,
      but do yourself a favor and play this game with a good D-Pad. I found controllers
      like the 8bitdo SN30 (a SNES inspired gamepad) to enhance my experience a lot,
      whereas mxy old 360 gamepad downright frustrated me.'
