    review: 'really fun game; love the hilariously stern umpire voice. heres where
      i struggle; what i do intuitively is to hit the ball when its at arms length
      in front of me; but to set the direction of the ball you need to hold down the
      hit button and move the blue dot located cross court with your Left Stick to
      choose where it''ll land; once you hold down the hit button ur character can
      no longer move; so i find myself having to predict ahead of where the opponent
      is gna hit, and run to there, and hold the hit button to set the little blue
      dot, then finally release the button to hit, given i had predicted correctly
      and the ball lands in front of me; but most time my position is slightly off
      and the ball fly past me a couple feet out of my reach.


      the dev has actively reached out to me and has said they will be making adjustments
      to the difficulty. i have every ounce of hope and confidence that this game
      with continue to grow better from my interactions with the dev.'
