But the game grew on me as I payed on and I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. At least until the third chapter, that is, where I feel several puzzles were not very well designed. I think the worst aspect of the game is the way you move, you have to hold the left mouse button while turning which is very clunky. The story is quite interesting though. Sound is decent. Puzzles are neither too hard nor too easy for the most part.\nAll in all I recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1609966242,"timestamp_updated":1609966242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjend7PYCd9eNwQI="}
