The feel blend compared to the rest of the game's presentation\n- The difficulty of some stage is crushing. I guess there were some of these in Megaman games as well. They're meant to go back to after you've acquired some weapons and upgrades. I like a challenge so I don't mind\n- No Steam Achievements :(\n\n=+- Conclusion -+=\nThis game would be a perfect successor to Megaman X. The different powerups and tough ennemies promote a smart playstyle.\n\nNOTE: I'd start with \"Mystic Mage\" to get the boots if I were you. They help alot!","timestamp_created":1536288168,"timestamp_updated":1536409751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43YnK3OUCdbuVqgE="}
