    about_the_game: "The world of Heavy Gear Assault is unforgiving \u2014 but so\
      \ is your lust for glory. As a pilot on the distant planet Terra Nova, you play\
      \ the high-stakes game of competitive Gear Dueling. You earn fame and fortune\
      \ by making a name for yourself on the arena floor. You stand out from the crowd\
      \ by customizing the look and style of your Gear. You manage corporate sponsors,\
      \ hire a support staff and fine-tune your Gear's performance in the Gear Bay.\
      \ You rise to the top, claim your position \u2014 and with every cannon shell\
      \ left in your magazines, you refuse to let go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeavy Gear\
      \ Assault puts you in control of a multi-ton, humanoid war machine better known\
      \ as a Gear. The peak of Terra Novan engineering, Gears feature a Rotary V-Engine,\
      \ an advanced, compact and highly efficient internal combustion engine. For\
      \ faster speeds, Gears are equipped with a Secondary Movement System (SMS) in\
      \ the form of either wheels or treads under their feet. Armored with advanced\
      \ composites and loaded with an assortment of weapons, Gears are the most advanced\
      \ weapon platform available on Terra Nova.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is up to you\
      \ to manage and maintain your Gears on the arena floor and off. Customize, upgrade,\
      \ and equip yours Gears exactly how you like. In combat, you\u2019ll need to\
      \ balance hydraulic and electric power to keep your Gear moving. Just remember,\
      \ whether you eviscerate your enemy with relentless firepower or put a precision\
      \ VibroKatana blade in their back, be sure to do it with style. After all, that's\
      \ what your fans paid to see.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINCLUDES: <br />\r\nHeavy Gear\
