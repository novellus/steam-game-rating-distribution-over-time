You start the career modes first season with a 600cc bike before getting to the 1000cc's, so keep that in mind. Once you have this pack in your library, it will open in the game and you have to pick a bike to apply the booster parts to at that point. My experience with this pack is as described below:\n\nIf it's possible, I would suggest starting your Career first BEFORE buying this and then buy the Pro Newcomer Pack after you pick your starting 600cc bike and team. For example with what happened to me, I picked the Kawi 636 for parts with my newcomer pack at the start, but the 636 didn't have a team to start with and I ended up choosing the Honda CBR 600 at the start with the booster parts going to a bike I can't use for the competitive events. To me, this pack was wasted and I am unable to change it to a different bike or buy a second pack. However, you are going to lose a lot in the first and second season anyway, so don't stress on making a mistake like I did.\n\nI got this pack in a bundle, but I kind of wish I would have waited to buy this until I bought the 1000cc bike I wanted later in the game. However, I'm not sure if it will allow the pack to apply to a 1000cc bike or if the booster pack only works for the 600cc bikes.","timestamp_created":1602869714,"timestamp_updated":1602869714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624946415424346924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxduemfUCeLWfqAI="}
