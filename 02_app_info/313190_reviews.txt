Appears you are using an Apache to defend one island from a dictator. And then taking the fight to him. Considering he has at least one aircraft carrier, several different types of aircraft (I think I saw MiG-29s, Raptors, A-10s, F-117s, and some old-school prop bombers), and a lot more… this is one wealthy dictator indeed… Each mission only gives you a limited amount of ammunition. Which can be a problem at times.\n\nSlightly older graphics, too. Decent enough, though.","timestamp_created":1598013361,"timestamp_updated":1598013361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tpnBiPQCf6fpnAI="}
