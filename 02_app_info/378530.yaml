    about_the_game: '<img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/378530/extras/NZA_GorrilaAnimatedGif.jpg?t=1572544302"
      /><br><br>Humans have succumbed to a Zombie plague. Desperate to prevent their
      extinction, animals have been forced to take what weapons remain and fight the
      undead. Great bears and enraged elephants wield everything from swords to freeze-rays
      in a chaotic crusade to ensure their survival. Play as an animal as you battle
      with friends against the apocalypse, whilst taking the time to protect penguins
      and rescue cute kitties.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/378530/extras/NZA_animals.png?t=1572544302"
      /><br><br>In Nature''s Zombie Apocalypse the animals are in charge and will
      stop at nothing to regain the world they once knew. To help them, each animal
      has a rage move that is uniquely adapted to obliterate the undead. When raging
      each animal intensifies their attack on the zombies, the duck sucks them into
      a tornado, the elephant charges through the hordes sending them flying. To help
      the main players, smaller animals can be strategically put down as defences,
      these are useful tools so place your suicidal snails and firing flamingos carefully!<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Chaotic hoards of undead zombies will run anywhere and jump over anything
      in order to feast on your flesh. They have many tricks to stop you, from vomiting
      toxic liquid, to turning their heads into bombs and launching them at you. Get
      past a few waves of these minions and you will be confronted by far greater
      enemies, such as angry dinner ladies, crazy clowns and even more fearsome foes.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/378530/extras/NZA_Egg.png?t=1572544302"
      /><br><br>Simply surviving in this game will take great skill, but there are
      lots of other challenges to test yourself. Team up with other players and help
      the eagle protect her eggs from the clutches of the undead, protect a group
      of penguins from peril or block zombies from crossing the bridge you are defending.

    short_description: Animals are the heroes in this hilariously quirky zombie shooter.
      Elephants with miniguns and sloths with flamethrowers are just a few of the
      crazy combinations available to take on the undead. Gaming with your friends
      has never been so much fun!
