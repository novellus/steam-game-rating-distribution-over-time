Not really a fan.  Match three games are usually relaxing as turn-based strategy with a bit of RNG thrown in. Even worse is the game does nothing to explain its mechanics or systems.  It seems that this is a game where the dev is learning the Unity engine and I wish them well.  However I would suggest a tutorial in a future version, even if it is just some static screens explaining the basics of matching, attacking, powering up skills, healing your fighters, how enemies attack, etc.  \n\nMight give it another shot with some updates, but can't recommend it in its current state.","timestamp_created":1531060966,"timestamp_updated":1531060966,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629892587661743164","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp4qWveQCebHIpQE="}
