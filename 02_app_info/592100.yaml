    review: "Eh, feels like a good start but abandoned :( \n\nVisuals are great and\
      \ a good throw-back to Homeworld. Ship positioning is good and intuitive but\
      \ selecting special abilities feels odd. Camera control bad to non-existing:\
      \ you can only move up or down or wonky-teleport, making it impossible to play\
      \ in standing area only. For example, some ships got catapulted *really* far\
      \ away, probably due to a physics bug, and I was unable to reach them because\
      \ they were located past the walls of my room.\n\nThere is also no menu or options\
      \ to leave a mission. I don't get it, the VR controllers have a dozen buttons\
      \ or so on them and displaying a menu on top of them is de-facto standard. This\
      \ would solve all issues.\n\nThere are a 100 missions in this game and they\
      \ seem well designed. However, this is more of a tactical puzzle game with only\
      \ 2-5 ships per side. No campaign or similar."
