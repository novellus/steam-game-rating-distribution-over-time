    review: "This game came out in Early Access with a modest price point and hopes\
      \ for the future. When I first played it, the story line was short and the grind\
      \ to get things unlocked was massive. I did figure it out and put in the time\
      \ to get a good chunk of my farm up and running: 5 sets of plots, 3 chickens,\
      \ 2 cows, fishing and gathering all unlocked. \n\nThen, they added ... multiplayer?\
      \ but weird and awkward?\nThen, they added ... in-app purchases. \n\nSo cute,\
      \ great potential, but an entirely one-button interface (everything you do in\
      \ the game is a mouse click, this game was made for a touch screen) and so little\
      \ focus on developing a story followed by asking me to spend more money on a\
      \ not completed product have led me to wonder, for my first time ever on Steam,\
      \ how do I ask for a refund?"
