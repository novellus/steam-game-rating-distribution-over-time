    review: "[u] Summary: [/u]\nSolid but not spectacular is the name of the game\
      \ with Kero Blaster. You can tell that the guy who created Cave Story is behind\
      \ it with the art style in question, but it never hits the same level of charm\
      \ or story that that game did. It's originally an IOS game that feels more at\
      \ home here, with simple controls but solid gameplay that relies on good level\
      \ design and basic weaponry to propel it forward. What it doesn't have is anything\
      \ that hits you in the mouth, aka the knockout punch to really sell the game,\
      \ as it's solid in most aspects, but not great in any one either. Some elements\
      \ have problems with boss fights that let down and an overall sense of having\
      \ played the game before, but for a title to pick up on sale, it will bring\
      \ back some memories of Cave Story while you play through it, and it is enjoyable.\
      \ Just don't expect Cave Story 2.\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review:\
      \ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0zlBJWN3Xw[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n\
      [list]\n[*] Strong level design adds to the game's variety over time and helps\
      \ the simple mechanics succeed thanks to enemy placement and rearranging of\
      \ hazards.\n[*] Simple straight forward gameplay that feels polished, and doesn't\
      \ go overboard in any one way. Feels like most pieces fit together with no issues.\
      \ \n[*] Difficulty curve is solid as there's a solid progression of it throughout\
      \ the game, never having large gaps or peaks of difficulty, but a solid rise\
      \ of it. \n[*] Controls feel at home here as opposed to the iOS.\n[*] Gun variety\
      \ is simple but rewards smart use of each gun type and different gameplay styles.\
      \ \n[*] You'll get some nostalgia for those who played Cave Story by the feel\
      \ of the game.\n[*] Jumping takes a bit to get used to for some of the more\
      \ tricky jumps, but it does settle down once you get an understanding of what\
      \ the game is going for.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Some boss fights\
      \ miss badly being basically regular enemies with nothing really new to show\
      \ for it.\n[*] Audio options missing, and screen resolution options are really\
      \ non existant. Even for a mobile port, it doesn't really do a good job of playing\
      \ to the Steam strengths.\n[*] Some jumps go for the extreme limit of jump height,\
      \ leading no room for error, and frustration sets in.\n[*] Those Expecting Cave\
      \ Story 2 in terms of charm and story will need to look away, as it never hits\
      \ that level.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding\
      \ games I've reviewed, visit my curator. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix\
