    about_the_game: The chronicles of Anar have long told the legend of a mystical
      sword, and its accompanying shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants
      of Anar for many centuries. The sword and shield were supposedly guarded by
      the ancient Corsarians, but their existence, and possible whereabouts are now
      purely part of folklore.<br><br>The evil wizard Suzar has assembled a fighting
      force of mutated humanoids and plunged the kingdom into a state of fear. An
      entire army of brave warriors has already perished at the hands of the wicked
      wizard, and only with the combined power of the legendary sword and shield is
      it possible to defeat the dark forces that are suffocating the land.<br><br>Having
      been summoned before King Darius and the High Council of Anar, you and five
      other loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted sword and shield, and destroy
      Suzar before he is able to amass an army large enough to enslave Anar, and the
      rest of the world...<br><br>...and so you come to team up with motley band of
