The concept is simple, yet very addicting. Grab chests, match them with keys, get points, WIN!\n-Controls. Treasure Stack works best with a controller, and it works well. The buttons are simple, and there aren't a lot of complicated moves to remember.\n-Local Multiplayer. The chaos of you and 3 friends running around trying to survive the longest is a lot of fun.\n\nCons:\n-Simplicity. Some may find this a bad thing. There's not a lot more to this game than what I described, and while it's a blast, some may want more from their games.\n\nMeh:\n-Price. This is a fun game, but some may find it a little expensive for what you get. Definitely worth it if you like puzzle games.","timestamp_created":1551497076,"timestamp_updated":1555636689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563549160957336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hoPLmeoCdseLvAE="}
