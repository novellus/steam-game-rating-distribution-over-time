It says something along the lines of: why does she hold the umbrella & she replies because I have a raincoat. \nThat is a beautiful way of stating 'perception' since the girl's mentality is: she cannot see a way beyond the rain so she accepts it & lives with it - a perfect allegory of a state of mind or mental state. \n\nA final example being a girl who sits by a Lotus flower waiting for it to blossom who is asked why she waits? This isn't immediately clear until we see the outcome for the girl. \nNow this could be interpreted as meaning 'patience offers reward' or a direct allegory of having the desire to perservere. \n\nThis is the journey you can expect from Brain 43℃ and it is clever in its design because no one person can really interpret the same way.\n\nIf you are interested in art & philosophy this project can offer you a short experience to revel in that. It offers reflection in many ways, I say this because I think many things can make you reflect not only through philosophy but also in a song's lyrics & sound, artwork in its colour and subject or a good novel/movie/drama.\n\nUsually I would recommend Brain 43℃ for its originality and its messages but I think until it is improved upon with the following suggestions I can't recommend it just yet.\n\n[i]Suggestions to improve are[/i]: I feel it is held back by what a 'Gamer' expects and the main thing that stands out is the price which I personally feel is too high for what this artistic endeavour offers. There are others on Steam similar to this for a fraction of the price so this will deter many from taking a chance on this project.\n\nThe lesser issues that will be spotted by 'Gamers' is the unusual choice to have the 'player' have to delete the save-data from their directory folder to replay it which involves 'effort' and let's be honest the least 'effort' needed for the 'player' the more likely it will be enjoyed.\n\nFinally, there are some minor misspellings BUT considering this was designed & written with English as a second language I feel it can be too easy to critique this. Others may argue that there are plenty of translation tools but it's much easier to be a critic than to offer assistance. Personally I think the misspellings don't leave the intended message 'lost in translation'.\n\nI did wonder if it were worth adding music to the sound effects but I can see why music wasn't used as this Project's approach relies on evoking a reaction and music is one of the top ways of getting this. Why else is music loved by everyone? So in using music excessively it can detract from evoking the intended messages.\n\nThis famous quote should be considered because I do admire the effort in this art project & I hope it does get updated especially in its price.\n\n[b]''What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?'' - Vincent van Gogh[/b]\n\n~~~Liked what you see?
