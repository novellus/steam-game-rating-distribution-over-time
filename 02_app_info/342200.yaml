      \ 7</h2></strong><br><br>MechWarrior Online\u2122 Solaris 7 is a tactical, 'Mech-based\
      \ online shooter set in the vast BattleTech Universe. In the 31st century the\
      \ battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called\
      \ BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these\
      \ war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in\
      \ the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players.<br><br>Enter\
      \ the Solaris Arena.<br><br>The newest addition to MechWarrior online\u2122\
      , Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose\
      \ your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs\
      \ available based on the Mech\u2019s performance capabilities on the battlefield.\
      \ Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb\
      \ to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored\
      \ for intense Mech Combat.<br><br>Quick Play is where you'll find fast action,\
      \ fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction\
      \ Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories;\
      \ these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.<br><br>In Faction Play\
      \ you will field 4 \u2018Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance\
      \ to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering\
      \ and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's\
      \ territory across the Inner Sphere.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay\
      \ </h2></strong><br>Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical\
      \ positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or\
      \ seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners\
      \ of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the\
      \ sheer thrill of battle. <br><br><strong>Next Gen Mobility </strong> - By the\
      \ 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced\
      \ with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons\
      \ independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging\
      \ fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds\
      \ and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.<br><br><strong>Make\
      \ Every Shot Count </strong> - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output\
      \ against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation,\
      \ lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats.\
      \ Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest\
      \ way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies\
      \ if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.<br><br><strong>Fight Smart </strong>\
      \ - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements\
      \ to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat\
      \ each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker\
      \ or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication\
      \ among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify\
      \ vulnerable 'Mechs and components.<br><br><strong>Teamwork is the Difference\
      \ </strong> - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve\
      \ their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status,\
      \ and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital\
      \ component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary\
      \ information to tear their opponents to pieces.<br><br><strong>Information\
      \ Warfare</strong> - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information\
      \ back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and\
      \ heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault \u2018Mechs will use this information to\
      \ position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves\
      \ and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures.\
      \ It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their\
      \ desired role. <br><br><strong>Find the perfect 'Mech </strong>- Hundreds of\
      \ unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses.\
      \ Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed\
      \ to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but\
      \ can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different\
      \ 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.<br><br><strong>Choose\
      \ Your Allegiance </strong> - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to\
      \ earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together\
      \ with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction\
      \ Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or\
      \ defend worlds and shift the balance of power.<br><br><strong>Get Rewarded\
      \ </strong> - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing\
      \ faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.<br><br>Certain\
      \ items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either\
      \ be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments\
      \ in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards\
      \ from participating in special Events.<br><br>'Mech Experience (XP) gained\

    review: "I cannot remember when this game came out, it is that long.\n\nAll I\
      \ can remember is the constant hype and crushing disappointment that seems to\
      \ plague this game from the beta till the current day. And oh yea the multi\
      \ month crazy balancing cycle that they take extreme changes to the gameplay\
      \ changing stuff for God only knows what cow sense they use.\n\nTaking weeks\
      \ to months more to fix balances the broke in the new patch, which they then\
      \ freak up again in a new extreme balancing pass that break old stuff or introduce\
      \ new crap which they then take forever again to fix ...\n\nOh, not to mention\
      \ that they NEVER have been able to deliver what they promise on time or meet\
      \ expectations that they hype people up to have. Years of delays and delays\
      \ and broken promises and more broken promises and more hype, etc.\n\nThis game\
      \ have taken forever to get where it is. And it is true that it is better then\
      \ at the start. But the road is filled with too many side steps, too many broken\
      \ promises, too many bad balance cycles. And they took so so so so long, to\
      \ get where they are which is not even close to what they promise across the\
      \ years. \n\nAnd after so many years, it is bascially the same game with a bit\
      \ more variety. Look at PoE, look at Elder Scrolls, Dreadnought, World of Tanks,\
      \ etc. Across the years they become way more then their start. But MWO is still\
      \ just an improved deathmatch game in which all the different mods are just\
      \ thinny coatings to the deathmatch. After so many years you would expect way\
      \ way more.\n\nTo conclude, it is just now worth it to play the game. Because\
      \ sooner or later, they will freak with you and you will slowly and slowly die\
      \ inside by death of a thousand cuts.\n\nI have play 600+ hours across the many\
      \ years and have spend hundreds of dollars and I can no longer take the spiral\
      \ that is MWO."
