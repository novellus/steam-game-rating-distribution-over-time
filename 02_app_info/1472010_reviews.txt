I was interested in it because it takes place more than a decade after the loops began, which is different from a lot of time loop stories.\n\nBecause the game was made almost entirely by one person, the presentation is pretty basic - each character sprite has a few poses but only one outfit, and there are very few CGs. The music is fine but nothing special. I did like the map where you could choose what you did each day, but I'm pretty sure that until the third section you actually have to do all of the things anyway so it creates a sort of illusion of choice. I noticed quite a few typos in the text, but no real bugs or glitches.\n\nThe story was fine - I actually really liked the second chapter - but it drags on way too long with the main character doing variations on the same thing over and over. I liked the main character Alice a lot. That sort of brave, determined heroine is one of my favourite types of main character in a VN. That being said, most of the other characters are extremely tropey and change personalities quickly for the sake of the plot. All of the romances felt tacked-on and weird, especially after the way the characters had acted in the first chapter. (For example there is one character who grew extremely abusive during the loops and once she's changed her mind it's all kind of swept under the rug, and the 'villain' character does a complete 180 near the end).\n\nThis game does have some cool original ideas and a great main character, but it definitely needed some paring down and it can be annoying how much it gets so caught up in boring anime tropes. I could only recommend it if you really really like time loop stories.","timestamp_created":1609048192,"timestamp_updated":1609048559,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491480618715286255","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ZGx0fYCfsHSvQI="}
