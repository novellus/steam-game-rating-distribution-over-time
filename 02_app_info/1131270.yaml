    review: "Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this dog turd of a game.  I\u2019\
      m reviewing this because I was forced at gunpoint to play this for 60 minutes\
      \ and I don\u2019t want anyone getting the wrong idea and picking this up based\
      \ on my playtime.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n[list]+  that feeling of relief when\
      \ you exit out of the game.  Playing Zombie Golf is nothing short of torture.\
      \  That exit game option made me feel all warm and tingly.[/list]\n\n[list]+\
      \  this is someone\u2019s work.  Look.  I couldn\u2019t even make this and someone\
      \ did.  So they are already a more qualified programmer than me and I applaud\
      \ the effort it must take to learn a skill like coding.  Also it\u2019s a free\
      \ market and you can decide to put something out for nothing or to charge for\
      \ it.  If this game was free and it was someone\u2019s first attempt and making\
      \ a game and they wanted to test it out on Steam then I wouldn\u2019t be here.\
      \  But it costs money and it says it\u2019s in EA and it hasn\u2019t been updated\
      \ in a year.  This game is going nowhere.[/list]\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n[list]-\
      \  golfing surgeon simulator.  The controls are so bad for this game its laughable.\
      \  But its not funny in a Surgeon Sim or Ampu-tea way.  The angle on the ball\
      \ makes no sense, you can hit it at the same angle and same power 3 times in\
      \ a row and it will go in 3 different directions.  The cursor will go off the\
      \ screen making it impossible to aim and generally you are just in for a bad\
      \ time all round trying to take these balls.[/list]\n\n[list]-  sound.  There\
      \ is virtually no noise in this game.  A zombie will groan if you hit it.  A\
      \ red barrel will go boom if you hit it.  The ball bounces and makes a tapping\
      \ sound.  But other than the terrible title screen music, the game has pretty\
      \ much been audibly sterilized.[/list]\n\n[list]-  lack of levels.  It might\
      \ be a little bit more worth it if there were more levels and perhaps a level\
      \ selector if by some miracle you found a level you enjoyed playing but as it\
      \ stands there are only 4 levels and they all suck. [/list]\n\n[list]-  general\
      \ boredom and frustration.  There is not a single thing redeeming about this\
      \ game.  At least if there were some cards or some cheevos for say, landing\
      \ a ball in the back of a pickup truck.  Or hitting the ball into 2 zombies,\
      \ you know\u2026.like some sort of challenge?  The only challenge is to not\
      \ gnaw your own fingers off in despair while playing this.[/list]\n\n[h1] THE\
      \ CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nTake a mulligan on this game back to before you even hit\
      \ the play button.  There is nothing to see here.  I can\u2019t even say this\
      \ game is rough round the edges and could be saved with some work.  It would\
      \ require a full overhaul and I just don\u2019t see that happening."
