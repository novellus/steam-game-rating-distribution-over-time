Use your investigative skills to unlock the mystery of the murder of Harris Bullard and uncover the enigma of his mysterious invention.  Who murdered the strange professor?  Was it the estranged ex-wife, the new assistant, the former research partner, the errand boy, or something else entirely?\n\nDead Secret is a first-person horror mystery set in rural Kansas in the 1960s.  Playing as a reporter you investigate a death of the prominent professor; searching his home for clues by clicking items, sometimes combining them, and progressing from there.  For the most part you will be moving from room to room solving puzzles and finding items that will unlock further mysteries within the house.  The puzzles are relatively straightforward and require some thinking and deductive reasoning along with a good eye for clues.\n\nWhile the world is three dimensional, the game sometimes feels like a point-and-click game; for example, moving from one spot to another requires clicking in that direction after which the game will walk you over there.  The traveling method feels a bit cumbersome and not very intuitive as I found myself trying to walk around on my own quite often.  It is important to note that the game was originally designed for VR, and as such, some of the features seem a bit off.  With that aspect of the game known, Dead Secret can be played without VR—which was my experience with the game.\n\nThe story of Dead Secret is very well done.  Monologues and found papers all tell the story and deepen the mystery—for those who like to blast past the reading part of games you probably will not get what is going on but for those who take the time to read the notes you are in for a real treat.  I enjoyed learning more about the different off-screen characters and was thoroughly engrossed with the mystery.\n\nAchievements are easy to get—with Dead Secret being the first game where I didn’t have to replay the entire story to get the alternate endings; you just need to start from the last game save.  Sadly, there are only five achievements for Dead Secret and I would have liked to have seen more achievements but was grateful for what was given.\n\nThe controls were okay but understanding that the game was originally designed for VR—they are not bad.  I found myself going back and forth between the keyboard and the controller with little change in efficiency or ease.\n\nDead Secret is not a bad game…I found it quite enjoyable.  And while short; the game does lend itself to the horror mystery genre and I found myself invested in the enigma and was delightfully terrified with several sequences.  I recommend this game for those who like either genres or for those looking for a quick game to play.","timestamp_created":1607650487,"timestamp_updated":1607650487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rfXbp/YCcp33uAI="}
