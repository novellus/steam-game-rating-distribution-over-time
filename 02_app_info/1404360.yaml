    about_the_game: Explore the cliff town of <strong>Eklan Tor</strong>, located
      in the Hidden Lands. <strong>Eklan Tor</strong> is one of the few places in
      the world of monsters where humans can be found. The task you've been given
      is to find various things that have been hidden inside buildings, behind trees,
      and inside containers. See if you can find em all!<br><br>This virtual reality
      game is actually a prototype I made for a larger game I've started working on.
      I wanted to see how complex a world I could make in VR without the framerate
      dying. Turns out, pretty darn complex! Not only that, I wanted to create something
      that allowed someone to really explore an interactive miniature world. I spent
      so much time on it that I wanted to give people a chance to try it out themselves.
      It's a fairly short game, maybe a half hour long, so I decided to offer it for
      just a small amount.<br><br>If you had a good time visiting this world and know
      someone with VR who might also enjoy going exploring, please let them know about
      this! I really want as many people to enjoy it as possible.

    review: 'I played this on Oculus, and I instantly fell in love with it. Discovering
      the responses of the world, like the bugs or the regrowing trees is very fun
      in an adventurous way. A little story guides you well through the game.

      The game controls are smooth and not annoying, like seen in a lot of VR experiences
      and games. For example, the pointer for selecting menu points and stuff becomes
      visible only if youre pressing a button (A / X on Oculus). How many youtube
      videos did I accidentally klick just because the controls of the video player
      were crappy! But this way, youre more in control what you select.


      This was a nice, calm and fun experience, and Im really curious about Juniper
      Sky!'
