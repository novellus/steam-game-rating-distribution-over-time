    reviews: "\u201CWell, this game was weird. And possibly quite brilliant, too.\
      \ I\u2019ve never played anything like it, to be honest. It\u2019s at once an\
      \ obsessively complex deep dive into maritime history, but set in a strange\
      \ fantasy world, and a weirdo RPG about being a pirate. There\u2019s worker\
      \ placement activities. There\u2019s dialogue segments. There are resource management\
      \ elements. Ship-to-ship combat involves a (fucking astonishing) typing game,\
      \ and then a sort of side scrolling beat \u2019em up bit? A huge element of\
      \ the game revolves around managing your relationship with the ship\u2019s captain,\
      \ and choosing how often to contradict their orders. There\u2019s eerie, awful,\
      \ brilliant music. It occasionally reminded me of Dwarf Fortress. What I\u2019\
      m saying is, there\u2019s no way of summarising A Pirate Quartermaster in a\
      \ couple of paragraphs. It was like a game made in a parallel universe with\
      \ entirely different ideas about what a game should be like, and I\u2019ve rarely\
      \ encountered something with such a hit rate of entirely original mechanics.\
      \ The demo only let me dip a toe into this odd and salt-stained world, so it\u2019\
      s hard to say whether the full game is likely to be entirely engrossing, or\
      \ a barely-playable mess. Either way though, and I don\u2019t say this lightly,\
      \ it\u2019s some kind of masterpiece. Don\u2019t let this ship pass you in the\
      \ night.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/06/19/the-best-steam-festival-demos-management-games/\"\
