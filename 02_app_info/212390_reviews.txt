The Class System seemed nice, the Character Creation was ok, but f.e the Tutorial started already... Lame. It could've been ''something'', but it's just not. \n\nI played a total of 2,5 Hours. That was enough for me, to make a myself a Picture about the Game. \n\n*Steam did not reckognize the Game anymore after the first Start. Whatever was the Reason, I don't know.","timestamp_created":1488319565,"timestamp_updated":1488976879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501391589641571045","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42YP81toCe5Gycw=="}
