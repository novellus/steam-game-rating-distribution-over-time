    review: "    I've not put a terribly long amount of time into this game, but I\
      \ have played enough to decide if I enjoy it or not and then figure out why\
      \ that is. Worth noting here, I haven't played any co-op yet so I cannot judge\
      \ that.\n    First and foremost: I have enjoyed this game and eagerly await\
      \ what more content will be added before it is in its final form. I am going\
      \ to list the things in this game I feel were done well and the elements I felt\
      \ were weakest, as well as a small explanation for each.\n\n    Strong elements:\n\
      \            Movement: Gliding, grappling, or teleporting around all feel good.\n\
      \             Variety: The selection of weapons and abilities is great, allowing\
      \ for many play-styles and encouraging replayability. There is also a selection\
      \ of unique items that can feel very exciting to find and use.\n        Presentation:\
      \ This game feels satisfying. Whether it\u2019s being launched in the air, setting\
      \ off explosions, or mowing down enemies with a machine gun it is done well.\n\
      \        \u201CLevel\u201D design: Initially I felt much of the game was simple\
      \ and open, but as I followed the story things quickly spiraled into complex\
      \ and fun design\n        Basic gameplay loop: There is almost always a reward\
      \ befitting the challenge so it feels good to progress and work your way to\
      \ some of the more powerful areas.\n        Story: Surprisingly good. There\
      \ is still much of it yet to be put in the game, but I found myself happy to\
      \ uncover more of the main story as I went. Also, very few but entertaining\
      \ side quests. \n\n    Now onto some of the weaker elements:\n        UI: It\
      \ was mostly good, but for some reason I expect all UI\u2019s to be perfect.\
      \ The way it tracked important enemy\u2019s was confusing, and sometimes the\
      \ fire particle effect covered important info. Also I couldn\u2019t find the\
      \ option to completely unbind actions from any key, which was odd.\n       \
      \ Bugs: I only had some minor issues, but It came up often enough I want to\
      \ mention it. Sometimes Items or enemies would be inside of walls and the like,\
      \ and at one point an object I was meant to defend kept spawning in lava, killing\
      \ it. These never halted progression, but they kept me from completing or getting\
      \ my rewards for hacking terminals.\n        Balance: This is the thing I am\
      \ least sure about, but it seems like some weapon types are much stronger than\
      \ others. Most enemies are in your face, and there are few bosses to speak of,\
      \ which means it makes the most sense to have close-range/aoe weapons above\
      \ much else. \n\n    There is one last thing I want to mention about this game.\
      \ It is early access, and it feels like it. You can walk into unfinished areas\
      \ of the map and the most structured parts of the story end far too soon. If\
      \ you want a completely finished and polished game, then this isn\u2019t it\
      \ quite yet (This was written in January 2021). Regardless, I enjoyed this game\
      \ and recommend it to anyone who\u2019s eye it has caught.\n"
