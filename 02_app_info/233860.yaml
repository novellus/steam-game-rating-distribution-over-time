      \ in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870\

    short_description: A free-roaming squad based RPG. Focusing on open-ended sandbox
      gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel,
      a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals.
      Research new equipment and craft new gear.
