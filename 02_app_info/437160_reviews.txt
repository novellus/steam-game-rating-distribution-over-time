The story is beautifully written, the music is thoroughly engaging and the best thing in my opinion is the art style. The art feels nostalgic and very effective in portraying exactly the situation of the characters.\nI was absolutely mesmerized by how great the first episode was, so I had to buy the season pass directly.","timestamp_created":1609770064,"timestamp_updated":1609770064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiLvx5vYCd7azwAI="}
