    short_description: The girls hear from school principal Ryuko that the school
      is considering Taiwan as the destination for the school trip. Since Taiwan is
      one of only a few advance cycling nations, she instructs the cycling club to
      go to Taiwan as part of a preliminary inspection for the school trip.
