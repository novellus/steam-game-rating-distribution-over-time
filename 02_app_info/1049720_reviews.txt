You need to push the coloured tanks into their coloured square. You can't let them go of the edge or they will de-spawn and if you stand under the cubes when they are moving you will die. It is adorable i love it when you/the cat goes of the edge there is like a rainbow effect. The game is simple yet fun i will play more. The only downside is the title screen may make you dizzy. but all and all it if fun.\n7.6/10","timestamp_created":1559126510,"timestamp_updated":1559126510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524253726005554199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm9HLgesCc7GiwgE="}
