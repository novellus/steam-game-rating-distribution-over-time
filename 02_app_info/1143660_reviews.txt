However, the text which describes the design of the characters is written in a language I cannot read (Japanese, I assume). So, I can only enjoy a part of this DLC, therefore, I think it is a little bit expensive. But I recommend this DLC if you enjoyed the wallpapers.\n","timestamp_created":1608568587,"timestamp_updated":1608568587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5iKw/YCdPf8uwI="}
