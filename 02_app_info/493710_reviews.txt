Oddly beautiful.\n\nHowever I cannot recommend this game at all due to it's terrible controls, movement and unpolished feel, for example your cursor going off-screen.\n\nThe world is badly designed in my opinion, the developer didn't properly explain things through the game play/world, making you go places you weren't supposed to go or come to a road-block where you don't understand what you're supposed to do.\nNo real story to speak off and the game feels extremely unpolished. It feels like the developer didn't put that much work into.\nI'm not saying they didn't put work into it, but when you leave it a mess it certainly feels like it.\nThey built it and decided to leave the rough edges.\nThey put the food on the plate but decided it wasn't necessary to clean up the plate after the fact.\n\nI really do enjoy these walking simulator games. I love weird and abstract games but do not expect me to give your game any love when you leave it unfinished with terrible controls and bugs that are simple to fix, like the cursor going off-screen.\n\nI wish the developer had just taken the time to polish the game up after it was made...\n\n\n[h1]Curator page[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29162366/]my Curator page[/url].[/i]","timestamp_created":1492165260,"timestamp_updated":1573387998,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582321822643280029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws/LOqu4Cfb7hdg=="}
