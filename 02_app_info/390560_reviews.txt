The game is poorly monetized and not perfectly balanced but the core gameplay is free and fun. To not try it would be stupid.\n\nFantasy Strike is more than just \"another fighting game.\" It's a philosophy that fighting games should be for everyone.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]+Accessible.[/b] Most fighters require hours of practice to achieve [i]basic competency[/i] with a character. Strange inputs and ridiculous combos are either hard on the fingers or require a lot of practice for no reason. Fantasy Strike is different. The controls are purposefully designed to be as simple as possible without losing any of the depth that fighting games are known for. There are also spotlight videos to get you up to speed on any character in under 10 minutes. You can also disable macros to ensure that every input is exactly what you want (unlike grabs in Smash Bros.).\n[*][b]+Great feedback.[/b] From the \"JUMPABLE!\" and \"COUNTERHIT!\" messages to the frame advantage sparks and flashing hit points (in danger of guard damage), this game's feedback is immaculate. You'll usually know what's going on and what you did wrong.\n[*][b]+Competitive.[/b] You can't grind or pay for characters or power.\n[*][b]+Elegant.[/b] The yomi counter is especially innovative and fun. It's beautiful!\n[*][b]+Challenging.[/b] While FS is easy to pick up it's [i]very hard[/i] to master. The mind games are intense, the roster is diverse, and you can train and learn nuances and techniques like in any other fighter. There are 144 matchups. There's serious replay value here.\n[*][b]+Plays great.[/b] Rollback networking and cross platform support make this game a joy to play.\n[*][b]+Sounds great.[/b] This is some of my favorite fighting game music.\n[*][b]+Looks great.[/b] There are occasionally low res textures, bad animation frames, and flat shading, but it's the best that you could ask for from an indie company. The Fantasy Strike world looks pretty good in 3D.\n[*][b]+Very unique ranked mode.[/b] Ranked mode uniquely builds 8 player tournament brackets on the fly to make things more interesting. You can rank up quickly if you win consistently. In a ranked match you pick a team of 3 characters who are randomly pit against the opponent's 3 characters. You have to win with all 3 to win the set. This means you can't counterpick, you get more matchup variety, and if you lose hard to a character you won't have to deal with them for the rest of the set!\n[*][b]+Good updates.[/b] These include bug fixes, balance changes, and community requested features like practice dummy recording.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]-Far less freedom[/b], especially compared to Smash Ultimate. A lot of times you'll have 1 correct move and 10 wrong moves, with no choices. And if you time it wrong, even that might not work.\n[*][b]-Oppressive spam.[/b] I find zoning boring.\n[*][b]-Some feedback is poor.[/b] From Jaina's offscreen arrows to the ambiguous fuzzy guard, sometimes you actually can't see what's happening.\n[*][b]-No hitboxes in training mode.[/b] This feature is really important but missing!?\n[*][b]-Frame advantage for throws isn't shown in training mode.[/b]\n[*][b]-Jaina's RED DRAGON is way too slow.[/b] It's obviously meant to drain Midori's dragon meter but Sirlin Games should consider speeding up the whole process. This could go for all supers.\n[*][b]-The controls are accessible but the mechanics are not.[/b] Many things aren't explained. What moves can be canceled into others on hit/block? What moves are immune to grabs? What moves break armor? What's a tick throw? What's oki? Meaty attacks? Safe jumps? Backwards throw? Armor moves stop working during hitstun (which makes the armor ironically useless)? etc.\n[*][b]-Overpriced cosmetics.[/b]\n[*][b]-Random daily shop.[/b] Even if you buy premium currency to support development, it's really hard to buy what you want.\n[*][b]-The premium DLC is half-assed.[/b] The Collector's Pack doesn't include the Original Soundtrack, and the Original Soundtrack doesn't have the character select music. I already asked, and Sirlin Games has no plans to change anything.\n[*][b]-No handicaps[/b] (custom health).\n[*][b]Fuzzy techniques and more.[/b] Because block and yomi counter are instant actions that recover instantly, you can perform them before other actions as option selects. This greatly increases the skill ceiling while requiring more precise inputs. The counter is to delay your grab by about 5 frames. Not so accessible, eh?\n[*][b]-Music and costume priority seems to be determined at random?[/b]\n[*][b]-Limited audio options.[/b] You can't turn off voices without SFX, you can't choose the exact music to play in matches, and you can't disable ambient noises from the menu without also disabling it from matches.\n[*][b]-Replay's can't be saved[/b] without \"Fantasy+\", a subscription costing up to $5/month. I don't need to tell you how stupid this is. Pro tip: You can always watch your last replay and record it on Windows 10 with WIN + Alt + R.\n[*][b]-Balance could be better.[/b] The characters are [i]not[/i] balanced equally. Rook and Onimaru are particularly bad. They're slow, have missing/weaker fundamental utility options, and their gameplans simply don't work in a meta infested with strong zoners that easily escape their pressure and return the fire. Their armored moves are blatantly worse than the invincible moves all the zoners have. Rook has BOTH of the worst supers in the game, several of his key moves whiff if the opponent jumps or performs \"aerial\" ground attacks, his Vines attack is so sluggish that it's hard to land even in ideal scenarios, and his lack of a real anti-air essentially makes his last hitpoint useless (you can spam jump attacks to beat anything Rook does or stall the match for free). Onimaru doesn't have a real jump-in attack (it's unsafe on HIT!). Rook and Oni's other moves tend to be slow or unsafe and can fail even when they feel like they honestly shouldn't. Meanwhile you have characters like Quince whose anti-air hits up to the ceiling and combos for half your life bar AND puts you into a mixup blender. The community agrees that some characters are clearly stronger, and you'll usually see the pros playing the same characters. But don't let my balance complaints hold you back from trying the game! It's not THAT bad; just know that Rook and Oni (usually) have uphill battles.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game's monetization scheme is dubious, but the actual gameplay is fun. While I don't enjoy the game flow or mechanics as much as Smash Ultimate, Fantasy Strike is easier to play and does everything right. It's the kind of fighting game that we've been sorely lacking. Games like this are a rare treat and I'm happy to see Sirlin's design work finally put into action. Now I have much clearer idea of how traditional fighting games play and precisely why they're inferior to Smash. [b]Try it then buy it[/b] to support Sirlin's team so they can improve the game. We now have 12/20 of the Yomi characters at the time of writing. I'm excited to see who's added next!\n\n[h1]Actual (best) prices[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Product[/th]\n        [th]Cost[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Base game[/td]\n        [td]FREE[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Core pack (single player modes and friend match)[/td]\n        [td]$20[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Your favorite cosmetics (for 3 ranked characters)[/td]\n        [td][b]Up to[/b] $50[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]ALL your favorite cosmetics[/td]\n        [td][b]Up to[/b] $160[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]ALL cosmetics[/td]\n        [td]$720[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nDisclaimer: This does NOT include sales.
