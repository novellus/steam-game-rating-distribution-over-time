    review: "How to Survive Barricade! DLC Review\n\nExplore all day and defend all\
      \ night, how long will you last?\n\nPlease note that this Review may contain\
      \ spoilers from the Base game \n\nSome key points that this game add on has\
      \ to offer:\n\n1.\tNew game mode: Barricade!\n2.\tUnique crafting recipes.\n\
      \nReplayability:\n\nHow to Survive Barricade! DLC is fun when played co-op with\
      \ a buddy; chances are if you have one that enjoys this game as much as you\
      \ do, the two of you will be taking this mode out to test your skills in the\
      \ all new defensive game mode. \n\nIt has access to all the DLC content that\
      \ the game has to offer, so you can truly put your skills to the test to see\
      \ how long you can hold out against the undead.\n\nMGR Gaming\u2019s Conclusions:\n\
      \nHow to Survive Barricade! DLC is fun with a buddy, alone it kind of feels\
      \ like a drag, it is boring and not very inspiring to play, but then again,\
      \ this game mode isn\u2019t really meant to be played alone.\n\nKeeping an already\
      \ injured survivor from being attacked by hordes of Zombies while keeping yourself\
      \ alive is a two Zombie slayer job. The game mode can be played at every difficulty\
      \ level the game has, yeah even on Kovac\u2019s Way. Once the game has started\
      \ you will start in a small camp on Santa Barbara Island with Henry being on\
      \ a stretcher; Your goal is to prevent him from being attacked and killed, if\
      \ Henry dies it is game over.\n\nLooking at your screen; on the top you will\
      \ see the timer running, counting the seconds of how long you\u2019ve been holding\
      \ out and at the bottom you can see Henry\u2019s health bar.\n\nDuring the day\
      \ you scavenge for food and materials; small sectors at a time grabbing everything\
      \ you can carry back to home base; it is here that you will notice that certain\
      \ new items can be found such as planks and steel plates. These items are used\
      \ to construct barricades which can be built to funnel and redirect zombies\
      \ to your play style or strategy, along with these barricades you can also build\
      \ turrets that can help you keep the zombies off of Henry, provided you have\
      \ ammunition for them to fire.\n\nMuch of the Island is closed down either by\
      \ foliage that you have to chop down or burn. Other areas are blocked off by\
      \ barricades that require explosives to destroy, as you scavenge by day picking\
      \ up materials you craft and improve your arsenal to better protect your little\
      \ camp. As you manage to open up more of the island, so the amount of materials\
      \ you can scavenge increases.\n\nScavenge and explore by day, defend by night!\
      \ That is when the horde attacks\u2026 As the days go by the Zombies start getting\
      \ stronger and stronger, the number of Zombies that attack you also increases,\
      \ and at the end of every fifth wave a boss attack as well.\n\nAs I mentioned,\
      \ this game mode can be fun with a buddy, but solo I do not recommend it, it\
      \ is a bore to go at it alone, a few things that could of made this a more fun\
      \ and unique experience; instead of a static location we should of had a few\
      \ randomized locations that are available to defend from, Henry cannot be healed,\
      \ so every life point he has is precious. There is no completing this mode,\
      \ there is only you holding out until you eventually die or until Henry dies.\n\
