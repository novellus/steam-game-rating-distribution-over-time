Looks and feels quite different, but it's still Supaplex, with its 111 levels.\nThere are quite a lot of remakes of this classic arcade/logic game, but adding an additional dimension to the graphics after so many years make it totally worth to replay at least some of the levels.","timestamp_created":1579516630,"timestamp_updated":1579516630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551569521427154541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv+Kh4e8Cc/mA7QE="}
