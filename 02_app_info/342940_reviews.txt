Starting area was misleading in regards to system specs I would need, as soon as I left it basically became unplayable. I would suggest 8-16 gb Ram minimum until it becomes more optimized. I enjoy the systems, and love that their is all types of different skills, but for me currently it's basically unplayable. I recommend it for people who's computer can handle more demanding games than how this appears. Personally I'll wait until it's more out of Early Access. I passed the 2 hour mark trying to optimize settings so likely won't be able to get a refund either.","timestamp_created":1609799139,"timestamp_updated":1609799235,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4297g5/YCcdTDwAI="}
