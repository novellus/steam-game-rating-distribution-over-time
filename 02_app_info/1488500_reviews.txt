No objectives or timer of any kind make for a genuinely relaxing experience, allowing you to get absorbed into the vibrantly-colored world of this game. The tower interiors are especially mesmerizing, and the town square is thoughtfully laid out and peaceful. A wonderful and promising first foray into game design and programming - well done to John and Alex!","timestamp_created":1608687473,"timestamp_updated":1608687473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltrPxvYCdKKpvAI="}
