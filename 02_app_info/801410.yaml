      who suffer from depression often find it hard to put into words what they deal
      with, those who have never had true depression don't understand it. Harder still
      is to notice someone suffering without them telling you, many find out only
      when it's too late. We all look back and think, &quot;Is there something I could
      have done?&quot; If you look hard enough, you can find different choices, but

      sometimes see a light to help escape the darkness, or be forever wrapped in
      it.

    review: 'Hidden life is a game that reminds you that every single choice you make
      can and will effect your or other peoples life.

      For the game itself: There are some minor bugs, but nothing to worry about.


      You can finish one ending with exploring everything in about 40 minutes, I would
      guess that you need about 2h to complete everything.


      Defenetly worth trying.'
