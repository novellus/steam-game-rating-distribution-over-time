Indeed, Deadfall Tropics is difficult and it's whole offering is based on difficulty.\nThe gameplay seems to be an hommage to the old Rick Dangerous game of Atari ST/Amiga fame.\nYou will have to restart the same jump a dozen times until you perfect it and learn the good combination. Only then, can you proceed through the dozen other chokepoints of each level.\nThat said it's the good kind of difficulty, the one that you can overcome with strategy. The last level will require a bit of perseverance because it becomes a tad hectic and the game doesn't save enough progression at this point. But even an average, non-hardcore player like myself I managed to complete the game, and if you stick to it, you'll constantly amaze yourself by how you can exploit the floaty platforming to beat the odds in the most unclean ways.\nThe dev managed to reach the sweet spot where you feel rewarded by yourself for having overcome the obstacles and at the same time get the narrative reward.\n\nThe old movie theme and the narrative aspect are rewarding enough to make you want to always reach the next level and see the story. It's not a literary masterpiece, far from it, but it's very pleasant and feel like a little bone thrown your way.\nAll the character portraits are ripped of old actors photos and the music too evoques some dramatic tension felt in classic movies. The whole thing is aesthetically very pleasant.\nThe pixel graphics are very well used and perfectly set the mood of the sun setting over a dark jungle. Only the text could have used a less pixelled font because it's hard to read sometimes.\n\nI think this game could set a new standard for competitive difficult platformer, maybe the dev should think about implementing some sort of global scoreboard with a way to know every player's progression.\n\nI can only recomend it, but whatever you do, don't press the letter Q !  \n\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1555713460,"timestamp_updated":1555978022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx43ho+oCffTKvwE="}
