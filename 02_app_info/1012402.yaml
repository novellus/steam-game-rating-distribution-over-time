    review: 'i feel compelled to make this review after seeing some misinformation
      from a negative by @ShelLuser bellow.


      Use my review as a reference when reading other reviews as this won''t be the
      most in-depth review into all of the mechanics as I''m not aware of every mechanic
      in this game, tho I feel I can give decent input about this specific, which
      is the only one I bought out of all of them with what few extra I had to spend.




      -----------Only One DLC Review-----------


      This is the first JRPG I''ve played while I don''t have everything down I can
      tell you that in 32hrs, I have learned alot, there will be a better reviewer
      which will go in-depth into certain aspects of JRPG mechanics in this game as
      someone already has, but like I said I don''t regret my purchase.. I actually
      think this is one of the best purchases you can make seeing how I only bought
      one DLC.


      1. AGI = Agility is the biggest part of this DLC


      I played this on hard despite this being my first JRPG bc I don''t want to breeze
      through the game for the story(which is also pretty good) & I also want some
      struggle/challenge to my fights which I know will personally encourage me to
      want to learn how to best/effectively use my characters.


      In the beginning you''re basically untouchable, you react & move faster, which
      means your character will for the most part dodge virtually everything. I came
      to realize just how important my AGI was when I realized hit my 30th hour and
      started fighting more & higher level enemies.


      I forgot to equip Warrior Set to Clea & Lucil and when they had their first
      battles that got deSTRoYED!!


      Clea got Gangr*ped on sight & once she got revived, they went for a part two
      & I was powerless to stop them.


      Lucil did not get the same treatment as Clea, but she would also die in a hit
      or two which left me with Shina, who eventually got met the same fate as Clea
      due to her low health. Even with her high Agility(AGI) she dodged all attacks
      from like what felt like 5-9 Martyrs.. But just when I thought she might go
      next they went another round on her and she dropped like a rock and I lost everything
      except my money.


      (keep in mind Clea/Lucil where my highest ranked members, and Shina was my lowest
      yet survived the longest)


      I have been smooth sailing through this game, not absolutely no difficulty/pay-to-win
      style, but it''s def helping & now i''m fighting Martyrs that are actually making
      me strategize more than prior & the stupid high Agility helps so much from having
      to waste SP on reviving characters who die only to watch them die again.


      So the weapons may be "Weaker" than those in the Travelers Set, it''s good to
      note that they''re not the weakest weapons in the game far from it & the AGI
      boost alone is worth it & is really, really helping me in higher level dungeons
      where the difference in not losing everyone in party is making it to the next
      turn, not necessarily dishing damage.

      (everyone has like 699+ Agility)


      2. Rings


      2.1: Toxic Ring - Resists Poison / / boosts HP by 1400+ at the cost of physical
      attack


      2.2: Anti-seal Ring - A ring that ensures the wearer cannot have their skills
      sealed / / boosts Magic Defense by 140+


      2.3: Nimble Ring - Resistance to "Slow" effect given by enemy Martyrs / / More
      Agility boost 140+


      2.4: Zen Ring - Resistance to "Stop" effect given by Martyrs / / Boosts everything
      by 47(+/-)


      2.5: Mind of Steel - Decreases EX Gain after Battle


      Not exactly sure what Anit-Stun does but the name are very literal & unsure
      of the benefit to Mind of Steel but the more I play the more I learn.


      3. Weapons look pretty cool & matches their whole Bagu/Glitch color scheme,
      both sets have weapons that match the characters better & still haven''t found
      a weapon stronger than what I have from Rook -in-game so I''ve been using these
      as my go-to weapons from the start.


      In my opinion the Travelers Set & the Warriors Set have their own objectives,
      and will appeal to different types of players. EXP boosts and initially ATK
      in the start may be your thing, but I can say one thing I''m far from regretting
      my purchase especially now that i''m nearing the end, where dungeons are getting
      alot harder & I wonder how many people would swap Rook Sets if they knew exactly
      what they were really getting into with either sets.


      I would whole recommend thisto someone who has anyone regardless if you have
      money to waste on DLCs or not, just be sure to read more reviews into other
      DLCs if you''re strapped for cash, but I can''t see how you can go wrong here.'
