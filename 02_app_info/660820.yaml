    review: 'You thought it is Tetris, what could possibly go wrong?


      A lot! Unfortunately the controls are not direct enough and actually do not
      give you back the feeling of the original Gameboy Tetris. Controls are troublesome.
      This needs to be fixed.


      And then there is no options menu. Game is in the center of your playground
      and you can not manually recenter it yourself. This is a no go for a controller
      game, since I play controller games in front of my PC and not like a normal
      room-scale game in the center of my room.


      Overall and since those two issues are a game breaker for me, I can not recommend
      this Tetris emulation for VR.


      NO RECOMMENDED until problems are fixed.
