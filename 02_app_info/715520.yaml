    about_the_game: <i>It dazzles us all - the world of trading, the trick of being
      able to trade paper and promise for money, the art of creating something of
      value from virtually nothing.</i><br><br>Wall Street Junior is a simulation
      game based on an equilibrium-targeted, event-driven model of economy and financial
      markets. The simulation evaluates the performance of economy's components and
      predicts the state of markets accordingly. Players have the option of interacting
      with the markets and trying out different investment strategies, yet to be successful
      in such one has to be aware of the current situation on the exchange floors
      and constantly keep up with the news not to miss anything that might render
      his investment invaluable.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Freedom of Simulation</h2>Your
      behavior on the market, as of a player, is entirely up to you; one may choose
      to buy a bunch of stocks today and sell them tomorrow with a profit, go for
      bonds while speeding up the simulation a little to receive the coupon payments
      claiming profit on the long run, or don't bother with the instrument trading
      at all and place their bets in the form of options that will expire one day
      with a (hopefully significant) premium. Some investments may, however, bear
      some risk, and it is then reasonable to hedge against inconvenient market moves
      in order to lessen the possible negative outcomes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Extensions
      to the Original Model</h2>Apart from the vanilla trading of instruments, currencies
      and derivatives, your company is fully capable trading on margin, offering loans
      to ordinary customers and issuing fixed-income securities on its own. These
      ways of raising capital give you the ability to operate with creditors money,
      thus maximizing the profits, but everything comes at a price and the interest
      responsibilities might one day present a significant burden, if not issued with
      care.<br><br>The game features a set of tutorials, campaign scenarios and a
      sandbox mode. The tutorials are written in an easy-going fashion, not going
      into much detail but covering all necessary topics and providing references
      to external resources discussing those of lesser importance. Campaign scenarios
      are merely a guided set-up with limitations regarding the options you have.
      The sandbox mode is stripped of all limitations and allows you to experiment
      on the simulation, with no exception of bringing companies on the brink of bankruptcy.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Development Decisions</h2>Wall Street Junior was developed with
      the specific intentions of making a realistic simulation. These intentions had
      the positive effect of the game becoming (at times literally hand-) editable
      and easy to be modded, with the rather negative side effect of the user interface
      becoming complicated at the first sight. The game is in the Alpha stage and
      we actively encourage all player feedback to help us correct undesired behavior
      of the simulation and improve all the parts that might require further clarification.

    review: "This game is one of the most advanced and well made trading games. You\
      \ can invest in companies, currencies etc! If you like trading and economy you\
      \ have to try this game!! \nA bit complex and hard to understand at first but\
      \ after some time you will get the hang of it.\nI wish the main menu was a bit\
      \ more intiutive tho, you can get lost easely and i cant figuere out how to\
      \ load a save game. \n\n9/10 one of the best if not the best trading games i\
      \ have ever played"
