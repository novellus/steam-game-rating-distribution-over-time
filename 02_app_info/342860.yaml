    review: The UI is a disaster. If you select a hero, and that hero is on a pile
      of gold, he'll waste his action picking up the gold instead of doing what you
      were planning to do. That's just one example; about one quarter of the clicks
      do something that I do not want. I am fighting the game designers instead of
      the creatures in the dungeon, it's horrible. I thought Dark Quest 2 was bad
      on this front, but 1 is waaaaay worse.
