    review: "I love the CC games of old and the CC3 remake, Cross of Iron, is possibly\
      \ the best example of the game where you can play the Germans and Russians on\
      \ the Eastern Front. But this game is probably the next best. Lovely looking\
      \ maps and graphics for a CC game, nice sounds, and good UI make it the most\
      \ modern CC game to play if you want hand drawn maps as opposed to the most\
      \ recent 3d ones (which I personally dont like)\n\nWhen I first started the\
      \ game my mouse was scrolling the window far too fast. But someone recommended\
      \ I change the Windows 10 mouse precision in the mouse settings to 'on' and\
      \ that seems to have sorted the map scrolling to a reasonable speed. Still shoots\
      \ off occasionally but most of the time is fine now.\n\nYou get lovely French\
      \ maps in this game with lots of good US units and tanks against an outnumbered\
      \ German army so its similar to other CC games in that you either play defensively\
      \ or offensively depending on which side and game you like to play. \n\nNow\
      \ that I have my mouse issue sorted I would say this game and Cross of Iron\
      \ are the two best Close combats games you can get today. And they are both\
      \ superb, suspenseful, intensive, and immersive games to play."
