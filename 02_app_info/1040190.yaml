    about_the_game: Sleepwalker is an isometric puzzle where a sleepwalking man in
      his pajamas needs to be guided to safety. The character walks automatically
      and cannot be controlled directly. Instead the player needs to put up signs
      and objects in the environment to help him around and to avoid contact with
      monsters. Signs are collected in a vertical bar on the right side of the screen.
      Farther levels include new types of items. The game contains about 100 levels.

    review: "It's tough to review games from my childhood, but I'll try to be as objective\
      \ as I can.\n\nPros:\n+ Core mechanics are good. Basically the point of each\
      \ level is to guide MC to the end by placing obstacles on the level in real\
      \ time. When facing an obstacle MC always turns right. Some levels have interactable\
      \ elements. Pressing Q shows the grid, so you wouldn't be confused by isometric\
      \ perspective (the most important button in the game);\n+ Variety: There are\
      \ lots of tools like arrows, crates, fans, bombs, teleporters, holes, skulls,\
      \ magnets etc. Game often tries to throw something new;\n+ Final levels are\
      \ genuinely hard;\n+ On some levels you may get stuck for a long-long time.\
      \ You can skip levels however (up to 4)\n+ Some levels require a good mix of\
      \ precise planning and precise timing;\n+ Music is good;\n\nCons:\n- The biggest\
      \ flaw is this: out of 99 levels only a quarter or so are genuinely excellent,\
      \ the rest are either ok-ish or straight up bad (like levels 83 and 84 where\
      \ you're just pulling boxes with magnets for 4 minutes); \n- There are no saves,\
      \ only passwords, so don't forget to write it down BEFORE you quit; \n- Sometimes\
      \ the game crashes (it didn't back in the day). Played on win 7. So write passwords\
      \ each 5-10 levels as well;\n- Font for passwords is almost ok, it's easy to\
      \ mistake u and v however;\n- Presentation/graphics are hit or miss. Details\
      \ like screen transitions and art style in menus will take some time to get\
      \ used to;\n- On some levels you control the robot, his controls are very precise\
      \ so it may be hard for some to get used to;\n- The function to speedup the\
      \ levels would benefit the pace: once you know where and when to place obstacles\
      \ you're just waiting for the MC to walk where he needs to be;\n- Although the\
      \ music is good, I think there is not enough of it, a couple more tracks would\
      \ help;\n\nI would give a neutral review since creative mechanics are severely\
      \ held back by quality of level-design. I'd say buy it on sale, I'm intrested\
      \ what people who never played the game think of it. \nThere's also an intersting\
      \ option in the menu to select level packs.... sadly they never released anything\
      \ like that, AFAIK. Would have gladly bought it as DLC"
