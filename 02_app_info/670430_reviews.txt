Got a very rough gist of what the game was trying to relay. May or may not be a better experience if you know Russian. There's not a lot going on anyways. Reuses a lot of the same sound effects and is a very linear experience, keep holding D and click spacebar when prompted with dialog. Quick play time, and due to the broken English it wasn't that great. Had to reload the final decision because the game would bug out and not let me click anything. On top of that the fullscreen mode lets your display scale and doesn't have resolution options. Money better spent elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1590318654,"timestamp_updated":1590318794,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0eCYo/ICeuf6iQI="}
