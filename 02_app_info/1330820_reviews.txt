It is an intuitive game not requiring lots of complicated procedures.  Although the game is nearly 20 years old the graphics are good.  One problem though the animals do not respond to calls unlike in Hunting Unlimited 1.  However, the animals are much easier to shoot than in Hunting Unlimited 1.  Your aim is not forever shaking.  In Hunting Unlimited 1 you had to lie down to get an accurate shot.  All in all I would  certainly recommend this game.   \nnigelj","timestamp_created":1608499423,"timestamp_updated":1608499423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48ayCwfYCe+HmuwI="}
