I got to like lv 8 in 20 mins and replayed some of the other levels back again. And I can say I love it. You let me play your game when it was in alpha, and I instantly like it. I like partially bc you're one of my best friends, but I'm also a sucker for great indie games. When the floating enemy type is introduced it adds a new element that's kind of frustrating but totally manageable, you actually have to think about certain strategies to progress. Overall, 10/10 would recommend. Can't wait for your future products, I'M honestly psyched!!","timestamp_created":1555684180,"timestamp_updated":1555684180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1555689375,"developer_response":"Thank you for the feedback!
