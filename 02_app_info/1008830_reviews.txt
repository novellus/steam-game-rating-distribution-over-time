The music you do here is minimalist and dull.\n\nThe core game play - the combat and platforming - isn't good. Your primary attack has no range, leaves you vulnerable when you use it, and enemies are far too plentiful. For as short as this game is, you will die. Many many times. It just isn't fun. What does this challenge give me? Interesting characters and plot development? No. Detailed and varied environments to explore? No. Nothing. The \"less is more\" approach fails with this because this game has nothing in it. And I grew up playing 8 bit platformers. This isn't Rad Gravity or Vice or Shadow of the Ninja or Blaster Master. It's a waste of a dollar.\n\nGo play Blaster Master Zero. Go play Momodora. Go play The Vagrant. Don't waste your money on this.\n","timestamp_created":1609733920,"timestamp_updated":1609733920,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0Mrn5fYCffOkwAI="}
