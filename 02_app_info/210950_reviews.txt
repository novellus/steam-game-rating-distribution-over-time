I was afraid that having played best 2011+ games I won't be able to enjoy again this magnificent, uncomparable, amazing, breathtaking and the classiest game ever (yeah, this one was my first PC game). But it turned out to be OK. I admit my eyes were bleeding the first 5 min while getting used to the graphics, but it can still absorb the player! Oh, I'm sooo damn glad it can! I came across two problems: 1) I forgot how to cut heads off the green-eyed deadmen; 2) there were some troubles with loading saved games (I made it right by starting a new game -> then all the savings are available).","timestamp_created":1609008358,"timestamp_updated":1609023909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yI3T0PYCf4W9vQI="}
