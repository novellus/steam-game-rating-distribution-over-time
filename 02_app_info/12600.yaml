    review: "This is my review of this game titled: Midnight Outlaw 6 Hours To Sunup.\n\
      \nOk I want to start off by saying that I indeed bought this game on steam and\
      \ when proceeded to download and install and launched I was quite surprised\
      \ to find out that another game similar to this is named - Top Gear RPM Tuning\
      \ and is exactly the same game. Now both games have issues working proper on\
      \ modern day windows/systems (beware people) and mind the other reviews on here\
      \ about this one because whatever issues it has with newer operating systems\
      \ (as mentioned) they are very true. However I did get the game to work with\
      \ no problems but you must jump thru hoops in order to do so, skipping the video\
      \ intro sequence by pushing the \"return key\" on the keyboard is a essential\
      \ action to do so then the game won't crash (most times) and setting compatibility\
      \ modes are necessary. Now the biggest issue as far as running this game on\
      \ the current hardware that I have \"when actually playing it\" is the maps\
      \ graphics walls/structures/scenery seem to disappear at will, almost seems\
      \ like the game is drawing the stuff on the map on the go? But again that alone\
      \ is a sign of a very old game the way it was created. The way this is fixed\
      \ as a quick solution is by hitting the cars nitro, as this lights up the screen\
      \ and somehow that triggers the drawing of the game's graphics to render faster\
      \ then the track and everything around you comes into full view again (for a\
      \ couple of seconds) and then you must hit nitro again over and over each and\
      \ everytime the graphics/track disappears just to rectify that problem. Aside\
      \ from those issues mentioned above here is some good things about this game,\
      \ surprisingly for how old this game really is it did recognize my Logitech\
      \ wireless controller which I thought it would never be able to do. Also this\
      \ is a fun street racing game to play, for its generation and considering back\
      \ in the day it might have been impressive to look at at one point. If you see\
      \ the screenshots and videos of this and you think it looks cool - Your not\
      \ mistaken. Infact to be honest I actually played it (quick race mode) for a\
      \ couple of hours (despite all the problems mentioned above) and it did keep\
      \ me entertained for the most part. Underneath all the huge unplayability factors\
      \ is a nice little street racing game \"that needs to updated majorly to fit\
      \ today's standards\" with lots of cool features to have fun with. Valusoft\
      \ prob won't do any updates anytime soon with this game anymore since the company\
      \ might have went belly up out of business a long time ago, and if someone had\
      \ the time to fix it (as a personal project) they would have already done it\
      \ by now a long time ago. But the problem is no one really cared about this\
      \ game when it was abandoned so a lot of time would be put in to rectify all\
      \ the above and I guess no one feels it is important enough to follow up on.\
      \ Some of the creators that are still around are prob very aware of the universal\
      \ issues with the different hardware and the game's compatibility issues with\
      \ newer windows and such, but they do not feel its something they must do to\
      \ try to make a competitor out of this with the current market of \"newer\"\
      \ racing games with nicer graphics and gameplay that are relevant and available\
      \ these days - I honestly don't blame them.      \n\nWhat else is there to say?\n\
      \nThe cars handle well with good comfortable arcade like style physics/controls.\
      \ The maps are nice but a little bland for my taste. The music being played\
      \ per race is catchy and pretty standard dance tracks (not sure if they are\
      \ real dance tacks or just composed by a random person). Then there is the other\
      \ cars you see your opponents driving that look powerful and fast enough to\
      \ win by a landslide but the AI in this game proves that theory wrong. The amount\
      \ of cars available in this game to drive are not a vast whole lot to choose\
      \ from so its really up to you how you wanna tune them and that part I found\
      \ really innovative though as there a are at least 3 or 4 different upgrades\
      \ for each tier of car parts. Like I said there is a hidden gem here but only\
      \ if someone has the time to find it and remodel this gem.\n\nBTW: I do have\
      \ RPM Tuning as well and yes if you been hearing that that game is in Russian\
      \ - You are correct! It is on Abandonware site for download. I have made adjustments\
      \ to the game's original exe overwriting it with the one from a demo version\
      \ and it fixed that problem now the only thing is the graphics glitches (mentioned\
      \ above earlier) which I will try and see if I can tinker with that. With that\
      \ all being said I really hope that one day someone can update this game to\
      \ be working on newer hardware as intended but that day won't come. Leaving\
      \ this game as it is with the graphics glitchy - it looks like the whole city\
      \ got hit by an atomic bomb.\n\nI won't recommend this to anyone to download\
      \ just because the fact it has not been updated/formatted to work on modern\
      \ systems and the price tag of this should be a lot lower if not, even free\
      \ dare I say. Its a nice fun street racer game but really old and games that\
      \ are this old should not have a heavy price tag on them just because of the\
      \ universal compatibility issues alone."
