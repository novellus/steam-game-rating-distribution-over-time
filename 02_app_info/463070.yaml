    reviews: "\u201CMecha Ritz: Steel Rondo is a wonderful little game. The pixel\
      \ art is strong, wiry, and grainy. The FM Synth soundtrack creates an effect\
      \ like watching an 80s action movie on a dusty VHS cassette. The cherry on top\
      \ is fast-paced dodge-and-destroy gameplay against a rogues gallery of killer\
      \ robots.\u201D<br>7/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamespew.com/2016/06/mecha-ritz-steel-rondo-review/\"\
