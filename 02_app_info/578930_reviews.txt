The game itself if isn't difficult at all but it is rather enjoyable playing each level as it's uniquely designed with a different soundtrack for each level. Looking at some of the other reviews, they found that the game is more challenging and difficult than I personally perceived. If you're looking for a hard-set difficult platformer game, I would suggest something more like Spelunky or Noita- but, if you're looking for something to sit back and relax, this is a great game just for that. The checkpoint system as part of unlimited is great for that specific purpose but the game offers more challenging modes. Overall, I would highly suggest this game as it's wonderfully created with the melodic soundtrack and the original design for each and every level.","timestamp_created":1609399258,"timestamp_updated":1609399258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwufnq2/YCduaDvwI="}
