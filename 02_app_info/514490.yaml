    about_the_game: '<strong>Ultimate Word Search 2: Letter Boxed</strong> takes you
      into a world of mystery where your task is to locate hidden words in a matrix
      of letters. Each matrix contain words that wrap around a 3D-cube going left,
      right, up and down. There are 24 words to discover and the game includes 84
      English word categories featuring random words from a large vocabulary of options.
      To select a word you touch the first letter of the word. Then touch the last
      letter of the word. You can and may need to spin the cube in between touching
      the letters. You can actually touch the last letter first and first last. Words
      can go left, right, up or down so look for them in reverse order as well. Often,
      the words you need to find will wrap around the sides of the cube adding to
      the fun. No game will ever play the same and only true wordsmiths will beat
      this ultimate word-challenge.<h2 class="bb_tag">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>84

    review: Ugh, horrible. No instruction, the controls are confusing, you can't even
      tell if you're playing it right. The letters light up as you click them one
      by one, but stop lighting up as you click the next. You can't "drag" click,
      or it spins the cube around. So did it get the word or not? I love word games,
      and the idea is good, but the execution is horrible. Don't waste your time.
