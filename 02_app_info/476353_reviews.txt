This quickly gets boring and value is just not there.  Wanted to like it but went to play a buddy and couldn't because we didn't have a third player.  Maybe they need to have a AI option.  Not sure but until this game gets a big following or finds a weigh to not require at least three people.  Then don't bother.","timestamp_created":1482604805,"timestamp_updated":1482604805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421455949544906616","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uL+ImdkCcr+PbQ=="}
