I wish I had this years ago. I love all things Jane Austen and the tongue-in-cheek vibe is ridiculously fun. There's a multi-player mode so you can play locally with friends. I haven't done much with that (still in the middle of a pandemic at the time of this writing) but I'm looking forward to introducing this to all of my fellow Jane Austen friends as soon as possible. Definitely worth it for the experience!","timestamp_created":1608828253,"timestamp_updated":1608828253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tN7oyvYCeOnovAI="}
