I thoroughly enjoyed playing it, and recommend adding it to your HOPA library.  I wish more games could be like this. I note I'm biased toward historical and/or mythical settings.\n\nPros:\n- smooth interface\n- lovely art (resolution may be a little grainy at times in cut scenes, but not bad)\n- good HO scenes (word lists with some items having an extra \"step\"; also silhouette HO puzzles)\n- an excellent variety of puzzles, ranging from easy to moderately challenging (no line tracing or similar annoyances)\n- a coherent story and sensible object placement; appropriate historical objects used\n- strong voice acting\n- in-game guide; that said, I never used it, which indicates a good game\n\nNeutral:\n- the alchemy mechanic/mini-game was good at first, but got tedious\n- no Steam achievements or trading cards; however, the in-game achievements were more interesting than usual\n- no indicator for collectibles (however, there is just one thing to collect, and it's there in every location; I got them all in my first play-through without using the in-game guide)\n\nCons:\n- almost all the HO scenes are used twice; this doesn't bother me personally, but should be noted\n\nThis was a 10/10 for me.\n","timestamp_created":1595593732,"timestamp_updated":1595593732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608163237571716309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+oWzwPMCdOihlwI="}
