The visuals are beautiful and the gameplay simple but rewarding. The only issue i can find is that it is badly written. Not the whole game, mind you, just the dialogue between the two main characters. They have no chemistry, they are stiff and wooden. The other character you meet, and even the notes you find on the ground, flow better than the dialogue between the two main characters. This is a small complain though. The game as a whole is beautiful, haunting, thought-provoking, and overall worth your time.","timestamp_created":1609218702,"timestamp_updated":1609218702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518716573715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq5e61vYCdtirvgI="}
