Automatically to edge of play area, which for most people is a wall.\n\nUPDATE: They have fixed the table location issue. Still kind of a bummer you can't adjust the table position, but now I am able to play. Not sure if this will be more difficult for those with smaller play areas, but it works for me!","timestamp_created":1532798300,"timestamp_updated":1537141501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xL2x8uUCdYOLpwE="}
