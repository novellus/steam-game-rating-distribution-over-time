    review: "Do you like Metroidvanias but perhaps want to kick those socks off and\
      \ just be casual for a while?\nThen I'd recommend this one for you! \n\nIt's\
      \ a quite short game with a pretty straightforward gameplay with some puzzlesolving\
      \ thrown in, the overall mechanics\nare easy to learn aswell and also doesn't\
      \ require that much effort to master.\n\nStory is nice, keeps you curious and\
      \ plot points aren't far apart so you always feel you're making some kind of\
      \ progress, be it upgrades for your sub or just plot advancement. \n\nAll in\
      \ all It's a cute, short and well made little game perfect to just relax to."
