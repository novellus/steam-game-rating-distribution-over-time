    about_the_game: "Mithral Gun: Biomechanical is a single-player game of action\
      \ survival. It tells the story of a dispute between robots and humans at the\
      \ end of the 24th century, in which players as BIOs of mechanical girls survived\
      \ in the battlefield.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame play is based on survival and\
      \ combat. Unlike traditional survival games, players control robots without\
      \ food and water, they need power and energy; the damage of robots can not be\
      \ recovered naturally, they need to find materials to repair, but also can make\
      \ more detailed modifications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe background of the game\
      \ is in the period of war between man and robot. As the protagonist of robots\
      \ and human and robotic forces are in a hostile state, players need to survive\
      \ in a war zone full of hostile forces, or become friends with one force, relying\
      \ on other forces to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers can find all kinds\
      \ of weapons and equipment available in the ruins. Weapons themselves have durability\
      \ settings, each repair will gradually reduce the durability limit, which requires\
      \ a reasonable arrangement of the use of weapons and material consumption, through\
      \ a variety of tactical ways to solve the enemy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game\
      \ contains certain random elements. Every time a player starts a new game, the\
      \ map changes: for example, the location of the NPC and the safe house changes\
      \ randomly, and enemies in some areas also differ."
