Particularly nice is the ability to make things a bit darker since the default runs a bit washed out and bright. There is something unsavory about locking 5 ball mode away when the original table text clearly says that you get 5 per play but you only get 3 without this DLC. Helps just to consider acquiring this the actual price of a very good game.","timestamp_created":1586407527,"timestamp_updated":1586407527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pbrQrvECfNSq/wE="}
