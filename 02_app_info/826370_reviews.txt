The protagonist in The Silver Arrow is a descendant of both the princess in the original game in the series, and the princess in the previous game (The Dark Minotaur).  As in prior games, you come across portraits of your \"famous\" ancestresses, which is a nice touch of continuity.  The villains of the piece also continue over from earlier games.\n\nPros:\n- choice of three difficulty settings\n- first game in the series available in widescreen\n- first game in the series to have a map (and it is fully interactive)\n- lovely art and good story\n- excellent bonus chapter\n- music is improved from the first three games\n- puzzles are varied and interesting (difficulty can be selected for some puzzles)\n- in-game achievements and an \"achievement room\"\n- hidden pearls that can be used to upgrade your personal tower room (I enjoyed this)\n\nCons:\n- too many HO scenes require you to find \"pairs\" or \"connected pairs\" of objects; too few regular or shape-based HO scenes (although some of the interactive HO scenes are quite good)\n\n[b]Overall:[/b] This is an excellent series, despite the first three games having a distinctly older look and feel.  This game is the best in terms of graphics, options, and bonuses.  My only disappointment was with the \"matching objects\" HO scenes.  I'm surprised the series doesn't have more reviews on Steam, and I'm glad I decided to try it out.  Well worth adding to your HOPA collection, although I'd always suggest buying on sale or at least in the bundle.","timestamp_created":1606104720,"timestamp_updated":1606104720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqKTT+fUCe6GAsAI="}
