    about_the_game: "A fantastical 5E bestiary of fey and undead!<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nA good game can never have enough monsters, and the Coldwood Codex brings\
      \ you 10 brand-new creatures suitable for use in any 5th Edition campaign, especially\
      \ if your heroes are wandering in search of their fortune through the cold,\
      \ desolate woods of the northern wilds. These creatures add a delightful bit\
      \ of novel menace equally split between fey spirits bursting with the raw and\
      \ wild energies of life and vile undead seething with the power of death. Drawing\
      \ upon real-world folklore, classic fantasy tropes, and the design skills of\
      \ the top creative minds in the business, the Coldwood Codex is an indispensable\
      \ addition to any GM's monster toolkit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRequires: 5E ruleset<br\
