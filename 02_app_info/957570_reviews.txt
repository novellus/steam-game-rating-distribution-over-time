It is a combination of the old tabletop hex style tactics games like Starship  Troopers and fantasy games like Dungeons and Dragons.  It is quite challenging.  I would call this a hardcore game.  Much less of a generalist.  I like it because it is very challenging.  I have finished three campaigns so far in the last two days.  It took me a little while to understand the mechanics.  They should have a few lets play Youtube videos.  \n","timestamp_created":1608954664,"timestamp_updated":1608954664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxPrKzvYCcsmhvQI="}
