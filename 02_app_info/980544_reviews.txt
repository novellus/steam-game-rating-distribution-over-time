The route is well done and even better models the 1940s. At least 30 types of rolling stock are included, including low poly for yards. It comes with F7s (Entirely new model, NOT reskin), a challenger(Also new), and a big boy(Same as the other two) Overall this is an amazing route and a must-buy.","timestamp_created":1606950093,"timestamp_updated":1606950093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jJDskvYCdJrvtgI="}
