So it was literally unplayable for a while.\n\nEven if he gets it fixed, a game that you may not be able to play for weeks at a time isn't worth the $20 price tag. I'd pass on this if I were you. Devs a cool guy, and I wish him luck on future endeavors, but this one looks like it's rapidly flopping. That, and even with an ample description like \"Enemies aren't spawning in this dungeon, <Insert dungeon name>\", he'd ask for a video or screenshot. I mean, sure but... it's your game, I'd think you'd just be able to hop on and go to that dungeon and fix it. Not a big deal, but we did pay to bug test, and hindering that isn't wise.\n*Update* \nNo new content in over 6 months. Game is dead.\n\n*Update*\nServers are down again. \nNegative review is obviously earned.\n\n*Update*\nDev and I had a long talk about the lag issues, and I see him posting the same reply on here that he gave me in the disc: \"Many players don't have that issue\". \nMeanwhile, I've yet to talk to anyone that the game ran smoothly for. Soooo... He's full of it. <3 \n\nRapidly losing respect for this dev, won't be buying anything he has a hand in unless the reviews show he's changed how he handles constructive criticism.","timestamp_created":1554692567,"timestamp_updated":1597959810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535398244857788086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvfX0hvQCeN7pvgE="}
