The movement of the plants in the wind is very well done. Make sure to look around so you do not miss any of the animals. Selections for time of day are very nice and my preference was morning which I really enjoyed.\nTried first with Ultra graphics but did not do so well with a Nvidia GTX 1060 so I changed it to Detailed and it played fine. You really need a XBox or Steam controller because I can not see how you can adjust with Keyboard settings with a Headset on unless you use it before you start the journey. Would be nice to be able to use Headset Wand controllers.\nIf you enjoy a Beautiful and Meditative experience. You will enjoy ZendoVR. Good Price too.\nThank you very Much","timestamp_created":1605543603,"timestamp_updated":1606807965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41PnNjvYCduzfrgI="}
