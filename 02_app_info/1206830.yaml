      and equipment, new rules for bonded mounts, and paladin kits like the divinate,
      envoy, ghosthunter, skyrider, and the indomitable wyrmslayer.<br><br>The Complete
      Paladin''s Handbook attends the world''s finest heroes as they achieve their
      lofty ideals.<h2 class="bb_tag">Product History</h2><br><i>PHBR12: The Complete
      Paladin''s Handbook</i> (1994) is by Rick Swan, the same author as PHBR11: The
      Complete Ranger''s Handbook and the man who previously penned Nightmare Keep,
      an adventure that takes place inside the body of a petrified lich. The authorship
      is fortunate, as writing skill is needed when approaching paladins, historically
      considered the most challenging class to play and one that players often needed
      the most advice for. How do you play a lawful good hero who isn''t either stupid
      or a prig? How do you handle a hero with unbreakable morals in a party that
      may contain thieves?<br><br>And perhaps more importantly, how does detect evil
      work without intrinsically spoiling adventures?<br><br>This supplement does
      its best to answer all of these concerns. It approaches the paladin''s ethos,
      discussing the code of ennoblement and the paladin''s virtures and ethics, and
      it walks the player through roleplaying someone who is the embodiment of heroism
      and faith. Mechanically, the supplement gives details on paladin abilities,
      character kits, gear and proficiencies. The result is a well-written and useful
      guide to playing a paladin in 2nd edition AD&amp;D.<br><br><strong>Detect Evil
      is not Radar.</strong> The chapter on paladin abilities starts out with a several
      page discussion of what detect evil can and can''t accomplish. It''s a good
      start to the book, as it addresses one of the misunderstandings and complaints
      that players and DMs run into. By giving specific examples of what detect evil
      feels like and what it can detect, DMs are given tools to help make their adventures
      more fun without shortchanging the paladin''s player.<br><br>This chapter on
      paladin abilities also discusses the paladin''s mount at length, including tables
      for other sorts of appropriate mounts. Want to ride an elephant or a great cat
      into battle? This gives methods for doing so, including training, care, tricks
      and samples of the warhorse quest.<br><br><strong>Doing the Right Thing. </strong>The
      chapter on the paladin''s ethos lays out their strictures, the inviolable rules
      that a lawful good paladin must follow. It draws a distinction between these
      and edicts, the rules that a paladin has pledged to obey but which are given
      to him by his patron. Religion, government and philosophy affect edicts, while
      roleplaying quirks are restrictions that add flavor to a character.<br><br>Finally,
      the chapter discusses virtues, the traits of high morality and decency: Fealty,
      honesty, courtesy, valor, and honor are all virtues. In comparison, the chapter
      also runs through the ways to violate oaths and the typical penalties for doing
      so. Execrable violations such as habitual cowardice are going to strip a paladin
      of his paladinhood, but less severe offenses have lesser penalties. These guidelines
      help DMs and players adjudicate the appropriate responses to possible violations,
      and give players a feel for what''s appropriate when playing a paladin.<br><br><strong>Wait,
      the Inquisitor is a What?</strong> The paladin kits use a combination of mechanical
      and roleplaying hindrances to balance out the mechanical advantages granted
      by the kits. These kits, more than in many other books, help round out the paladin''s
      role in unexpected ways and act to give depth to the character beyond simply
      a knight in shining armor. A diplomatic envoy, a particularly holy warrior for
      a church, a noble knight, a master horseman, a wandering and liege-less hero,
      a soldier, a healer, a ghost-hunter, a sky-rider - the paladin kits are well-balanced,
      interesting, and provide alternative roles for a paladin in the world. Mechanical
      benefits are balanced by a combination of mechanical and role-playing hindrances.<br><br><strong>Joust!</strong>
      I''m a little surprised by the quantity of new rules, such as for new proficiencies
      such as jousting and new gear such as lower-powered holy swords, and new roleplaying
      and campaign-building guidelines, such as the role of faith and fealty in the
      world and the administration of tournaments. Courtly love, economics, strongholds,
      a paladin''s daily activities, holy orders, sample divine orders of paladins
      are all covered in great depth. The appendices even include a bibliography of
      useful reading and the original 1e AD&amp;D paladin.<br><br>This book is without
      question one of the best of the Complete series: Solid and well-balanced mechanically,
      full of flavorful ideas and good advice, it''s a book that paladin players of
      any edition won''t want to miss - and if paladins haven''t traditionally been
      your cup of tea, this is the book that could change that for you too.<br><br><strong>About
