So basically, i had no expectations and was really surprised how good it is. I'm not an expert for writing reviews for movies. Well, to be honest, i don't have the slightest clue about them. But it's a pretty good movie in my opinion and because nobody else has written a review so far, it's a good reason to do it.\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Interesting zombie movie adaptation\n+ Really good and ambitious actors for the roles\n+ Some clever camera angles\n+ It never gets boring or has long \"breaks\"\n+ Really good make up and effects\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Color adjustments could be better sometimes\n- Sometimes the sound is too quiete\n- Some really weird moments\n\n\nHope i haven't forgotten anything important that should be said.\nI will probably buy and see more movies made by Terror Films, they really piqued my interest.","timestamp_created":1532725598,"timestamp_updated":1532726035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586919069290161133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o+jl7uQCeaaDpwE="}
