Its basically Missile Command 2.0 VR.  If you like Missile Command or other arcade games like it and have any sort of access to VR, then this is definitely a must buy.  It takes the classic formula and ramps it up to 1000.  There are all sorts of new things to worry about besides missile leveling your city.  And the graphics look amazing.  This is no triple-A title, but it really made me feel like I was fighting for the lives of all the little people getting blown up in the buildings any time I messed up.  There's no plot unfortunately, I think if they add a story mode down the road that would be AMAZING.  In the meantime I'll keep working on getting to higher and higher difficulty levels.  If there's an end to the madness, I doubt I'll get there as I just don't have the skill.  But dang am I having fun trying.","timestamp_created":1598295944,"timestamp_updated":1598295944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1598308675,"developer_response":"We are so glad you liked the game.
