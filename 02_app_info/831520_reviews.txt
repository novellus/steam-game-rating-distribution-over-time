I got this game for my nephew and he loves it but personally this game is not exactly easy for a kid to play, let alone get the ultimate dino of their dreams- The T-Rex. It requires that you beat all 25 levels and that you get 75 stars. It only continues to get more difficult as you go on to where he has to waste play time for me to get him past a level. As I said.. He loves it, me not so much. (10/10) his rating. (4/10) Mine.","timestamp_created":1593924612,"timestamp_updated":1593924612,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+u3TjvMCcPn0kgI="}
