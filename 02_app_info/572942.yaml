    review: I got this on a sale, and I like the show alright, but... Well, after
      about the second episode, the audio has been messed up. Now, I'm not sure if
      it's my headphones or perhaps an improper download, but it seems to only be
      this show and only the episodes following the second. That being said, it IS
      a fun show to watch.
