RPGMaker has potential, but Unity being a much more universal engine has more potential for polish. I've seen a lot of very nasty reviews on this game simply because of the engine it uses. I don't think the fact that it uses RPGMaker is a fair way to judge the game.\n\n[b][i]Some positives: good soundtrack, decent art design, etc. There is potential for this to be a final release.[/i][/b]\n\nFirst, my biggest complaint: fullscreen is not really fullscreen. And on top of that, the game uses texture filtering on all of the sprites and it looks very ugly. Alot of these issues could be attributed to the fact I'm using Proton + KDE, I have not tested this on Windows and I have no idea if part of this is an engine limitation.\n\nSecond, no quick-saves. Simple as that.\n\nThird, writing is sub-par IMO. Not bad, just not Oscar Award winning material.\n\nI would downvote, but the game is only 99 cents, and on sale it's usually less than 50. It's worth the money. I also just feel really bad for the developers considering some of the unfair criticisms this game has been recieving,\n\nWhile I'm here, I might as well mention that some of the reviews claim that B2B Gaming is a shovelware producer, I don't think this is a fair judgement. There are some games that have some effort put into them, more than this one, mainly Turbo Pug DX.\n\nI honestly hope the game is worked on again sometime soon, possibly even refactored into a new engine, people seem to have not forgotten about it.","timestamp_created":1609807263,"timestamp_updated":1609807395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4i+//5/YCf63HwAI="}
