    review: A retro computer gaming take on the Dark Souls formula. Where it lacks
      in complexity it excels in atmosphere. Challenging enough to keep things interesting,
      but never too hard or frustrating. As a fan of using torches to explore dark
      places in video games, this one is a definite winner, and it's runs on my $200
      potato laptop!
