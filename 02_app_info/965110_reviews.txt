The good point is that it plays smoothely but without mouse support; this is not a twinstick shooter. Other upgrades come in randomly as you kill baddies and roids and difficulty ramps up as you go. \n\nOne of many bosses will come once you reach a certain mark... well made i'd say. Ony one of the ships you unlock has an ability that helps you survive in the long run. There are WAY better flash games out there with proper roguelike upgrading systems which makes this game obsolete and not worth the buy.\n\nThis is still a good effort on the developper's part but it really, really lack some good features found in most games of this genre.","timestamp_created":1543173167,"timestamp_updated":1543173167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+bqSpucCeLOVswE="}
