      Like all of Tonguc''s previous games, this is a walking simulator where you
      walk around a beautiful (and probably partly automatically generated) environment
      while a narrator tells a story that''s mostly unrelated to what you''re seeing.  I
      was hoping maybe he''d decided to innovate for this one, but unfortunately this
      appears to be more of the same, but even worse.


      In my short 10 minutes of playtime, my game crashed once, and got stuck on an
      infinite loading screen once.  Then when playing I only heard the first two
      pieces of dialog; the next one never triggered, and I was unable to get the
      trigger to load the next level working, meaning I was eternally stuck.  This
      happened in one of his previous games too.  I fixed it then by restarting the
      game, but given this was already my third attempt, I gave up.


      Pass on this.  There are LOTS of better walking simulators out there.'
