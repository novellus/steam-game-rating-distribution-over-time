First, if any of you enjoyed the Disgaea series you will instantly fall in love with this. The hours of game play fly by. The humor is even more irreverent and adult than Disgaea.  The airship battles are stunning. The game about making everybody love the main character ends up making everybody outside the game who gives it even half a chance fall in love with the game itself. 60 + hours on the short end of pure gaming pleasure to get the true ending. If done properly, much like Disgaea, the game can stretch onward for 1,000 + hours just finding the upper limits of how you can utterly break the game and seeing just how much damage you can truly inflict. The musical scores are very well done and are as fittingly whimsical as the cast of characters and story. It is easily one of the best games of all time. Don't just take my word for it. Buy this game and experience the joy and madness that is Mugen Souls.","timestamp_created":1605814642,"timestamp_updated":1605814642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1dyA8fUCeoWtrwI="}
