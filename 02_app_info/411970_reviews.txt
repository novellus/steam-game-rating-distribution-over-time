Classic PS2 era platformer that improves upon the formula of the original with better level design and a pseudo-open world. Steam version has touched up graphics, faster load times, higher framerate and unlockable cosmetics as well as improvements to the vehicle steering and aiming. Overall would recommend to anyone looking for a solid 3d platformer","timestamp_created":1610059632,"timestamp_updated":1610059632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2InC7/YCc+aywQI="}
