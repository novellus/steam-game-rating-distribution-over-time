Jump over spikes and avoid buzzsaws. Shoot at enemies with their backs turned. Final boss is about 4-5 shots, so it takes about 2 seconds if you're just holding down left click.

Other than that, just avoid this.","timestamp_created":1606709263,"timestamp_updated":1606709263,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qbfVi/YCcf3OtQI="}
