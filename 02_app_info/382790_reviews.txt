He does this, not with a movie, but an audio book with fractal animations and random shots of trees with limited speculation from other people who drink this stuff. Actual footage is scarce.\n\n[b]Talking Points:[/b]\n\n- The plant metaphorically puts you back into Mother Nature's green womb.\n- The plant makes you see things.\n- The plant makes you sh*t and vomit.\n- \"Spiritual\" experiences\n- \"Cosmic\" visions and spirits\n- The Spanish invasion of the Incan Empire is interpreted as a breaking of celesital connections that should be restored.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b]\n\nLast time I checked, documentaries were supposed to show, not just tell. This is simply an overblown personal experience with no journalistic intent. The scope is so small it's superficial. Even people who are interested in the subject hate this, and will direct you to other sources on this topic. Stay far away from this 89 minute blog post. It was hilarious to see him exaggerate his DMT trips.\n\n[b]1/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1437692746,"timestamp_updated":1564203173,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":81,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.770504176616668701","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yMjxmOwCeaDMQQ=="}
