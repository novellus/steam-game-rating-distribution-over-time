For the start two rare items and a golden legendary that will be used for a very long time. For me playing this game for about 6,650 hours it's a good start for the dlc items, Even old crusaders over event ones are still useful depending on the stage.","timestamp_created":1518737094,"timestamp_updated":1518737094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw157yzeECeuqBmQE="}
