    review: 'I want to say this is the worst game ever made, but then I pause to consider
      where this game stands among the hundreds of other "worst game ever" that I''ve
      played. I have concluded that trying to figure out the "worst" of all the bad
      games is like picking up different pieces of poo in the off-leash dog park and
      smelling them all, trying to figure out the worst. Well, if you follow me, they''re
      all crap so who cares which is the worst?


      Let''s start with the fact that on a GTX 1070Ti this game runs the way Quake
      I used to run on a 386 with no graphics card. No instructions, no settings,
      no controller rebinding, nothing.


      The game starts and the tutorial tells you how to walk forward with the Thumbstick.
      Great! Next you meet an enemy and the floating tutorial text says to attack
      the enemy you see before you. None of the gamepad inputs will cause the attack...
      so what''s going on? All the other gamepad inputs work... Jumping... crawling...
      rolling... but not attack? Ok fine, I have a Steam Controller so I''ll rebind
      the (X) key to LMB so attack works.


      So I walk into the enemy and start hammering the attack button. There is no
      skill to combat, no managing distance, no anticipating or avoiding attacks.
      Nope, combat consists of pressing the Attack input until the foe dies.


      I should mention again, that even at lowest possible detail settings, the game
      is running at about 12 FPS on my gaming rig.


      Next I get to a series of floating platforms. Uh oh! I missed the platform and
      it sailed away. I guess I''ll wait for it. So then I stand there for 30 seconds
      waiting for the platform to return. Finally it comes back and I mount it and
      wait for the ascent. Another 30 seconds of waiting. Oh boy! After I get off
      the first platform, another floating platform! But this one''s timing has gone
      off synchronization and I missed it. So now I wait another 30 seconds for it
      to return, and the corresponding 30 seconds while I wait for it to elevate me
      to the next area.


      It as at this point that I get up to pour myself a coffee and when I come back
      I''m not on the floating platform anymore, now I''m back at the start of the
      game. What has happened? Oh well, another 5 minutes of tediously proceeding
      back to regain my progress.


      Then I get to a gap in the level, and you cannot jump it, you cannot roll across
      it, there is no alternate path. This is a 2.5D game where you can only go in
      one direction. Should be called a 1.5D game. After thrashing at the controls
      for 2 minutes to try to figure out how to get the avatar over the pit, I go
      inside hoping he will crawl up when he gets to the other side as he did once
      before in the earlier part of the map. Nope. Now I''m stuck in the pit forever.


      I restart the "game" and suffer the tedious 5 minutes of basically standing
      and waiting on platforms to get back up there. Same problem. Oh did I mention
      that on the way up there I see another enemy with floating tutorial text, but
      the text is backwards... I guess because the dev never played or tested this
      once? "KCATTA OT BML SSERP"... that''s the tutorial text.


      This game is the ultimate piece of poo. I bought it because I thought it looked
      amateur as heck but I guessed there might be something worthwhile even at the
      90% off I paid. WRONGO! Normally I let developers keep my 50 cents for these
      shabby games, but not this time. Give me my two quarters back, and I''ll spend
      them on gumballs.
