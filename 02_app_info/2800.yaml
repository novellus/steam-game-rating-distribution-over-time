    review: 'A no-frills space-themed economic simulator! At least, the way I play
      it. There is combat involved, too, but I''m more for the trading side of it.
      Let me run my stations in peace!


      Okay, for reals; the sheer variety of spaceship and economic trading is fascinating,
      and while I haven''t delved too deeply into the combat aspect I can already
      see it has plenty of potential. Turrets, missiles, lasers and the ability to
      decide the function of all of these for oneself. Not to mention the different
      aspects of the ships! My only complaint with this is that the more potent ships
      are inordinately expensive, meaning your economic strength will be tested first
      and foremost. Fine for me, but it can take... a while.'
