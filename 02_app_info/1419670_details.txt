All adopted by the same man. <br>Your mission is to save The Unknown World from getting infected and find the source of the virus before everyone gets sick! <br>But that's not just it! You also have an even more important mission! Get everyone a Halloween costume! You will definitely have some trouble getting them all  due to the stupid invading viruses and Jason Dalil's sexiness, but don't let them stop you from bringing back the spirit of Halloween!

BEFORE YOU PLAY: This game is not intended for anyone of the age of 12 or below and may contain sensitive subjects to certain people, and not to mention it contains a shitty humor which not everyone will be able to tolerate, so don't play this game if you can't stand strong mature humor, but most importantly: I DON'T want anyone with a case of photosensitive epilepsy or anyone who is susceptible to a seizure to play this.
