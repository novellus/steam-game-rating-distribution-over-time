The controls are very satisfying and responsive. I love the little touches like the animation where the player puts her hand up in the air when you jump and also the bullet effects are great. It runs very smooth and even the longest game wont take you more than a few rewarding minutes to play. The tracks are always randomly generated so this boosts the replayabilty immensely. Sometimes you just have really bad luck and you can't seem to get the jump timings right and other games are amazing and everything just falls into place. If you want to play a well made original indie game that is a lot of fun and keeps giving you that \"One my try\" feeling then you can't go wrong with Cartacombs for a couple of dollars.","timestamp_created":1550891122,"timestamp_updated":1550891122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Y+UjOkCff7GuwE="}
