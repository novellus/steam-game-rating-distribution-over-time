      There are a lot of new platformers out there, so I usually look for at least\
      \ one unique feature before I consider playing one. In the case of Mike Dies,\

    review: 'A definite recommendation.  The game starts off feeling like a simple
      puzzle platformer or metroidvania but evolves into an exciting test of skill
      with a story tying the different mechanics together.  The only hinder to your
      progress is your mastery of the controls, and as you progress there are a variety
      of new obstacles to master.  The pacing is great and the only rooms I found
      frustrating were optional side tracks.  The devs managed to pack a lot of content
      into a game that only takes a few hours to complete (plus a few more if you''re
      going for 100% completion).


      Pros:

      * Interesting but non-intrusive storyline

      * Solid mechanics and pacing

      * A variety of obstacles


      Cons:

      * The player interaction with platforms can get a bit wonky

      * The story feels a bit weak at the start [spoiler]particularly with the angel
      and demon whose purpose to the story wasn''t clear[/spoiler]


      Overall, this is a should play for anyone who wants to spend a day or two with
      a great game!'
