It doesn't work to just run over the object like in a Zelda-style game.\n\nI've gotten a lot more play out of games I picked up on sale for 49 cents and this never goes lower than a dollar and 79 cents, so I'm tempted to return this after finishing in less than an hour and not having much fun, and suffering from rather than enjoying the music.  It does have some redeeming qualities, though: it does exactly what is shown on the store page; it provides a unique brain exercise; and there probably was enough effort in the artwork and effects to be worth a couple bucks.\n\nSo I'll keep it.  But I'm not recommending it as a game.  It may be worthwhile as a UI experiment and as kinetic art.  It may also be worthwhile as a mental exercise in focus and tolerance of tedium and irritation, which could help when preparing to endure certification tests and the like.","timestamp_created":1609571451,"timestamp_updated":1609571451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h+j74PYCftLSvwI="}
