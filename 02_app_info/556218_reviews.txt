The Typhoon looks a bit odd and a bit rough around the edges, don't expect any advanced texturing or smooth lines. For whatever reason, the Tempest flies like a dog and doesn't feel at all realistic, even though it looks the best with all the surface detailing. All in all, a mixed bag but lots of fun to be had.","timestamp_created":1609161026,"timestamp_updated":1609161026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnZXe1PYCfqqMvgI="}
