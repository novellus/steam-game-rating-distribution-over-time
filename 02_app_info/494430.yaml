    about_the_game: "Praey for the Gods is a boss climbing open world adventure game\
      \ where you play as a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying frozen world to\
      \ discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the\
      \ clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter.\
      \ To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced\
      \ with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

    review: I loved this game. It still needs a bit of polish, and they are still
      gonna add 2 more bosses, but I like how it keeps the essence from Shadow of
      the Colossus plus adding something new like the survival and rpg aspects of
      the game. Also, there is no particular order to kill the bosses, I found most
      of them while exploring the map and I actually liked that.
