It feels like a lot of wasted potential. I played it awhile back and it started out good, but as the game progressed things gradually got worse.\n\nFirst is the fighting mechanics. This mechanic can tend to be a little wearing on your mouse, but a problem becomes especially noticeable when the check-points in the game are set a little too far apart.\nThe reason why this is such a crucial problem is that check-points here are placed at such sporadic distances in the levels, with certain segments being short and easy with the section right after it being soul-crushingly long.\n\nAnd lastly there is the story. It's not terrible to be precise, the HUGE problem though is the ending of this story. When you get to the final boss fight so much of this feels rushed and is very confusing at first. I had to play through the game twice just to understand what even happened.\n\nNow, in spite of all this, this game is not the absolute worst. Considering that it is relatively cheap and was made by a few people as a more amateur project it wouldn't hurt to buy it, and on top of that it can be quite fun to play. However, bugs and glitches aside, the main thing that ruins this game is that it tries to be something bigger than it is, and with its rushed story, this only worsens the game.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean here at all, I really do want this to be great, I really do but it just doesn't make the cut.","timestamp_created":1609218491,"timestamp_updated":1609747010,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwncKZ5vYCfsyrvgI="}
