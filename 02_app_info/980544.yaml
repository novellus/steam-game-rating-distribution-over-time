    review: One of my favorite routes. The route is well done and even better models
      the 1940s. At least 30 types of rolling stock are included, including low poly
      for yards. It comes with F7s (Entirely new model, NOT reskin), a challenger(Also
      new), and a big boy(Same as the other two) Overall this is an amazing route
      and a must-buy.
