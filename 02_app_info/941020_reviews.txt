The characters being based on national Filipino heroes is definitely an interesting take! I already can't wait to hear the lore of individual characters and I hope they will find their inspiration from their true stories in some way. There are a lot of things I can nitpick of course, especially with its current UI, but it is admittedly in its early stages so I expect the developers have those issues in mind already and under a schedule hopefully.\n\nI play with my keyboard and one of the most notable issues I've come across so far has to do with guessing which keys do which. I don't mean the move list (although the chart explaining them could look more organized and explained more) but there are at least three buttons I've found so far that all mean \"confirm\". And I found them by clicking every key in my keyboard, checking if one works. I've yet to figure out what \"return\" key is. And navigating through the UI switches between using the mouse and using the keyboard, it was a li'l frustrating at first. I hope they'll be able to add those \"Press Esc to return\" instructions somewhere in the screen so it's easier to navigate through the menu and options. (^â–½^;) Then again, it might just be because it's my first fighting game played on a keyboard and those keys are considered the \"standard\" keys fighting-gamers would know by hand but if that's the case, I hope they work on also making it more user friendly to players new to the genre. \n\nOverall, as expected from a game in early access, it's definitely still rough around the edges. But the concept and idea is definitely one I haven't seen before and I'm really excited to find a game that sheds light on the Philippine's rich culture. I hope those behind storybuilding will continue to develop a unique story line, one that takes a lot of inspiration from real Filipino stories, that we haven't seen in other fighting games before. Best of luck to the dev team and keep up the good work!","timestamp_created":1606891197,"timestamp_updated":1606891197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4pLqLkfYCd7fYtgI="}
