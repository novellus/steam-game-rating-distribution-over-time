    review: "Rytmic is great and Windows is annoying.  People may not know how to\
      \ use a DAW like this.  It should be a workhorse computer with NO frills or\
      \ games on it.  Seriously.  NO GAMES.  DAW no like share.  Live performance\
      \ is intensive.  Your work computer should be for WORK only.  Take your music\
      \ seriously.  Here's how to make it work:\n1. Disable system sounds\n2. Adjust\
      \ your processor scheduling to Background Services\n3. Adjust your PC\u2019\
      s power options to high performance\n4. Make sure your PC doesn\u2019t suspend\
      \ your USB devices\n5. Disable Windows Background Apps\n6. Disable Windows Updates\n\
      7. Turn of Windows Firewall and anti-virus apps\n8. Switch off animated windows\n\
      9. Switch off your screensaver\n10. ~ 12. Update Drivers!  Reset and double\
      \ check.\n13. Turn off USB power management\n14. Optimize hard disk\n15. Disable\
      \ user account control\n16. Disable Fast Boot\n17. Close all programs you\u2019\
      re not using\n18. Disconnect any USB devices you\u2019re not using.  Sometime\
      \ the controller can be the issue.\n19. Try not to use USB hubs\n20. Run your\
      \ DAW as an Administrator\nTY to Bandzoogle for that quick list of basics. \
      \ There is a lot more you can do with overclocking, etc. but I'm not getting\
      \ into that.\n\nRytmic Live is good.  It deserves better than the other review\
      \ here which sound inexperienced.  I've played electronica live with Acid /\
      \ Sound Forge, Ableton and got so sick of it.  I got a DS-10 KORG on my phone\
      \ to use instead & it was more reliable.  Thus far I find Rytmic to be about\
      \ as reliable as Ableton, and for the price difference that means a lot.  Ableton\
      \ seems to have more bugs and be more complex that needed unless doing in-house\
      \ production.  Ableton Live is a scam.  It fails live, too!  Want reliability?\
      \  Get a computer and dedicate it to ONLY music.  This issues are not with the\
      \ software as much as the OS.  This is why so many use Apple, but as it's basically\
      \ become a company sympathizing with the culling & genocide taking place in\
      \ China, they won't be around much longer.  Rytmic is a great alternative to\
      \ having physical instruments, but I would still use both playin live.\n\nIf\
      \ I ever play a show again I will post how it goes.  For the time being, it\
      \ sure sounds sweet live from my living room.\n\n"
