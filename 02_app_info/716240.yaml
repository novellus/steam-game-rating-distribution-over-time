    review: I hate to give a thumbs down to anything after developers have worked
      so hard creating an app, so I gave this a thumbs up. The puzzles, themselves,
      were quite good. I did not like the fact that I had to go all the way back to
      the beginning of a chapter when I began to play again. Also, the perspective
      would sometimes go from ground level to above ground level, and trying to pick
      something up from the ground was problematic. I could have used some hints,
      but luckily, there was some help in the discussions, and I was able to get some
      help by asking a couple of questions in the discussions. If you like mystery
      puzzle apps, and are willing to put up with the couple of things I mentioned
      here, then you should play this app.
