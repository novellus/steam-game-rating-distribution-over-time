The camera movement is really weird (mouse moves tilt your head more than turning it) but the developer is pretty into it and it has some good potential as a 3D life simulator. Probably wont be much to speak of until Q2 2019 but if you like voxel games and life sims it'll probably be good someday. I'll keep it instead of returning just to support the makers and will check back often for updates. I'm going with 'Recommended' because I've seen much, much worse in an alpha game and good developer interest.\n\nEDIT: Already seems like a crappy moneygrab abandonware. No updates or posts since launch.","timestamp_created":1541281188,"timestamp_updated":1544481066,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525080084800720215","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1544931237,"developer_response":"We understand your frustration in the lack of updates, and we are sorry about the long wait. It should be known, however, the the game itself is under an overhaul. We have been working out some kinks in a building system as of late and are trying our best to release v2.0.0 Christmas. Thank you for your review.\n\n_trackC Team"}],"cursor":"AoJwwdmPzecCccb+rQE="}
