If I could move around freely myself and attack enemies manually...this would get a more positive review.\n\nThis is a solid concept for a game, I would like to see a sequel iron out some of the concepts a bit more","timestamp_created":1594540412,"timestamp_updated":1594540412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxvmAofMCfIPglAI="}
