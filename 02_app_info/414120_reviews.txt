This game blew me away cos i could create anything i want like Vehicles, Cranes, Cannons, Houses, Furnitures and even my own weapons in VR. You can import your own assets like models, textures, images, videos, audio and even humanoid avatars. Game has a workshop support where you can subscribe and download Assets and Creations like coop/singleplayer campaign, deathmatch, VR giant VS non-VR player, Prop hunt or some creations where you just mess around in it. \n\nOverall i really like this game. Community in this is very nice and Developers are awesome.","timestamp_created":1607255870,"timestamp_updated":1607257168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550408720970153809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwiMP/m/YCeL/etwI="}
