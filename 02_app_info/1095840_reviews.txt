And for about 6 or 7 hours, it's fun. But I'd also like to give it a thumbs down, because it quickly becomes boring...VERY boring. It's as repetitive as heck. And although there are in-game achievements, there are NO Steam achievements to give incentive to play thru to the end. I've played for over 10 hours, and I see no end to this tiring repetition.\n\nI would only recommend this to people who are crazy about card solitaire, and ONLY when it's marked down cheap. You'll get SOME fun out of it. Then you'll do what I am doing, and uninstall it well before you're done.","timestamp_created":1584204580,"timestamp_updated":1584204580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyvD87PACdY2M+AE="}
