      [b]tangrams deluxe[/b] contains [b]243 tangram puzzles[/b]. the goal is to place
      7 shapes within an outline and without overlap to create various bigger shapes
      resembling animals, buildings, letters, numbers and other things. using the
      same shapes over and over again might sound repetitive, and while it most definitely
      is, it''s also pretty cool to see how many variations the developers came up
      with, and the [b]drawings after solved puzzles bring the shapes to life[/b],
      which is a really nice touch.


      [b]controls work very well[/b], hold left click to move pieces, rotate with
      right click or mouse wheel while holding a piece, or left or right click or
      mouse wheel while the cursor is above a piece. controller also works, and no
      need to be 100% precise with placement, close enough is close enough, though
      [b]pieces not snapping to their place, whether they''re in the right place or
      not, can be a potential issue for some players[/b].


      levels are divided into various categories and all of them are available from
      the get-go, no need to unlock anything. no level numbers, sadly, and while a
      few puzzles might take a bit longer than others if you can''t immediately see
      what should go where, it''s basically [b]the same thing 200+ times without any
      kind of difficulty curve or variety[/b].


      simple but elegant presentation, I really liked the doodles after completing
      a level, but [b]audio is beyond annoying and repetitive[/b]. there are separate
      volume settings and a toggle for shadows (the light bulb icon, which isn''t
      for hints as I first thought), neither of which gets saved between sessions.
      volume settings will be where you left them, but after turning down both music
      and sound after a few minutes, I had to do it again every time I started the
      game. windowed mode is also available.


      it takes [b]about 4-5 hours[/b] to solve everything, I enjoyed it and it''s
      a good amount of content, you''ll probably have enough of tangrams for a while.
      not that there are many other options available on steam.'
