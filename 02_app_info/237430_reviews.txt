I devise a tactic that results in 2 of them being cut down before I engage. On the battlefield I somehow still face 8 enemies... If the devs fail at basic math, I'm not surprised the game has so many crashes. Like to alt-tab? Crashes. Like to load your saves? Crashes.\n\nIf you can look past all that, there's a somewhat enjoyable managing game hidden somewhere. The world-building is very good, with lots of interesting characters 'n camp-site banter.","timestamp_created":1609799299,"timestamp_updated":1609799299,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+/3g5/YCct/DwAI="}
