    review: "A very good game in this genre, doubly so considering it was made by\
      \ one man. \n\nFirst, speaking on the game itself on a technical level. The\
      \ environments are engaging and varied enough without overstaying their welcome.\
      \ The sound design is on the same level. The puzzles are in no way difficult\
      \ but they are quick and engaging enough to keep the pacing comfortable. The\
      \ game crashed for me twice in my playthrough but the autosaving is very generous\
      \ only putting me a few paces behind wherever the crash happened. \n\nThe pacing\
      \ was decent enough. I got stuck a few times mostly due to a lack of explicit\
      \ direction at times. I can imagine a player without a watchful eye will miss\
      \ pickups leading to a LOT of wandering around without really knowing what to\
      \ do. Just keep your eyes open and explore every nook and cranny. \n\nIn terms\
      \ of the design of the game, I rather liked the developer's approach. I don't\
      \ want to spoil anything. To put it simply, the few things I thought I was going\
      \ to complain about he either moved on from or fixed during the course of the\
      \ game. I don't know if this is just the \"I'm a solo dev and I got better as\
      \ I made the game\" or if it was intentional, but it worked out great. It really\
      \ helped enhance the feeling of uneasiness, which I would say is the point.\n\
      \nThe story hits hard the idea of being a stranger in your own home. Most of\
      \ the time you are technically safe but the idea of being in danger is nearly\
      \ constant. The few times you are in \"danger\" and get caught, you don't game\
      \ over, you just get shook. Exactly like being emotionally abused but having\
      \ no scars to prove it, no damage on the outside. \n\nMaybe the thread connecting\
      \ the \"game world\" to the abuse imagery is a little flimsy, that's up to the\
      \ player to decide. All I know is the feelings of having to go through that\
      \ as a kid were captured really well here. \n\nSorry you had to go through that\
      \ Adam, hang in there."
