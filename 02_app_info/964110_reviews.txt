I was hoping for a Final Fantasy VIII like card game. The drawn art is okay, but the gameplay is monotonous. When you win you get a choice of cards you can get, but they're usually all the same. The only way to get better cards is to upgrade them by combining them. To get a card fully levelled up, you need 8 cards (meaning repeating the same battle 8 times), but even then the upgrades are marginal. The game feels very unpolished and grindy. With some more love this game could be a lot more. It is entertaining for a while and for that reason worth its price tag, but there's no real depth in here.","timestamp_created":1557048500,"timestamp_updated":1557048500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8tPUw+oCeqTNwAE="}
