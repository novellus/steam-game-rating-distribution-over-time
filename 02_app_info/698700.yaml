      /><br><br>1587, 2A - 15 years have passed since the guns of the Great War at
      last fell silent. <br><br>The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation
      of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had
      acted on the world stage, only two remained; the kingdom of Cirinthia and the
      ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated
      Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering,
      and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart.<br><br>So did his people.<br><br>They
      supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed
      the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised
      an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too
      wearied by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit
      has proven<br>successful.<br><br>The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing
      its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at
      one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are

      /><br><br>Rise of the Third Power is a love letter to the glory days of the
      console style RPG, with modern conveniences such as auto-save, and a combination
      of the best elements of Japanese and western style gameplay and writing. Experience
      this fusion of east and west, old and new, in a game meant to surpass Stegosoft
      Games' previous work in every way!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>CUSTOM
      BATTLE SYSTEM</strong> - Rise of the Third Power offers 8 playable characters
      in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses,
      all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need
      for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique strengths and
      weaknesses, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge
      into battle.<br></li><li><strong>POLITICAL INTRIGUE</strong> - As the world
      of Rin is recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed,
      with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be
      both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks
      down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history...<br></li><li><strong>PERSISTENT
      EQUIPMENT</strong> - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a
      permanent and unique unlockable upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing
      replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet
      back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon... Each
      character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total!
      This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the
      completionist something useful to hunt for.<br></li><li><strong>STORY DRIVEN</strong>
      - Join a party of 8, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and
      personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor,
      Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they
      navigate the treacherous world of Rin.</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/698700/extras/fighthting.png?t=1572777728"
