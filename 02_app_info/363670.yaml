    about_the_game: Seeders is a puzzle-platformer with tight and responsive controls
      and some really challenging puzzles. If you share my opinion that most recent
      games in the genre have been too easy on the puzzles - then this game is for
      you. This game will make you stop and think. You will think about the puzzles
      when you are away from the computer. The puzzles don't have many moving parts,
      so it's easy to combine them in your head. But the solution is rarely obvious
      and usually isn't the first thing that comes to your mind. <br><br>The game
      engine allows you to experiment with the world and try different approaches
      until you find one that works. Some of the puzzles can be solved in multiple
      different ways. Checkpoints are abundant and it's always easy to go for one
      more try. In the first chapter there are subtle clues in the environment like
      billboards or signs on walls that should give you hints.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>single player adventure<br></li><li>local co-op with additional
      puzzles designed for two players<br></li><li>original soundtrack<br></li><li>support
      for various controllers<br></li><li>support for older graphics cards and computers<br></li><li>over
      100 unique puzzles including switches, sensors, doors, elevators, movable blocks,
      lasers, mirrors, driving vehicles, flying a spaceship, manipulating gravity
      and your enemies</li></ul><br>Players who want extra challenge can try to collect
      all the hats, which requires solving some optional difficult puzzles or solving
      the existing puzzles in different ways.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controller support</h2><br>Controllers
      are fully supported. Some standard ones like Xbox 360 controller work out of
      the box. All others can be configured within the game. <br><br>Single player
      game can be played with the keyboard or controller. Co-op requires at least
      one controller. Other multiplayer modes require 1-4 controllers, depending on
      number of players. Only one player can use the keyboard.
