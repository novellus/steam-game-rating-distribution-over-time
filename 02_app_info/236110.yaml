    review: "I loved the first Dungeon Defenders. I'm not kidding, I played for hundreds\
      \ of hours with my friends. Unfortunately, this game does little to improve\
      \ upon that first game with the added kick in the teeth of a ton of micro-transactions.\
      \ \n\nI bought this back when it was first released with a price tag so I was\
      \ expecting gameplay that reflected that. Unfortunately, after the beta release,\
      \ they went the way of mobile games and locked characters and outfits behind\
      \ micro-transations instead of beating a map like they had in previous games.\
      \ Thoroughly disappointed. Honestly, just go back and stick with the first game\
      \ and skip this version."
