No need to grind, could probably skip a lot of fights if you want as enemies are on the map. Choice of party composition. English translation is \"not good\" but it's extremely good actually and adds to the entertainment value. Beat it in 4 hours... but there seems to be more to do on an alternate path!","timestamp_created":1591718877,"timestamp_updated":1591718877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535452306270599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49NL1zPICctOMjQI="}
