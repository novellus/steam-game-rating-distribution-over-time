    review: "From the very beginning i knew what awaits me and i was well prepared\
      \ for the heart attack episodes! \nI turned on the game and the starting menu\
      \ background seemed dark and grim! It didn't took too long to make me feel nervousness.\
      \ Everything that is related to Japanese legends and their spiritual world,\
      \ they always transmitted to me that feeling of negativity. \nBizarre atmosphere,\
      \ grotesque demons lurking and waiting, eerily echoes of pure evilness....\n\
      This one is similar to Onryo gaming style. Has to do with the urban legend of\
      \ Hanako-san, including some other Y\u014Dkai demons!\nEstimated time to complete:\
      \ unknown hahaha!\nIt depends! If you want to wander endlessly to the long hallways,\
      \ looking for keys (and there's a lot many keys and rooms) and important objects\
      \ inside the class rooms, without knowing what may come after you in every dark\
      \ corner and run with panic later...fine by me! \nFor me that plan didn't stand\
      \ a chance! My plan B was to watch a walkthrough guide! \nI still kept running\
      \ with panic but at least i knew where to run lol. Hanako gave me some real\
      \ scares. I was crouch walking during the whole game hahaha! \nAnd still two\
      \ different endings waiting for me to enter their terror...\nOnce again Chilla's\
      \ Art team hold the lead in Japanese horror!\n10/10!!!\n\nLights off! And wear\
      \ headphones!\n"
