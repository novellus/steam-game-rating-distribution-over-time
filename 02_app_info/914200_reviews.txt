I've been playing a ton of football managers starting football manager 87 ,and this one is cute.I understand the other negative reviews ,and the editor has some lacks,and also the match engine it's not so updated, but for me ,i can dig it.(maybe in future installments we will see implementations the users suggested ideas).Only one manager came very close to what every player wants ,and it's on steam,but i won't reveal its name.Hope to see future titles from this game","timestamp_created":1601298657,"timestamp_updated":1601298845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41Km26vQCf//PpAI="}
