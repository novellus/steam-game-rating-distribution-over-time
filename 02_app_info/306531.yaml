    review: 'This module is good, but have some problems.

      Almost entire book compiled into one(!) big page of reference manual.

      Very long page. You almost can''t find where you stopped reading last time.

      But when GMing, you can use NPCs from NPC sidebar button, so module is playable.

      Anyway, some my friends do not buying this product only because they like to
      read good converted reference.

      Sadly, this reference manual looking great, but not separated into useful pages.'
