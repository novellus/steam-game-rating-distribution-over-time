I'd say that the genre is very simple (I even forgot that this kind of games existed as I played games like this around 10 years ago) but in this game every level feels unique. There's story mode with 3 stages for each girl and if You want it You can install optional free patch that adds nudity. There's also arcade mode with global scoreboard which is kinda mid-level difficulty to get top score in because of the score multipliers being bigger with difficulty increased. I've got 4th place playing every level on hard but I kept dying on one level so I gave up. The art style is nice and gameplay is satisfying as long as You don't grind arcade mode for top scores and keep dying in the same level. Difficulty changes include changes to player/enemy movement speed, negative bonuses from boxes and scores multipliers (x1, x2, x4). If You're aiming for good score the game can be really hard with each level unique mobs movement and attack patterns. Here's an example of one of the unique bosses [spoiler] in one level there's a guy yelling to his father to stop downloading while he's playing and the game keeps freezing every few seconds saying \"waiting for other players\" [/spoiler] Girls and bosses have voice acting which is really nice. Overall I recommend buying it on a sale as the story mode is 1-2 hours and not everyone's gonna grind arcade mode for score. I think I spent too much time doing it as I kept dying many times which resulted in 8 hours of total gameplay until I finally decided to just play it on easy to get the achievements and finish the game.","timestamp_created":1609569589,"timestamp_updated":1609569589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48Nr04PYCdvHRvwI="}
