    review: "Californium is a part of the walking simulator genre. The only difference\
      \ between \"Dear Esther\"'s gameplay and Californium's gameplay are the puzzles\
      \ which are \"search and click\"-alike.\nThe graphics are simple but the developers\
      \ used their possibilities nicely to create 4 unique worlds with different looks\
      \ and different feelings in graphics, music, sounds, story and characters. \n\
      The characters are plain but not because the devs weren't able to create 3D\
      \ models but there is a little story twist in it. A story twist which is also\
      \ hard to understand if you never heard of Philip K. D\u0130ck and his novels\
      \ (in this case \"Man in the High Castle\"). \nSpeaking of Phil K. D\u0130ck:\
      \ Many players won't understand many hints and plot parts if they never heard\
      \ of this author, his stories and his life. Only the last chapter will give\
      \ some hints and explenations. But many things will keep being a riddle for\
      \ players who don't know anything about Phil. \nBut nonetheless this game got\
      \ a unique atmosphere and is also a nice play for any players who aren't interested\
      \ so much in reading 60's sci-fi stories by californian novel authors but in\
      \ dystopian scifi in general :)"
