    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Year 2 Pass</strong></h2>BlueGlow has
      officially wrapped up Year 1. The games first year helped shape it into what
      it is now, many free updates and content drops came that changed the game. Year
      1 started off with a handful of new maps in the first few months and as the
      months progressed, new game modes were added. <i>Ground War</i> and the <i>Operations</i>
      mode came with some of the largest content drops since launch. After those,
      many free updates including the <i>Graphics Update</i> dropped. Year 2 has now
      begun and is dropping with the free <i>Year 2 Pass</i>. All players will have
      immediate access to both the <i>Year 1 Pass</i> alongside the new <i>Year 2
      Pass</i>, containing all post launch content. Year 2 launches with a new free
      <i>Operation</i>, follow the <i>Death Road</i> leading into the military base
      and prepare for the next Operation. <i>Year 2</i> will bring more content than
      ever as we continue developing this game.
