    review: "The story is very basic. The paths are simple and follow your stats of\
      \ might magic stealth and speech to put it simply. Aside from being incredibly\
      \ simple with no plot twist or weighty decisions it also overly masculinizes\
      \ women, while minor compared to the problem of it being incredibly basic it's\
      \ a poor choice that takes away rather than adds quality to the story. \n\n\
      If you just want something to pass the time with this may be a purchase for\
      \ you, but if you have limited time and are looking for a good adventure I'd\
      \ pass on this one."
