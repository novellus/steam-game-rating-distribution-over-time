    review: "I have to say that I thought this was an ugly bird that I\u2019d never\
      \ want to fly, but after buying it and flying around several hours, I\u2019\
      ve come to really like this little plane. The W10 version is indeed speedy for\
      \ a high wing single engine. It handles really nicely, and is a great local\
      \ sightseer type. There are dozens of liveries between the W8 and W10 versions\
      \ as well as many different seat colors. Nothing flashy, but a darn good plane\
      \ for short trips at low altitudes. \nThe GPS and auto pilot work great and\
      \ I like that the window obstructing struts can be removed by the flick of a\
      \ switch. \nThe tail dragging variants are tougher to take and line up from\
      \ the cockpit view, but it\u2019s not much of an issue if you switch to an external\
      \ cam."
