    review: '(Foreword:  You may ignore my playtime;  I played the crap out of this
      upon original release.  Now I''m just having a bit of fun running around the
      world.)


      Altered Destiny is an adventure game where the player controls the character
      with the arrow keys and types commands with the keyboard.


      There are two specific issues I want to address with this review, which could
      affect your decision to purchase Altered Destiny:


      1.  This is the inferior MS-DOS version, and not the Amiga version, which has
      significantly better graphics.  I realise there used to be some commercial rights
      issues with running Amiga games via emulators.  However, Amiga Forever provides
      a solution for selling Amiga games on PC running through emulators.  Publishers
      like this one should look into it.


      2.  This game has one of the worst parsers ever.  (The parser being the typing
      interface.)  The vocabulary for general purpose English words is tiny, even
      as it contains many strange sci-fi terms inherent to the game world.  Many of
      these might not even occur to the player to enter.  (Make notes!!)  Because
      of the limitations of the parser, completing the game may very well prove impossible,
      even for very experienced adventurers (like myself *sigh*).


      Even considering the above two points of contention, I''m still going to recommend
      adventure fans pick up Altered Destiny.  The world building is fantastic.  And
      it''s a shame Accolade never released a sequel.
