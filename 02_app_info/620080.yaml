    review: "I found this game in my \"Recommended\" and, being intrigued by the unique\
      \ storyline (for a VN) I decided to give it a shot. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised\
      \ by this one. I really enjoyed the way that they handled the \"magical investigations\"\
      \ and the dynamics of the school as well.  On the whole, the group has fun dialogue\
      \ and good chemistry. I also think that they did a good job unfolding parts\
      \ of the underlying mystery and the MC's backstory within each route, making\
      \ all of them worth playing. \n\nSpeaking of the MC, this is a rare VN main\
      \ guy who is neither annoyingly weak and spineless, nor aggravatingly juvenile,\
      \ pervy and cringey to the point of being unlikeable.   He's got his issues,\
      \ but he's also a competent and decent guy. Not only did I root for him, but\
      \ I also found myself genuinely wanting to know what his deal was (yes, I'm\
      \ being purposely really vague).\n\nAs far as issues go, there were just a few\
      \ noticeable hiccups with the translation. On a couple of occasions, the text\
      \ didn't wrap properly and/or the font got wonky in the middle of a sentence,\
      \ causing things to shift around in a slightly confusing way. There was also\
      \ at least one text box that wasn't translated at all, so that bit of dialogue/description\
      \ was entirely missed. Additionally, it doesn't record playtime accurately.\
      \ I spent MUCH longer than 6.8 hours playing this game so that makes it difficult\
      \ to say just how long it took me to finish. (I played this quite some time\
      \ ago, so I am unsure if these problems have been fixed or not.)\n\nOther than\
      \ those issues, I don't recall having any major problems with game.   In my\
      \ opinion, it's a good visual novel and I wish that more people would play it.\
      \ Not only would they hopefully have fun, but maybe then Sekai would stop dragging\
      \ their feet and finish localizing the other two entries in the trilogy. I am\
      \ itching to find out what happens next!"
