    about_the_game: "Poly Island is a low poly adventure game packed with beautiful\
      \ graphics, simple mechanics and challenging levels. <br />\r\nIt's in 3D with\
      \ a customizable camera, and the goal of the game is to dodge various obstacles,\
      \ that are trying to prevent you to reach the end of each level. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nThe game features 50 levels, that gradually become more challenging,\
      \ and it introduces the player with new obstacles to overcome.<br />\r\nThere\
      \ are also 3 distinctive game modes for players who finish the game so that\
      \ they can enhance the experience further.<br />\r\nEach of the levels has its\
      \ own unique timed challenge which you will have to beat. It forces the player\
      \ to think out of the box and find a way to finish the level in time.<br />\r\
      \nMax lives- you start with just 3 lives, it may seem easy at the start, but\
      \ later on, the levels get more and more challenging because if you die 3 times,\
      \ the level restarts back to the beginning!  Good luck \U0001F642<br />\r\n\
      No checkpoint- last but not least, our favorite is the no checkpoint mode. The\
      \ name is kinda self explanatory. There are no checkpoints. You will have to\
      \ survive, dodge and finish the entire level in time.<br />\r\nOther fun stuff\
      \ to share: The game is fully controller supported, meaning that you can play\
      \ it with your mouse, controller or a keyboard. We noticed that playing with\
      \ different choices also changes the game experience a lot,<br />\r\nso make\
      \ sure that you try out each one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo waste no time, dive\
      \ in our beautiful and low poly island and show us that you can dodge bullets,\
      \ spikes, crushers, lasers and other obstacles that we had planned for you."

    review: 'Relaxing paradise for hard working casual gamers, I guess (harder modes
      are available, though). One of the most calming games I ever played (I mean
      that in a positive sense).


      The sterile factory-style is without character. I would have preferred very
      much a "Dark Dungeon of Doom", with shuffling ghouls and skeleton archers shooting
      at you, while you''re avoiding shredding traps.


      Why is the protagonist a cube that turns into a marble while moving? Why not
      being a marble to begin with? Oh well, some might interpret that as a form of
      art. I would have preferred very much a scantily clad amazon.'
