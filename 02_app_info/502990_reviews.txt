Ever.\n\nThe translation is atrocious, there are rampant errors in the script, there's very little use of visuals to aid the writing, there are no choices to be made, and the music is primitive.\n\nThe fact that the game is glitched and sticks you in an infinite loop where you can't advance is actually a blessing. Even though this is an indie game created on a small budget, it's still inexcusably bad.","timestamp_created":1476670381,"timestamp_updated":1476670381,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.712962210178375244","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vLua6NcCfuq+Yw=="}
