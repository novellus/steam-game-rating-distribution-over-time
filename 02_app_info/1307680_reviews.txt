I am a HUGE Ark Survival Evolved fan, but I Love to build in Ark, and that's what caught my eye in this game, HOWEVER, I have only played a tad bit in Sparks of the future (city area) or whatever it is called, and I am AMAZED, STUNNED, the graphics, the transit system, everything is functional..... I HIGHLY recommend this game to people who love space, building, and exploration games...I will write another review probably a month or so into playing it to give more ideas on what I liked disliked, but I was super amazed at things already I had to do a quick comment review of the game... it's THAT impressive !","timestamp_created":1609723239,"timestamp_updated":1609723239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4peu+5fYCfcWgwAI="}
