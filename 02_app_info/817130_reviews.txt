Otherwise, just plug in a controller and it's a great 8/10 game. Particularly the character creator, you can pretty much make anything as long as it isn't hideously deformed in a way that defies science TOO much, then watch your beautiful hideous creations settle their differences in the ring.","timestamp_created":1610062869,"timestamp_updated":1610062869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oLbO7/YCeIu0wQI="}
