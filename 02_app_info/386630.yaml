    about_the_game: "Nirvana was a company specialized in gravity research. At first,\
      \ all they had was a spinning room, and the desire to, one day, be able to manipulate\
      \ space-time, and therefore, gravity itself. Then came the day: they finally\
      \ made it! All the equations were right, and that led the Nirvana Facility to\
      \ prosperous times... for around two hours. Gravity could do so much more than\
      \ deform space time, so much more... and they found it in a &quot;not so good&quot;\
      \ way. They ended up colliding their dimension with someone else's, opening\
      \ a very unexpected gateway. What, or who, did they find in the other side?<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe puzzles on this game usually present you with a situation,\
      \ with no obvious way out. You must use all the resources at you disposal to\
      \ proceed, and keep moving foward. You play as Tom Walker, a security guard\
      \ that wakes up in an empty room inside the Nirvana Facility soon after an emergency\
      \ evacuation. Right at the beginning, you meet the familiar voice of Doctor\
      \ Lestrade, the man to instruct you through the various puzzles the facility\
      \ presents. The puzzles involve interesting gravity shifts, and a gun that can\
      \ move heavy objects, create anti-gravitational spheres and teleport Walker\
      \ around."

      A Portal-like with a glaringly obvious lack of polish.  I only did the first
      few puzzles, but they were [i]bad[/i].  The voice acting is nearly incomprehensible,
      and there''s no way to disable mouse acceleration.  There are literally dozens
      of similar games out there that are better - avoid this one.'
