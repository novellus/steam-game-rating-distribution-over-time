      /><br>When Sorbetta loses almost everything in a game of Blackjack, she realizes
      she has a serious gambling problem. Thankfully she was able to get help for
      her gambling addiction and also borrow what she needed to pay off her debts
      from her cousin. However, was this loan divine providence, or a deal with the
      devil? Join Sorbetta as she tries to not only earn the money (plus interest)
      to pay back her cousin, but also find four fantastical treasures that will ensure
      Sorbetta is never bothered by Sherberta again.<br><br>It's not as if the treasures
      are just garbage, and Sorbetta is probably wasting her time, right?<br><br>...<strong><i>Right?!</i></strong><br><br><img

      chance to profit off her cousin's little...problem. Even though she can be quite
      demanding and even a bit bullish, there does beat a heart of gold somewhere

    review: 'For disclosure''s sake, I''m a friend of the dev, who''s done some work
      for them.


      A short and simple RPG Maker game (which doesn''t actually contain adult content
      aside from some comedic book excerpts, despite the tag).


      PROS:

      - Easy to get 100% achievements, with a free guide also available

      - Writing is its strong point, has some cute and funny moments

      - Hilarious game development backstory, created during a series of Twich streams
      on a challenge

      - Good for casual play. Doesn''t require any significant grinding or farming.


      CONS:

      - Mostly default assets. A lot of non-default assets tend to be lacking.

      - Relies a lot on community in-jokes and references

      - Created during a series of Twitch streams. Stream chat had [i]a lot[/i] of
      input.

      - Too simple to have really fulfilling gameplay if you''re looking for something
      with more meat to it.'
