    short_description: A game where you control a fleet-scale airship and fight enemy
      flying battleships. I think it's more like a simulation or a strategy than an
      action.

    review: "Neat little game but completly bare bones think of this as a glorified\
      \ demo. \nSo if you are not a hardcore naval and ship combat nut like me I don't\
      \ recommend you spending your cash yet.\n\nBut hey if you do buy this five buck\
      \ game then good for you! You're helping a person to finish their game."
