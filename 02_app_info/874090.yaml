    about_the_game: 'Living With Jaguars is an interactive virtual reality film documenting
      wild jaguars in Brazil. Part documentary and part immersive game, Living With
      Jaguars explores historical and current tensions in a rural region where jaguars
      prey on ranchers'' cattle and ranchers kill them in retaliation. Now, ranchers
      and jaguars must find new ways to co-exist - or risk the future of a species
      under threat. In this film, users explore the complex and interconnected perspectives
      of four key stakeholders: jaguars, ranchers, conservation researchers, and ecotourism
      operators. Each is vying to protect their destiny in one of the harshest and
      most unforgiving regions of the world.'

    review: Although rough around the edges, this little interactive documentary has
      plenty of great details on Panthera's work to maintain Jaguars in Brazil.  There
      are a few interactive props and a neat overhead map of the ranch compound.  Some
      of the 360 video clips are very low resolution and may cause mild discomfort
      in VR.  A nascent yet inexpensive look at potential uses of VR for learning
      purposes.
