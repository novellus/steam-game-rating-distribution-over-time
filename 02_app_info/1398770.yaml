    review: 'Not only artbook, but it also tell us the development of Spiritfarer
      and most importantly background of each character and a bit about world of Spiritfarer.
      It helps me clear some confusion about few character story and world of Spiritfarer.


      I hope there will be physical edition of this artbook.'
