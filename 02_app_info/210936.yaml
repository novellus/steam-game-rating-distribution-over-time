      <strong>The Chickenator </strong>- part dead policeman, part robot and all foul.
      This one is special, in so many ways. Not the least of those is the fact that
      his robot eye glows in the dark and his chicken suit tends to leave a trail
      of feathers behind it, just so you know where he''s been!</p>


      <h2>Key features:</h2>


      <p>Special Inspector Edmund Cook made quite a name for himself carving a chunk
      out of the Horzine creatures spat forth during the outbreak.  But every warrior,
      even one dressed as farm poultry, must eventually taste the harsh sting of ultimate
      defeat. Happily, a mysterious benefactor possessed the means to resurrect our
      deranged copper and return him (and his infamous costume) to the fray.  Enhanced
      with combat biotech designed to dish out some serious assault and battery to
      Horzine''s minions, despite technically being dead, Cook''s legend continues
      to grow. He is out there. He can''t be bargained with. He can''t be reasoned
      with. He doesn''t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And he absolutely will not
      stop, ever.</p>'
