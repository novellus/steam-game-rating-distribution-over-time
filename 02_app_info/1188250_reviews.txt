One of the best elements of this game is the enemy design variation: each enemy seems unique and hard to predict. You never really know what's going to slowly lumber towards you or lunge at you. The game keeps you on your feet. The graphics are also really well done and the sound design is superb. They nail the atmosphere in this game. However, this game does have a lot of issues it needs to fix before it comes anywhere near a full release: \n\nA lot of times it seemed like it would just throw hordes and hordes of enemies at you. I felt like the more fun moments of the game were moments like monsters breaking out of the wall and not knowing where they were going to come from. I think the game would benefit from more well-thought out and linear level design akin to Half-Life or Doom 3 than to just depend on throwing hordes of enemies at you. Also, the sound design is great, but some of the audio cues don't blend together well. You can very clearly hear when the ambiance loops and it's a bit jarring. Some game elements also aren't really well explained, like the EMP Wave or Time Distorion, which I assume are weapon mods but you are never explained what they are or are ever taught how to use them. Things like medpacks and adrenaline could also benefit from a quick key if there isn't one already, because as far as I know to use one you have to pause the game to use it. \n\nOverall though, I think with continued effort, this is going to shape up to be a very solid game. I love that the game uses Unreal and sounds from freesounds.org showing that anyone can make a game, you just have to put time and effort in. And I can definitely see this had a lot of time and effort put into it. Looking forward to full release.","timestamp_created":1609534866,"timestamp_updated":1609534866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpaDw3/YCcNrBvwI="}
