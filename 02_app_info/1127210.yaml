    review: 'The visual novel "Mystery at Stonyford Bridge" is a well-written, emotional
      conspiracy / teen detective story with a focus on friendship and human relations.
      You play as Grey, who returns from his first university term to celebrate Christmas
      with his family and friends in a small, peaceful town where nothing bad ever
      happens. Two days later he learns that his closest friend, a girl with a cheerful
      and optimistic personality, has apparently committed suicide. Grey and his friends
      have doubts and investigate on their own, which gradually spins out of control.


      I found the plot very interesting. There is constant suspense and mystery due
      to two conflicting notions - one is the suspicion about a conspiracy to cover
      something up, and the other is that Grey might just be going crazy. There is
      clear evidence that there isn''t everything right with Grey, but there are also
      many indicators that there is indeed something odd going on in this town. I
      developed several theories during my playthrough, but still got surprised by
      how everything fit together in the end.


      The game''s biggest strength is its writing. While I (sadly) find most visual
      novels rather boring due to broken English, vapid writing, unimaginative stories,
      and lack of choice, this one really shines. The writer shows excellent command
      of English, the dialogue (especially between the friends) flows naturally, and
      the tone is skillfully changed between thoughtful, sad, humorous, suspenseful,
      and emotional. The characters have (mostly) believable feelings, motivations,
      and depth.


      Several of the more emotional scenes affected me quite deeply, which I mean
      as a compliment to the writer. Unfortunately though, I can''t really talk about
      the details without spoiling parts of the plot. On the flipside, in some moments
      the plot progression felt a little forced, and the game''s two main premises
      could be seen as not very realistic. But personally I didn''t have any problems
      to suspend my disbelief - some parts of the story felt a bit far-fetched, but
      they do form a coherent whole.


      There aren''t many choices in the game - I haven''t counted, but there may be
      about 12 scenes where you have to decide between up to 3 mutually exclusive
      options in each. The choices felt meaningful to me, but after only one playthrough,
      I can''t say for sure.  The game also gives you several "fake choices", i.e.
      scenes where your choice does not seem to matter, or where you can use all the
      options consecutively. Additionally, the game gives you a few "investigative"
      scenes, where you point-and-click on various interactive objects until you find
      the one that progresses the story. Those I found rather weak since they don''t
      require any thought - you just move the mouse around and click on everything
      that lights up, until the story continues.


      There is a nifty "undo" function that can take you several scenes back if you
      regret a choice you made, and you have 8 save slots available, which helps to
      explore different outcomes.


      The game''s graphics look a bit amateurish, but not bad. I really appreciate
      when a visual novel depicts people as, well, people instead of grossly disfigured
      creatures bound to collapse under the weight of their mammaries. I didn''t like
      the oversized eyes of several characters, but at least they have noses, which
      is more than many other visual novels care to deliver.


      All things considered, I think Mystery at Stonyford Bridge is a captivating,
      serious, well-written story that deserves much more attention than it is currently
      getting. Unfortunately it''s hard to explain why I liked it so much without
      spoiling important parts of the plot, but I do recommend it to people who like
      stories about the human condition in relatable settings. At the time of this
      writing it''s on sale for just $1 - at that price, if anything of what I said
      appeals to you, there''s really no reason not to give it a shot. ;)'
