The developer redid the game completely! It is practically another game!\nThis new build is completely improved. I think he felt that the initial result was unsatisfactory. So he decided to start again in a gesture of respect for the user. Congratulations on the demonstration of professionalism.\n\nI'll be honest: I didn't like the first version. :-| (Boring...)\nNow, what I played was worth the investment. Of course, we are not talking about an AAA game. I loved it!\nI liked this update! It has action, a compelling story and a very fun dynamic. :-)\nTry playing!\nGameplay ★★★★ Graphic ★★★★★ Plot ★★★ Performance ★★ (Depending on the GPU: ★ )","timestamp_created":1606876905,"timestamp_updated":1608649528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrPq+xfYCfP/TtgI="}
