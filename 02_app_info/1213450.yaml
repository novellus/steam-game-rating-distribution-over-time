    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Craftica: A Next-Generation Creative Sandbox
      Game with Subvoxels</h2><br>Craftica is a next-generation creative sandbox game
      with a near-infinite open world composed of only procedurally generated subvoxel
      terrain and objects. It is an indie game partially inspired by Minecraft, but
      taking the voxel representation to the next level with multiscale subvoxels.
      Craftica currently supports both creative and survival modes with a main focus
      on the creative mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Voxel and Subvoxels</h2><br>In Craftica
      the basic voxel is a full cube and the subvoxels are partial cubes with one
      or more corner chopped off.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Voxel_and_Subvoxels.png?t=1587781386"
      /><br><br>The support of subvoxels in Craftica make it possible to use relatively
      smooth representations of objects in the game. Also the voxel and subvoxels
      in Craftica are supported at multiple size levels, so that fine structures can
      be represented at a scale comparable to the real world.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Wooden_Objects.png?t=1587781386"
      /><br><br>As an example,  Craftica has very good support for Chinese architectures,
      and includes a large number of standard structures with Chinese architecture
      styles.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Chinese_Structures.png?t=1587781386"
      /><br>In fact, these structures and every other models in Craftica are generated
      programmatically in the game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Smart Placement of Blocks and
      Items</h2><br>Craftica is designed to allow intuitive construction of objects
      using subvoxels, and supports consistent operations for placing basic blocks
      (voxels and subvoxels) and items.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Preview_Add_Block.gif?t=1587781386"
      /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Preview_Add_Item.gif?t=1587781386"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">In-Scene Crafting</h2><br>Item crafting in Craftica can
      be done in the scene, using formulas that are structural and intuitive.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Crafting_Axe.gif?t=1587781386"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Village</h2><br>In Craftica worlds, some places are generated
      with villages. Each village is generated with a few houses and at least one
      workshop and one defensive fort or tower, and spawns with at least one warrior
      to defend the village.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Village_Structures.png?t=1587781386"
      /><br><br>The relationship between a village and a player is characterized by
      affinity. Affinity can be zero, positive or negative, indicating a neutral,
      friendly or hostile relationship.<br><br>The affinities between villages and
      player(s) are initialized randomly. Normally, there will be more neutral villages
      than friendly and hostile ones, and more friendly ones than hostile ones. Their
      actual percentages may vary according to game modes and difficulty levels.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Trade</h2><br>When a positive affinity reaches certain levels,
      the player will have free access to some village structures and storages (different
      structures and storages may have different affinity thresholds). And when a
      negative affinity reaches a certain level, the village warrior will actively
      attack the player.<br><br>Trading with villagers or defending the village against
      hostile mobs will improve the affinity between the player and the village. On
      the other hand, attacking villagers will deteriorate the affinity.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Trading.gif?t=1587781386"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Survival</h2><br>In survival mode, barbarians and other
      hostile mobs will be generated. They will attack the player and villages. The
      only way to survive is to fight back or run!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Attacking_Barbarian.gif?t=1587781386"

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Instant Help and Hint</h2><br>Craftica can provide instant
      help and hint that is relevant to the current state of the game and the player.
      Such help and hint can be turned on or off with the H key at any time. Instant
      help and hint is automatically turned on when a new world is started, unless
      it is disabled in the game options.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1213450/extras/Instant_Help.gif?t=1587781386"
