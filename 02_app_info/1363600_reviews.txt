I think I kinda get the idea for how odd (and poorly translated) the game series can be. I'm not generally the kinda guy that gets caught up by easy jump scares, but as everyone knows VR adds the kinda depth that even basic things are more exciting. So with that in mind I gave momo.exe VR a shot (it's both games in one package) and I gotta say it's surprisingly scary being chased by momo through a maze. Though I did get a bit motion sick since the run speed is incredibly quick. So consider that before your purchase. \n\nIt's a 6/10 here's my gameplay, but you should know what it's like if you played the non-vr versions: https://youtu.be/UyMLBPlxG5Y","timestamp_created":1598389321,"timestamp_updated":1598389321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40q/bk/QCcODgnQI="}
