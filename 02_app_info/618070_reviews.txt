Incredibly fun shmup with lots of playable characters and great retro inspired music and visuals. The artstyle is really nice and the mechanics for scoring are really fun when you can chain up medals. There's a coin system that lets you accumulate continues, and every run lets you get points to spend to unlock characters and, with enough points, unlmited continues.\n\nI've played another STG game from these devs and feel like all of their stuff can be recommended for all shmup lovers.","timestamp_created":1604428057,"timestamp_updated":1604428057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqnXx/UCfeKLrAI="}
