    review: "If the rather sad song \"Cats In The Cradle\" became a game, this would\
      \ be that game. Whilst wandering home you find the abandoned home of a man who\
      \ had it all. Except the one thing he needed the most. Kind of brings you up\
      \ short and reminds you having it all isn't worth it if there is never any time\
      \ to enjoy it or those you love.\n\nEDIT: The true beauty of this game comes\
      \ from  reading the dairies and absorbing the story. Then wandering the beautiful\
      \ surroundings you know the man who lived there missed. There are lakes, ponds,\
      \ silken waterfalls and peaceful trails. There are pretty spots all around to\
      \ just relax in. \n\nTake in the view from the glass house, walk the trails\
      \ and visit the waterfalls. Wander all over the map and see what natural treasures\
      \ you find."
