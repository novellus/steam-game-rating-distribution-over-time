The world you explore feels very alien and mysterious, and really lets your imagination take over. Where the game and I butt heads though, is with the movement. It felt like I was constantly fighting the game for control of my character the whole way through, and it really kills the fun I was having taking in the environments. Maybe this is just a problem unique to me, but damn if it didn't sour my experience. Ultimately I just barely give this a recommended, but it's one of those games where, if someone asked if I liked it, I'd have to stop and think about it a bit first.\n\nFinal Rating: Hazy","timestamp_created":1597005771,"timestamp_updated":1597005771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j8a96vMCf6e8mgI="}
