    review: "I'm certain the creator of this game was inspired by the Canadian thriller,\
      \ \"Cubed.\" It's worth it to check it out just for that. I see a lot of reviews\
      \ here who have given it a thumbs down after less than hour. I should mention,\
      \ that even after playing this game for, at time of writing, 11 hours, I am\
      \ still pretty sure I haven't beaten the game. Yes, you can die very quickly,\
      \ but you can also restart very quickly.\n\nThis isn't the sort of game where\
      \ you can just play and beat it like Mario. This is game is a bit more like\
      \ Dark Souls, where you bash your head against a wall until the wall breaks.\
      \ This is the sort of game you need to play over and over in a vain attempt\
      \ to get a little further each time.\n\nI recommend watching \"Cubed\" before\
      \ you play the game. It adds to the experience.\n\nCan it be frustrating? Yes.\n\
      \n Do I still enjoy it? Definitely!"
