    about_the_game: "This pond ain't big enough for the both of us. Two toy boats\
      \ go in. Only one comes out. Can you time your cannon fire perfectly to defeat\
      \ your opponent?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Pond Wars two players sit down on a single\
      \ keyboard. Each player controls a boat, which they can move left and right\
      \ on a 2D screen. Each boat is equipped with a cannon that is used to fire shots\
      \ at the opponent ship. Hit your opponent's boat enough times, and their boat\
      \ will sink to the bottom of the pond, giving you the victory.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nSounds simple right? The trick is you can't aim your shots directly.\
      \ Each time a cannon ball hits the water, it will create waves. You have to\
      \ time your shot perfectly with the bouncing waves in order to hit your opponent.\
      \ As more cannon balls hit the water, the waves become bigger and bigger, allowing\
      \ for all sorts of mayhem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGames are quick matches that last\
      \ five or so minutes each. Of course if you win, your opponent is going to want\
      \ to get revenge in a rematch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote this game plays with\
      \ two players on one keyboard. No single player is available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Two player game play<br />\r\n- Configurable keyboard\
      \ controls<br />\r\n- Physics based wave system<br />\r\n- Fun and mayhem"
