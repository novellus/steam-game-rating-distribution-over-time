So you must judge different cases from execution to stalker.\nSounds interesting....now comes the downside. For judgement you have to interview 2 or 3 persons. Still intersting....only that the results of your judgement have little influence to the game.\nIn fact there are only a few cases with impact to the game. The other just drop or rise your fame, the peace or the economy..consequences? A few coins less for items you buy and\nthe items may on sale.\nThe world...you travel via waypoints on the worldmap. Each waypoint you must first visit and fight your way to the exit. After that you can skip it or visit it again for grinding.\nNow for fighting. Your party consist of up to 3 members. During your judgements some people join your crusade.\nYou can change them at any time. Even those not active gain exp...but not much.\nEvert person has one weapon *not changeable*  one armor and 2 support items. Also each member has 3 skills.\nYou can enchant the skill with up to 2 orbs. And if you chose the right skills in a fight you can get a chain combo at you next turn. The fights are usually not very demanding. Of course you level up....stats+ but not your skill points.\nAfter each level up you get full health and skill points.\nMoney....you will need it...lots of it. Because you must pay for updating your weapon. Each weapon can be updated 50 times....some new members comes with leveled up weapons.\n\nAnd finally you can get differnt endings...because of the few choices that matters.\nAfter that you can play the new game+ with the equipment and level of your characters.\nedit:\nok, I did it....played the game till every ending....and it was real boring.\nThe path is just a little different each time and you can fight some extra bosses.\nBut they are easy. Just use sleep and poisen and they don't even get a single hit on you.","timestamp_created":1583860907,"timestamp_updated":1584406903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jdeA8/ACdpej9wE="}
