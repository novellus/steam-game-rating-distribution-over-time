And just like games in an arcade hall, it makes you keep playing.\n\nWith the low price and simple game mechanics I did not expect this game would be fantastic, so it surprised me in a good way. It may not keep you playing for days or hours straight on end, but (at least for me) it makes me come back to play a few games every now and then. Especially with the developer still giving his/her project attention, which is much more than I expected. Both the game and dev deserve a bigger player base.\nThe controls and 'hitboxes' improved a lot since I bought the game. And especially after you get a little familiar with the game and levels this is less and less a problem (if it was one to begin with.) The game is pretty forgiving and levels are not crazy difficult either, so it is not an issue to me. What is even better; in recent months several improvements and even some new features were added to the game. And with Steam's recent new feature 'Remote Play Together' the (enjoyment) value of this game has increased even more!\n\nTops:\n+ Catches the retro arcade atmosphere perfectly\n+ Low price\n+ Addictive\n+ Developer still updates the game and replies to feedback\n+ Fast paced\n+ Levels are not too difficult (since it is a highscore oriented game, making levels too difficult would be questionable.)\n+ Perfect for (couch) Co-Op\n+ Music\n\nNeutral:\n- Only (local) couch Co-op, No Online Multiplayer (However, with Steam Remote Play, this should be no problem.)\n- Not much to do after you finish all levels/achievements, except for beating highscores. But that is one of the core goals in these game genres.\n- Controls can be a little confusing when first playing (the tutorial in the menu prevents this though.)\n\n\nDownsides (nitpicking):\n- There are some (very) rare glitches that can make you get pushed inside the top wall or get stuck in a level after you complete it (happened only once.)\n- In some rare cases you die while it looks like not hitting an enemy/deadly thing. \nNote: The cause for this last point might be too technical for me, but I assume bc of the retro pixel style and low resolution this is not totally avoidable. Also, this problem was worse when I bought this game, and the situation has improved significantly after updates. With the current difficulty of levels, it should not be a (big) issue.","timestamp_created":1591229035,"timestamp_updated":1591535211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n4K5x/ICdLyDjAI="}
