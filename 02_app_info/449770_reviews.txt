It has plenty of oddball humor and craziness as you attempt to find Justice and learn what has happened.  The fighting mechanics and abilities are inventive and keep the game from becoming just a slog of a typical  RPG grind. Unless you play in hard mode.  Hard mode is... a grindfest extraordinaire.  I would suggest sticking with Normal or Easy, as it has no bearing on the story.  \n\nInstead of typical enemies found in these style of games they are uniquely designed and use non stock art, which is a relief from so many RPGmaker games simply using base assets. Because the enemies aren't your typical RPG fare, you have to experiment as the usual kill x by using x doesn't apply, leading to less boring fights as you learn the game.   The stamina system is a nice system as well, I've not seen it used this way in very many games.  \n\nThe map is fun to explore and the art used different from anything else I've seen.  I never felt like I got too lost, nor did I feel it was far too big.\n\nAll in all it's well put together and well worth what is being asked for.  Well worth playing.  \n\nAs for why I have so little time in the steam version, I bought and originally finished the game on itchio.  \n\nThe only real con I have is that because it's RPGMaker and low budget,  the art though unique when not stock doesn't overcome the 'RPGmaker' feel.  Yet there is still enough changed in the game that it certainly isn't cookie cutter either.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1569013696,"timestamp_updated":1569013696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4KCgqO0CcJ/L0gE="}
