Such a vision that you don't typically see now a days.\n\nPros\n- The graphics are so intricate. The art really is something else. Like the little flowers sway on the ground and there are little elevators. \n- A little lunar lander is always fun. Good core gameplay.\n- Great Developer. This really is a work of art. Nice guy.\n\nCons\n- Be patient. There is a definite order of operations you must perform to get of the landing pad. Read the directions carefully.\n- You need good vision. My eyes not as good as they used to be. Really had to lean close to the monitor to see it.\n","timestamp_created":1573757466,"timestamp_updated":1573757466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.678124308586120605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2abQte4CdYGN2gE="}
