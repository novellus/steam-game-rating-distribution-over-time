This can get pretty annoying. This is why I have 3000 hours on record, because when my PC turns on, magic borderless usually turns on.\n\nFrom what I have read(I have never tried this) uninstalling the game can be a pain and requires more steps than just simply ya know, uninstalling it through steam.\n\n","timestamp_created":1608064713,"timestamp_updated":1608064713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4koiItPYCd63EugI="}
