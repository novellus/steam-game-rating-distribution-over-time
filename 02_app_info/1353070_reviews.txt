Gronions story is mysterious and surprisingly inclusive, constantly challenging you to explore, a game with a sense of responsability that invites you to protect life; controls work very well, graphics are impressive for an Indie game and It has so much action that it keeps you on the edge of excitement, I really enjoyed the first person mode.\n\nThe most surprising is the ease of getting on the flying ship, traveling, fighting against other spaceships and entering planets; combat music is very exciting and contrasts very well with a more subtle soundtrack when traveling through space, I was happy to see the new content recently released, and how often the game is updated, a nice touch is that water, trees, plants and even rocks have excellent interactivity.\n\nGronions really stands out from other games, highly recommended!","timestamp_created":1606477152,"timestamp_updated":1606477152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8P/fhPYCc8m7swI="}
