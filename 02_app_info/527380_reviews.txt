Each campaign is divided into sectors, and you must defeat each sector, which is one map. You control a small vessel and fly it in a side-on view. You can rotate and thrust your ship, and pick up and drop certain items. Your gun can fire in any direction, controlled by the mouse, and you have three secondary rockets or bombs. You have a mission, which varies each map: it might be to pick up a Marine APC from your ship and drop it in a certain location, or destroy three enemy targets, and so on. There are gun turrets which open and fire at you, pods that fire at you and are released from buildings, doors or shields that block progress, and sometimes you need to land on one platform to get a battery that you pick up and take to a socket. Nothing too complicated. As you complete each sector it brings you closer to completing the campaign. It also earns 'fleet resources', which you can use to automatically win a sector, or to build improved weapons or ships. These are lost when you die though (you have three lives in a mission).\n\nSo the gameplay is fairly simple and not very interesting, as are the graphics. Those in a sector are adequate, definitely looking like an earlier era, while the animated sequences, introducing the story, are just bad. Gameplay can be frustrating, since on harder missions you get swarmed by enemies, which cluster around you making it difficult to aim accurately or even move. Since they keep spawning from their silos it can be difficult to even reach the silos to destroy them.\n\nA lot of the achievements give you no idea what to do to achieve them, which is a major failing. Plus the bugs affect the achievements. I gained an achievement before I even started playing, and didn't get one for completing the Ceres campaign without failing a mission.\n\n[h1]The Bugs, the bugs[/h1]\nYou can fly through certain scenery. You can see an indicator of where your ship is, but you can't see which way it is facing, which is crucial. Unless you immediately spin the ship around and thrust back out, there is a good chance you will get stuck somewhere 'behind' the level, fruitlessly spinning and thrusting, trying to get the ship moving towards open space again.\n\nAnd the big one, the really big one is: you can't play the Mars campaign. You can start it certainly, but as soon as you try to start the first mission the game crashes back to the desktop. This is such an utterly obvious problem that I cannot see how the developer did not fix it. He isn't around any more to do anything about it.\n\n\nSo for these reasons, this is very much a [b]thumbs-down[/b] to the game.","timestamp_created":1584193621,"timestamp_updated":1584193681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496644318103790283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45qbT7PACd/SG+AE="}
