I don't know if it is the beginning, middle or the ending, but what I can say for sure is that not a single HOPA game I've played so far tackles with the basilik. An ancient creature; this being is said to be half rooster, half dragon. Just like a manticore; it is made of different body parts belonging to two up to four animals. Here, in this game, you must defeat two basiliks. As a cryptozoologist, you must put your knowledge at work in order to save the people of Serpent Hill. \n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful scenery;\n- Chilling music;\n- Three set of collectibles;\n- Main Game + Bonus Chapter + Secret Room (I've found this feature in the Haunted Hotel series);\n- Fast-traveling map;\n- Diverse HO games;\n- Intriguing mini-games (personally, I haven't seen these type of mini-games until now);\n- In-game achievements.\n\nNEUTRE:\n- I would have loved some plot twists; \n- I was constantly thinking that maybe this new sheriff might be one of them.\n\nCONS:\n- No journal entries;\n- No trading cards.\n\nOverall, a good game to play with your family.
