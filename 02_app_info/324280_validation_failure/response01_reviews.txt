Since the game launched around October 2014 there has been a single update which contained 1 freight train in a game that largely focuses on passenger transport\n\n- No support for Steam Workshop so its not even possible for modders to fix the above issues\n\nThe sad part is there is nothing actually wrong with the gameplay itself, its just that with the above mentioned problems I could not honestly recommend this game to anyone when there are other games like Train Fever that are doing it better.","timestamp_created":1429741659,"timestamp_updated":1470297455,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mdejqtYCeOWOOw=="}
