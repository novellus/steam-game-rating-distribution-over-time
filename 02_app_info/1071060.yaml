    review: 'Long time MegaMan fan here.

      This game makes me very happy!!

      I have long wished that Capcom would continue to make MegaMan games the way
      they used to back in the 80s and 90s. You know, with excellent music, attractive
      graphics, interesting bosses, normal gameplay... When I played MegaMan 11, I
      couldn''t find any of these things. It came out years ago and to this day I''m
      just left wondering where the appeal is...


      Kumacure has answered me on all of these things, it looks really cute and polished,
      it''s the kinda game that I just see 1 screenshot of it and Im already in love!
      Its music is good and catchy as heck! It''s a very small game, but fitting of
      the price. I see this as a game that should become a series, and it already
      is a favorite for me!!


      PLEASE!!


      I would LOVE sequels, I''d play 10 or more games like this!

      I''d pay more if the games were bigger!'
