CHANGE makes for a surprisingly addictive survival romp - and one that really left an impression. It's an inventive roguelike that's just as eye-openingly educational as it is enjoyable.”<br>80\/100 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.newgamenetwork.com\/article\/2302\/change-a-homeless-survival-experience-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >New Game Network<\/a><br><br>“Change is a gritty, hand-crafted, labor of love that transcends its simple, pixilated aesthetic.
