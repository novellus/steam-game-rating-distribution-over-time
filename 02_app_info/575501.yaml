    review: 'You aren''t going to find anything there that isn''t in the game. Actually,
      it''s even less, what you see on screenshots is what you get, not even a chart
      of combination of syllables with vowels that the game shows near the end. And
      it sure is uncomparable to what you can find on Internet for free.


      Don''t waste money, [strike]I should have said to myself back when I was worried
      over not owning all DLCs for games I have, ha![/strike]'
