This game is like the classic adventure HOAs where you have to work to find everything and figure things out.  There is no holding hands here. There is a great variety of puzzles of different types. Many of them were easy to figure out....others a bit of a challenge. I have enjoyed the story line. The voice acting is a bit rough around the edges. The music score it good, unobtrusive. There is a map for fast travel but no sparkles or indicators to let you know where to complete tasks, which suits me just fine. The hint recharges fast but doesn't always point clearly what to do...but that's a good thing because it makes you have to figure some things out on your own. Though I have only completed the whole game and the bonus chapter.\nMake sure to save your game too\n\nThe  story is intriguing. The graphics are awesome. Make sure to keep an eye for the coins. They are used to upgrade your palace and give you a quest for each map chapter area. You can complete the palace chapter quest before you leave each chapter or there's an option to skip. The coins are located throughout the game, even in the HOs. Morphing items are the same as the coins. Scattered through out the game. I found completing the HOs give you some coins.  By completing the palace quests you get items and come coins.  These  items are used to assist in the game.\n\nI recommend this game. Thank you, Devs, for addressing the bugs issues.","timestamp_created":1608880069,"timestamp_updated":1609534441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550561785697937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44tDu3/YCc6b9vAI="}
