Great level design with lots of different challenges. Levels feel very polished and tested.\nMovement gets really good at mid game and you'll be able to move with sharp precision.\n \nThere's a lot of ways to customise the game so you can make it very easy or brutally hard.\n\nThe last part was tough, my hands hurt and now I'm scared of trying the masochist mode (1 heart and 1 checkpoint). Took me 6 hours to beat it the first time (with 2 hearts and 2 checkpoints) and I died A LOT of times.\n\nI'm not into precision platformers but decided to try the game for the exploration and abilities progression. I really enjoyed it and hope there's a sequel.","timestamp_created":1606796984,"timestamp_updated":1606797003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j5GkjvYCfLqbtgI="}
