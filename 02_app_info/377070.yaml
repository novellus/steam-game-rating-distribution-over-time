    review: "[b] TROPE IS A NINE LETTER WORD [/b]\n\nNostalgia. That, for me, is the\
      \ operative word when talking about the 90s. I lived my adolescence in that\
      \ period and, amongst a plethora of cultural landmarks, computer games such\
      \ as Noctropolis had a strong impact in how I saw and experienced gaming in\
      \ general.\n\nJust going back to those times, with this excellent Steam version,\
      \ was worth the price of admission. If we factor in the art direction of Shaun\
      \ Mitchell and the work of Owen Richardson on background art (Noctropolis\u2019\
      \ strongest suit), well, then this title truly shines as a gem from the past.\
      \ Not only that, but from costume design to the art of the graphic novel, this\
      \ game visual style is a true representative of what 90s gaming did well. A\
      \ quick nod to Ron Saltmarsh\u2019s musical score is also in order.\n\nOn the\
      \ other hand, since this is a review and not a memoir, we must try and go beyond\
      \ the effects of nostalgia and call a spade a spade. The downside of Noctropolis\
      \ lies with the writing, from the dialogues and character motivations all the\
      \ way up to story flow and plot twists. Not only does it come off as excessively\
      \ cheesy and juvenile, but also bland and sometimes even borderline insulting\
      \ to one\u2019s intelligence.\n\nEven giving a lot of leeway to the superhero\
      \ genre, Noctropolis reminded me of all the things 90s gaming did wrong. It\
      \ felt like watching an old photo album of oneself, cringing and laughing as\
      \ you flip through it.\n\nFun fact, though: the writing is not bad per se. It\
      \ may sound strange but clicking through all screens to find the descriptive\
      \ texts of items, locations and characters, is actually quite a treat. The prose\
      \ is stylish, and with great sense of humor. It just falls flat when applied\
      \ to the other areas I mentioned above.\n\nIn the end, as with most of the adventure\
