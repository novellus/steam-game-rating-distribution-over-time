      expandable card game with a rich story and intuitive mechanics played on an
      ever-changing planetary map. Compete head-to-head against other players as you
      move your armada, defend your homeland, and partake in strategic tactical battles.
      Master your strategy by researching new cards, scouting your enemies, and outwitting
      your opponents.<br><br><img src="https://media.st.dl.pinyuncloud.com/steam/apps/970370/extras/Img1.png?t=1580279384"

      on the galaxy map, they transform into 3D models of ships or structures that
      you can move around from planet to planet. Turns happen simultaneously, so you
      will need to anticipate, bluff, and out-think your opponent during each turn
      if you want to win. Your strategy relies on the deck you build and your choice
      of technology options selected before you play. During the game, you can modify
      your strategy by adding powerful, new cards to your deck from your tech-pool.  Explore
      worlds, colonize sectors, and gain resources to expand your galactic empire
      and conquer your enemies.

      \ decks with a huge variety of strategies and depth</strong> Build your deck\

      \ Then, modify your deck as you play to adapt it and beat your opponents.<br></li><li><strong>Play\
      \ at your own pace</strong> Optional turn timer allows for either long, calculated\
      \ matches over several days or for quicker, casual skirmishes that you can play\
      \ in a single sitting.<br></li><li><strong>Play as distinct factions for asymmetrical\
      \ gameplay</strong> Conquer the galaxy as the quick, alien Sylith faction or\
      \ the steadfast, human-descended Coalition.<br></li><li><strong>Free starter\
      \ decks</strong> Every faction gets a free starter deck, and all players receive\
      \ starter decks each time they are released, completely for free.<br></li><li><strong>New\
