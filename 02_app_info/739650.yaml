    about_the_game: "Welcome to The Hollow, a blighted and dying place, and home to\
      \ the Drakes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrakes are the vegetable folk native to these\
      \ parts, and they need your help. They\u2019re hungry, thirsty, and need a place\
      \ to sleep. They can literally die of boredom. It\u2019s on you to save them.\
      \ Build gardens to provide them with food, wells for water, and yoga balls and\
      \ puppet shows to keep them entertained. Even treadmills and solar panels to\
      \ generate power for Tesla coils and electric fences, as you will quickly see\
      \ they need some protecting...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Drakes aren\u2019t the\
      \ only residents of The Hollow - The Feral have overrun the land, looking to\
      \ shred anything happy or good. Battle them one-on-one with a wide array of\
      \ weapons ranging from tennis rackets to nail guns, bring your friends to lend\
      \ a hand, and build your defenses so you can take them out without lifting a\
      \ finger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTravel from region to region, season to season,\
      \ taking the Drakes and their village with you. Each region is over a square\
      \ mile of territory to explore, dynamically generated and populated with each\
      \ passing season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must balance your time carefully. What\
      \ supplies are most crucial at any given moment? What does your village need?\
      \ Metal from the supply caches to build your defenses, or crystals from the\
      \ blighted regions to grow your Drakes? Prove that you\u2019ve got what it takes\
      \ to help the Drakes and take back The Hollow."
