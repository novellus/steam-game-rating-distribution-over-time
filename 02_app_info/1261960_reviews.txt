Just like the Arcade back in the day. I really can recommend this game so far. There are issues I haven't looked into and I'm not too wild about the lack of full screen (or maybe I played first now I can look for a full screen fix if any). \n\nI really like the music, filled with all the 90's goodness the game has to offer. I really enjoyed that time because it was a TRUE Renaissance for the Shooter genre. Some people were getting burned out and it wasn't quite as possible and for a time we had REAL GEMS released in the genre like Lightning Force (Thunderforce 4 - BEST Music in a Shooter EVER), M.U.S.H.A (An UTTER Surprise when it came out and an INSTANT CLASSIC), Eliminate Down (UNDERAPPRECIATED Japanese Mega Drive GEM - REALLY Expensive too), Axelray/Axelay (AWESOME shooter - Top 5 BEST SNES Shooters EVER), STARFOX (OBVIOUSLY), R-Type 3, Space MegaForce (The Most Seriously UNDERAPPRECIATED Shooter EVER on ANY System - SNES), The PS1 and Sega Saturn classics, the 90's were an awesome time for shooter fans and this game really brings that feeling home again.  \n\nBack to the game, the graphics are nice and sharp, the music is EXCELLENT. There seems to be ZERO slowdown or lag but I have only played single player, I have not tried Co-Op yet. It controls very well using an X-Box 360 controller. I have not tried the keyboard like I normally do but I'll look into it. The extra fighters are appreciated and every thing from the arcade is there. Overall the game is a SOLID 8 to 9 for me. It is well worth buying it RIGHT NOW during the sale. At the current sale price you can't really lose on this purchase!","timestamp_created":1609291157,"timestamp_updated":1609359578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwucrT2vYCc8HQvgI="}
