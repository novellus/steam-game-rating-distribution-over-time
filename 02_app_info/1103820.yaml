      /><br>The days when the eastern frontier of our kingdom was a safe home for
      new settlers are gone forever. The enemy has grown strong and bares his fangs
      with hatred. His beastly eyes are turned to the lands that the heavens have
      given us to care for.<br><br>The savage hordes no longer fear our weapons. It
      is not the first time they have invaded our territory to rape, loot and terrorize
      our people.<br><br>The Great Wall, which has kept us safe for generations, is
      in a deplorable state. The once impassable dam, a glorious monument to the building
      craftsmanship of our fathers, is only a shadow of our former power.<br><br><img

      /><br>The wall has been was destroyed. The remaining debris will serve as a
      base for rebuilding it. Along with a handful of people at your side, you not
      only need to restore it to the past glory but also you must strengthen it to
      resist the next invasion of the approaching enemy army.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1103820/extras/02---Explore_Collect-resources_mix_white_2.gif?t=1607685750"
      /><br>Send your subjects to gather raw materials both in your kingdom and in
      unknown territories belonging to the wild horde. Help needy inhabitants of nearby
      villages and explore lost ruins for ancient artifacts.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1103820/extras/03----Develop-your-base,-build-an-army_mix_white2.gif?t=1607685750"
      /><br>Increasing the size of the army and its appropriate rearmament is quite
      a challenge. Build new structures that will allow you to recruit specialists
      and make further improvements to the bastions.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1103820/extras/04---Watch,-plan_mix_white2.gif?t=1607685750"
      /><br>Be alert and prepared for everything. Plan well the reconstruction of
      the border bridgehead by deploying guards on the walls and towers to watch the
      border. Remember to occasionally inspect whether any enemy saboteurs have breached
      the wall.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1103820/extras/05---Defend-the-wall-from-strangers_white2.gif?t=1607685750"
      /><br>Teach a lesson to every invader who comes out of the forest attempting
      to break through our land. Sound the bell to call your subjects to the wall
      and direct their actions on the battlefield.<br><br><strong>PREPARE YOURSELF
      FOR A GREAT INVASION!</strong><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1103820/extras/06_-__Get_ready.gif?t=1607685750"
      /><br>It has long been rumored that deep in the heart of the wilderness the
      enemy army is gathering for another big invasion. Rebuild and reinforce your
      wall and your army enough to survive when it finally arrives.
