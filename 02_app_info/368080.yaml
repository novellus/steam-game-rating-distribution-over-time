    review: "Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan, is a single-player action role-playing\
      \ game, in which the player controls main character [i]Enzo Kori-Odan[/i]. The\
      \ gameworld is a two dimensional setting, which the player can explore. Six\
      \ surrounding continents must be visited to forge an alliance against his brother-in-law.\
      \ Combat is in real-time, like a brawler. The game puts emphasis on making combos\
      \ to defeat enemies. The player character Enzo can summon [i]Aurion[/i], an\
      \ ancient energy, which can be used in Aurionic modes, allowing for powerful\
      \ abilities. The player can unlock greater abilities and increase their power\
      \ as he develops and continues on his journey to defeat his brother-in law,\
      \ save his Kingdom Zama and become one with the Kori-Odan.\n\nThe game feels\
      \ like a throw back to games that we loved as kids. I told one of my good friends\
      \ after putting 9 hours into it, I wish we had this 30 years ago when I played\
      \ Nintendo, back in the 80's. It is comparable to [i]Tales of Destiny, Dust:An\
      \ Elysian Tail,[/i] with combat that is reminiscent to Street Fighter and Double\
      \ Dragon. The story is great, albeit I do think they should hire an editor to\
      \ make a few updates on the dialogue so it can flow smoother. There are quite\
      \ a bit of typos, but the writers are Cameroonian so I understand. I still think\
      \ the story is awesome. \n\n[u]About the protagonists[/u]\nEnzo is naive at\
      \ first, ala Luke Skywalker. Not understanding his potential. His teacher is\
      \ dark and reminds me a lot of Mace Windu, a female version that can balance\
      \ her mind and do what is necessary for the Kori-Odan; even if it means putting\
      \ down the people of Zama who interfere with her protection of Enzo. Then there\
      \ is the Queen, Erine. She is loyal and persuasive, everything you want in a\
      \ woman, if you are a King of course.  \n\n[u]This is what we need in the future\
      \ of gaming[/u]\nImagine a 3D world, where the fantasy setting is structured\
      \ like Africa. For so long we have been programmed to embrace European and Asian\
      \ fantasy where the protagonist is Caucasian and the antagonist is Black and\
      \ most likely a coward. This is why Enzo is special. He is African and he is\
      \ a hero, with nobility, pride and great skills. I personally would like to\
      \ see this game expand and become bigger. It has great lore already and history\
      \ that can be developed into something like Elder Scrolls or the Witcher. Elder\
      \ Scrolls started off as 2d, something to consider. I went ahead and bought\
      \ three copies and gifted it to two of my close friends. I hope more people\
      \ support this project, so that we can see more Black faces in the fantasy genre."
