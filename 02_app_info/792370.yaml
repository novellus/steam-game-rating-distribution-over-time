    review: 'Not a Point n''Click.


      Although mouse-only, this is in fact a puzzle-platformer, with emphasis on the
      platforming.

      Very annoying platforming.

      Every misstep, every misclick, every mistiming, you die and the current puzzle
      is entirely reset.

      Half the time, you''ll die because your click didn''t register at all. Sometimes,
      because you clicked 2 pixels too much to the right, so the path-finding didn''t
      feel the need to wake up and thus your character didn''t move. Because of...


      Timers.


      That''s right, everything is timed.

      You clicked on a "button" ? Quickly move away from it or you die. Move both
      characters at once, on different paths, as soon as you''ve clicked, for if any
      one of them dies, you die. Sometimes the thing you clicked has a delayed response,
      so you have to order your timings and your moves to avoid the dreaded full reset.


      Hey! More incompetent design: The game starts with you listening to 10 minutes
      of gibberish. Or, in fact, reading subtitles, since the sound is... you know...
      gibberish. I like made up languages as much as the next masochist but come on
      guys, 10 minutes? And that''s because I found out the acceleration key and skipped
      from then on.


      And it''s buggy, to top it all. You have objects losing their interactivity,
      so you''ll need to die to reset. You can get soft-locked when 1 character goes
      too far and can''t open the path for the 2nd one any more, and there is nothing
      to kill him, and no key to reset, so you have to quit and come back and redo
      some previous puzzles. Barely in the first puzzles, I''m already covered in
      bugs.


      Not a good puzzle-platformer.

      At all.
