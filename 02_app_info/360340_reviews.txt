I'm only a little miffed about the lack of the credits music, but I'm sure I can pick it up off the internet somewhere.\n\nThe gameplay of this DLC is just straight electrical diagram building, in a similar vein to the ones in the original game. You have diagrams to build, but there's a twist - you build it with whatever you are given, a bit like IKEA except you're always able to finish it.\n\nOne annoying thing you'll find is a lot of the HUD tends to get in the way of the board, and rotating older placed parts is sometimes a chore as you'll probably first put your current tile on it instead so you'll have to go back and re-select the older tile again before you can rotate it... ugh. They could have added a few puzzles on a larger grid too, or allowed it to zoom out.\n\nAnyway, if you're a completionist this'll be a breeze - if you get stuck you can just look up the solution. But to get your value for money I suggest sticking at it. Either that or get it when it's discounted.","timestamp_created":1589035447,"timestamp_updated":1589035478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6X5/PECd6PShgI="}
