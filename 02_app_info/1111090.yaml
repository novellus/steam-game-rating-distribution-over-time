    about_the_game: "This is an open world game with no boundaries, including survival,\
      \ battle, capture, strategy, construction, exploration, mining and other game\
      \ elements. In a vary far future, human technology has reached an unimaginable\
      \ state: maximizing resource utilization and recycling, using robots, and industrial\
      \ efficiency. All science and knowledge has reached its peak and has begun to\
      \ explore the distant universe. It starts with the galaxy closest to the earth:\
      \ Alpha Lyrae.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you come to this distant galaxy, you\
      \ bring all the technology and some robots to build. The only thing missing\
      \ is resources. However, this discovered planet is rich in resources and almost\
      \ unlimited, it is a combination of beauty. The planet has various terrains:\
      \ grasslands, ice fields, snow, rivers, lakes, seas, mountains, valleys, hills,\
      \ forests, volcanoes, swamps, deep pits, deserts. There are also various resource\
      \ points: stone rock, clay, petroleum, magma ... etc. Different resource points\
      \ can be mined and used in different ways. For example, water resources can\
      \ be pumped, nuclear power plants can be built, and large pumping stations can\
      \ be built. Metals can be refined next to magma, geothermal power can be generated,\
      \ and obsidian bricks can be made. Players can also change or expand the terrain\
      \ through some equipment. Different terrains will also affect each other. For\
      \ example, the river flowing through the magma will change the magma into obsidian\
      \ rock, and the magma flowing through the ice layer will melt the ice layer.\
      \ Digging a valley allows magma or river water to flow through.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nHowever, abundance of resources also means that there are many competitors.\
      \ It is not just us on the planet. Abundant resources also cultivate countless\
      \ and huge creatures. It is known that these creatures usually live underground\
      \ and are very sensitive to industrial noise and can cause aggressiveness. When\
      \ increasing industrialization, higher noise will attract stronger and more\
      \ enemies. They will be drilled from the ground, so it is important to build\
      \ a hard floor, because you do not want it to drill from the ground of your\
      \ base. Swamps and pits have stronger enemies, and monsters tend to emerge from\
      \ these places.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are advised to be cautious and strategically\
      \ expanding. While taking resources a little bit, it is also necessary to establish\
      \ security defense measures to resist monster attacks. The player's task is\
      \ to search this planet, collect the necessary planet information, and finally\
      \ build a large communication array to transfer your survival experience and\
      \ information back to Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is open to the greatest\
      \ degree of freedom. There are no level settings. The game mode and progress\
      \ are dominated by players. Players can play multiple characters on the same\
      \ map, and each character is a new beginning. Each character can transfer resources\
      \ by placing resources on the map. We are already developing a multiplayer connection\
      \ mode, and features will be released one after another. This game is updated\
      \ weekly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n1. Works will be finished by\
      \ drones. Player can make more drones to increase working efficiency. So, the\
      \ role need not to finish work one by one.<br />\r\n2. The world has no boundary.\
      \ It means there are infinite resources. Player can build anywhere, even to\
      \ build a super huge base.<br />\r\n3. For exploring the world, there are sea,\
      \ plane, mountain and hills. There are also underground area for mining.<br\
      \ />\r\n4. We update weekly."
