      \ you are tasked to complete objectives such as bringing order to chaos. There\
      \ are more objectives such as rescuing multiple hostages, arresting or neutralizing\
      \ specific suspects and more which are being added down the line. Suspects may\
      \ or may not have patrolling routes that are random every session and can interact\

      \ as a shield, making it harder for you to engage. Suspects can also surrender\

      \ true online tactical gameplay. We want to thank our community for the tremendous\
      \ support and patience everyone has shown. Join our discord and get closer to\
      \ the community and the game\u2019s development. We hope you enjoy the game!\
      \ We would like to clear a few things before you head in to make sure you have\
      \ the optimal experience. <br><br><strong>Regions</strong><br>Please make sure\
      \ you select your proper region to get the best ping possible. You can always\
      \ change the region through the settings&gt;Gameplay menu. Also make sure if\
      \ you are playing with friends that you all are in the same region to make sure\
      \ no one is left behind when queuing for a match. <br><br><strong>Key Binding</strong><br>Key\
      \ Binding works but still can cause issues for few individuals. For them the\
      \ best way to make sure you do not face issues in binding (as for now you cannot\
      \ bind in game); please make sure that you don't bind an action with a key used\
      \ in another action. If you want to do so, please change that binding to another\
      \ key before changing your preferred action key.<br><br><strong>Training Ground</strong><br>When\
      \ you get in the game you will be first required to go through training, make\
      \ sure in training you set up your sensitivity and basic settings. Go through\
      \ the kill house which is in the other room. For the kill house follow the arrows\
      \ to start in correct order. There are 21 targets in the kill house, many taking\
      \ corners. If you miss one of them the trial will fail. Even if trial fails\
      \ you can still head back to main menu and start quick match.<br><br><strong>Voice\
      \ Chat</strong><br>Always use the voice chat to cooperate with your team members,\
      \ as it is very important in our game. Not having proper team communication\
      \ can lead to losing rounds.<br><br><strong>101 Trailer</strong><br>Revise and\
      \ go through the 101 Trailer 1 more time before heading in as it explains many\
      \ of the features in game. It will really help you head starting the game.<br>Link\
