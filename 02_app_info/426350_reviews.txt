I really liked his performance in The Transporter. Took notice of him from then on, from films such as Cellular, The Bank Job, and then there's this film, Crank. I saw it in theaters and have the DVD, but gave it a rental viewing here for convenience sake (and to try out watching movies with Steam...bizarre to think that a game app outlet has come this far, that they are offering films for purchase now). When I did grab it, it was only available for rental. Now I see there's an offer to buy. Anyway I'm getting off-track here.\n\nTo summarize, Crank is an adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, crazy and comedic film. It's over the top silly, with Statham running around town like a madman, causing havoc and killing plenty of men to stay alive. At the beginning of the film, we see him get injected with some kind of poison. The poison is meant to slow down his heart until it gives out and he dies. To counter this, Statham's character, Chev Chelios, has to keep his adrenaline pumping. In doing that, he can prolong the effects of the drug that was given to him and he does so with one goal in mind: To kill the men who backstabbed him. \n\nIt's hysterical, to see this actor who is typcasted into usual tough-guy agent-like roles, usually silent and bad-ass, to this more wild and curse-happy individual, screaming at the top of his lungs and be percieved as psychotic. Even better, it's done well! It's a little gore-y and very over-the-top, the idea is rather silly to begin with so it's not for everyone, but I'm recommending it. High entertainment value, no holds-barred action flick. It's got cliches thrown in like a car chase, but the focal point of the movie is always in the lead, never losing focus. It's actually brilliant how many ways the writers thought up how to keep the flow of adrenaline running in someomen. Don't try this at home, though, plenty of feats on here would kill. \n\nIf you're looking for a good popcorn flick (that's rated R), look no further!","timestamp_created":1463862794,"timestamp_updated":1463862794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656872391700744629","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8bLB6tQCe4mbWA=="}
