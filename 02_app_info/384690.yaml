    review: 'This is one of the greatest platformers ever made, and it is so disheartening
      to see it overlooked time and time again. With the lastest entry in the franchise
      being such a departure from the core gameplay, I am afraid people will be turned
      off from the series which is a shame. I only have a few hours on the steam release,
      but plenty more on it''s original release console, the super famicom. It has
      the best grappling mechanics in any game I''ve ever played even 20+ years after
      it''s release. For such a low price, it is criminal to not give this game a
      chance for those that love platformers.


      Umihara Kawase is a game that has a low barrier of entry, but a high skill ceiling
      for those that want to master it''s mechanics (just watch speedruns to see the
      crazy maneuvers you can do). It is set up as an arcade game of sort, where you
      have a limited time to clear as many levels as possible with ten lives. Each
      level is full of bright visuals, wonderful music and challenging obstacles and
      enemies to overcome. Each level has one or many exit doors that take you to
      different stages, until you reach an ending door that ends the game for you.
      This gives the game tons of replayability, as you won''t see every level in
      each playthrough. The biggest problem with the game that might be a turn off
      for some people is the annoying boss fights and frequent enemy respawn rate.
      These two problems can be managed, as you can technically choose a route that
      has no boss fights and you get used to the enemy respawn rates eventually. Some
      of the later levels become very challenging and will be run killers for you
      early on, but there is a handy practice mode that gives you infinite tries to
      beat a level.


      I personally haven''t had any problems with the pc port, and I actually feel
      it runs better here than on it''s original hardware. I also had no problem with
      setting up controller support, but I can''t speak for every person here. This
      game is a fantastic gem that should not be skipped. The other two Umihara Kawase
      games in the trilogy pack (Umihara Kawase Shun and Sayonara Umihara Kawase)
      are also pretty good, but my favorite is the first game and is the best place
      to start with the series.'
