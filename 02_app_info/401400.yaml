    about_the_game: Synonymy is a non-profit, educational word game narrated by Richard
      Dawkins that challenges players to find a path between random words through
      their network of synonyms. By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym
      of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in the
      English language. This lite version is free but has limited difficulty and multiplayer
      functionality. It is otherwise identical to the full version except for a locally
      served ad prompting you to upgrade to the full version. Thank you for trying
      the game and for your support!
