    about_the_game: "A ROOM BEYOND, is fantasy point and click adventure based on\
      \ essential subjects of human existence. This novel game draws the drama around\
      \ the \u201CFog Wanderer\u201D, a murderous apparition scaring a small village\
      \ in a Lovecraftian world. Help the villagers to solve the murder mystery and\
      \ discover your own fate which seems to be oddly woven into the entire drama.<br>\
      \ <br>A philosophical story is built upon inspiration coming from the book <i>The\
      \ Top Five Regrets of the Dying</i>. Videogames such as <i>Alone in the Dark\
      \ 1</i>, <i>The Last Door</i> and the famous <i>Lucas Arts games</i> significantly\
      \ influenced the general tone and coloring of the game, as well as the art of\
      \ <i>H.P. Lovecraft</i> and <i>E.A. Poe</i>. The game\u2019s innovative mix\
      \ of pixelart and low-poly rendering has attracted a lot of interest among players\
      \ and artists.<br> <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/454330/extras/Screenshot-2016_03_14_175322720__617px.png?t=1563533546\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis</h2><br>When you awake, you find yourself\
      \ trapped in a gloomy cave. Dim candle light reveals strange symbols and cult\
      \ objects all over this place. You can\u2019t remember what happened, but this\
      \ place gives you shivers. There is a tiny ray of light in the distance which\
      \ might lead to a room beyond this darkness. <br><br>Outside the cave you find\
      \ yourself in a forest which is surrounded by deep gorges and thick layers of\
      \ fog. A crowd of people lives here in fear of an ominous apparition that creeps\
      \ through the fog for manhunt. <br><br>Help the villagers to solve the mystery\
      \ of the murderous fog wanderer and uncover the fate that brings you to this\
      \ place.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/454330/extras/Screenshot-2016_03_14_174856896__617px.png?t=1563533546\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Simplified control of the game can\
      \ be learned fast and allows a quick start. No strong prior experiences with\
      \ computer games are needed for playing A Room Beyond. All interactions can\
      \ be accomplished by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer. The game does not\
      \ define specific timing so that players can take their time to explore the\
      \ virtual world. Additonal game features are unlocked gradually while progressing\
      \ storyline.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/454330/extras/Screenshot-2016_03_14_174730190__617px.png?t=1563533546\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Technology &amp; Style</h2><br><i>2.5D Perspective:</i>\
      \ The game\u2019s visual perspective is known as 2.5D, which describes a combination\
      \ of 3D effects in a general 2D stage design. Both types bring their own benefits\
      \ to the game: Interaction and navigation is easy in a 2D scenery, but visual\
      \ perception of depth is increased by using 3D objects. <br><br><i>Pixel Style:</i>\
      \ Manual and procedural processing steps create a mosaic-like pixel effect which\
      \ results in a graphical abstraction that increases the scope of visual interpretation\
      \ and stimulates players\u2019 imagination. Combination of both, smooth animations\
      \ brought by modern technology and the look and feel of retro pixel game design\
      \ leads to a fresh  contemporary graphic style.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/454330/extras/vlcsnap-2016-11-03-10h35m11s829__617px.png?t=1563533546\"\
