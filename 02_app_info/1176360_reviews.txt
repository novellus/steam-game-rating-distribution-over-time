I was pretty harsh on this game in my review, it was fun, but it's broken AND it needs a lot of work. Lower the price to 1.99 and I can recommend the game for what it is currently. If you EVER want to get $11.99 you'll have to do a lot of work.\n\nFix the menus and ensure they work properly, Change the crazy red and blue light color scheme, it's headache inducing, it makes the game more difficult AND it doesn't look good.\n\nThe AI needs it's pathing updated, they should actively avoid obstacles, such as chairs and tables, when making their way to the player, They also need the same kind of accuracy as the player, They literally don't miss unless you're moving AND they shoot through tiny door openings or walls constantly.\n\nWhen you're standing over a weapon to pickup, have something above the player showing which will be picked up, WHY can't I change my 4th weapon... WHY does the weapon get thrown when I'm trying to pick another one up? \n\nThe controller, Unity has built in gamepad support, utilize it, There are TONS of tutorial videos on how this works. You won't have to do ANYTHING aside from plug it into your char_controller.cs (or however you have it named)\n\nDifficult is one thing, this game is beyond that.\n\nPlease devs keep working on it, you've got a great base, this game can definitely be awesome. Please don't take this as an attack, I'd like to think it's more constructive criticism.\n\ncheckout my review on youtube\n\nhttps://youtu.be/edzkg9VyTRw","timestamp_created":1597230268,"timestamp_updated":1597840216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532467544078826904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Nmsg/QCccX9mgI="}
