Has some great tunes and they found a great way of intertwining classical music with modern music. Specialy the last song is EPIC.\nOnly thing I'm finding a bit frustrating is the randomness of the bonus notes for hitting 10 perfect notes, most of the time they rly don't fit into the hand movements on the keyboard. But other than that, I've had a rly great time with this game series. 8/10","timestamp_created":1609235866,"timestamp_updated":1609235866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmdT71vYCf7uyvgI="}
