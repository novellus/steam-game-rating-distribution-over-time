      Digital Edition is a faithful adaptation of a strategic board game ranked in
      Top 20 board games of all time. Plan ahead and make crucial decisions every
      turn. Always be prepared to make a trade off - your actions can very well benefit
      other players as well as yourself.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1450330/extras/centurion-1.png?t=1607442503"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">What is Concordia? </h2><br>Concordia: Digital Edition
      is a turn-based strategy game where 2 to 6 players face each other in the fight
      for wealth and influence. You will build your trade empire on one of several
      maps of the ancient world. Using actions on the cards you will plan and execute
      your strategy to get an edge on your competition. Each of your decisions can
      benefit both you and your opponents. Send your colonists to new cities, across
      the land or sea and build houses to expand your trade empire!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1450330/extras/dagmara-1.png?t=1607442503"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">What makes Concordia great?</h2><br>Concordia is a game
      with rules that are easy to learn, but mastering it can take a lifetime! With
      additional maps and expansions along the way (all the official ones, in fact),
      the replayability of Concordia: Digital Edition is near infinite. Play against
      the AI or challenge your friends in the hot seat mode or online cross platform
      multiplayer on PC, iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch. The authentic feel of the
      board game, along with the intuitive UI makes it the perfect addition to your
