The convience store is only half filled (with missing textures everywhere), the sound doesnt work, the game can be completed in less than 2 minutes, and it suffers from low framerates at times.  In addition, the controls are jenky and the game itself is just really boring.  Wouldnt even be worth it for a free game.\n\nFirst Impression Gameplay: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DjXIz9H8gA&feature=youtu.be\n\nI understand the game is in early access, but honestly this is not even early access worthy.\n\nWhat could make this game better?\n-different stores to visit and store types\n-variety in the shopping list\n-sound\n-maybe enviromental varieties\n-other customers and interactions\n-a more interacticve enviroment (the microwave opens but doesnt work)\n\nThe concept is kind of there, as I think people might enjoy a simulated shopping experience, but the concept is poorly executed in this case.\n\nUsually I write a more significant review, but there is nothing more to say.  Pass on this one unless it goes through some serious updates.","timestamp_created":1518720190,"timestamp_updated":1518721323,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574586927890777588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/4m2zeECdJD/mAE="}
