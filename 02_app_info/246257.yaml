    review: One of two DLCs that add background music to Pac-Man Championship Edition
      DX+, the Reentrance BGM is a (pretty good) remixed version of the main menu
      theme. I recommend it, but, as with every other DLC for this game, it'd be better
      to grab them all as part of the All You Can Eat bundle.
