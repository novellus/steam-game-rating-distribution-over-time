I really can’t say the idea is bad, but the execution… Oh boy.\n\nI don’t want to be too harsh since this game is clearly made by a small company or maybe even by one person alone, so I will say the good things with the game first:\n\n- Good idea, as I just said.\n- Good achievement farming game. This game clearly has achievement farming in mind, and many games like this exists, but they tend to be utter bullshit, dirt in the eye, shit in the stomach, games you would rather fuck a donkey than to play it again. So if you have in mind that this game is another achievement farmer, it is great actually, maybe the best of this category.\n- Sound effects on point.\n- Really creative name.\n- Did not make false advertising in the Steam page. This is the minimum every game should do, but the fact that the video is a simple gameplay and not an overly-edited video, really captures how the game actually is, instead of trying to be misleading.\n- Really cheap.\n\nThat sums up all the good things, now let’s see the bad ones.\n\n- Fucked up graphics. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind graphics, I am used to playing old games so really I don’t give a shit about how the game looks, but FPS is just too much. The game is apparently made in Unreal Engine, which makes the lighting and motion blur beautiful, and the gun is well-made, but everything else is just a solid color, not even a gradient. You either make a realistic game, or a simple-looking game, you can’t do both, or it looks like shit. The text after finishing a stage is also a solid color, doesn’t even have border colors, and it is the most basic font ever.\n\n- Lack of music. Seriously, just watch the video. It feels soooo empty and makes you give up quickly, but hey, it’s better to have no music than to have a 3 second loop of an annoying, ear-bleeding song, so maybe it’s not THAT bad.\n\n- Only one type of puzzle. For a game of which its entire premise is to be a “Fun Puzzle Shooter”, all you do is shoot balls through squares.\n\n- Shit physics. Sometimes it just doesn’t work well. Your ball just bumps into the corner of a square and goes flying.\n\n- Repetitive. This is obvious, but you WILL get bored. I can’t see someone playing this game for more than 20 minutes. I have played for a little over an hour but it really feels like it was eight hours.\n\n- The game is yet another achievement farmer. I know this was sort of a good point before, but you just see how much blood and sweat the development team put in this game: NONE.\nI’m sorry, but you can’t make an achievement farmer and expect us to take the game seriously. If you want to make a respected game, then don’t make another game that people buy only to show off their achievements on Steam. I really struggle to respect a game made for the sole reason of being used as a token, or as a braggin mechanism.\nIn the beginning I said I didn’t want to be too harsh, but just the fact that this is an achievement farmer makes it hard for me to cope with the developers. Y’all aren’t making a game, y’all are exploiting Steam and people. It’s not a surprise that a lot of achievement farmers end up getting removed.\nIt’s not cool to see 50 achievements popping up per level if you want to have a good experience playing.\n\n- It’s cheap, but it should really be cheaper, for real, possibly free. I would have neutral opinions about it if it was free.\n\nFor the gamers, do yourself a favor and don’t buy this. To the developers, please make a game with your heart and soul. Many people would kill to be able to create what you did, but you clearly made it without any love, any attention, and without worrying about the game itself.\n\nTo end it, the game is good in the first 2 minutes, then it's boring, then it's bad. I would rather use the money to buy one (1) small snack, and I am not overreacting.\n\nAbsolutely do not recommend.","timestamp_created":1518482436,"timestamp_updated":1606847924,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8rDmj/YCeqfcmAE="}
