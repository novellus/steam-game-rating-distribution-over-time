    review: "Greetings!  Today we will be looking over the Priority Mission DLC \u201C\
      Poisoned Souls\u201D which is a series of missions loosely themed around a narrative\
      \ with a reward unique to the DLC at the end.  But is it worth the $3?\n\nNot\
      \ so fine Warp Dust:  Another choose-your-own-adventure style mission type\u2026\
      but it only gave me one real choice at the beginning.  I\u2019m really starting\
      \ to get disappointed with the \u2018story\u2019 of these missions, the first\
      \ ones had several branches and I was looking forward to trying them again when\
      \ they reset but the last few only give you one or two options.\n\nThe reward\
      \ of this is a good one, a inoculator mod that gives you class resource and\
      \ probably would be great for most builds in some way, I just wish the content\
      \ before was worth it.  I\u2019d only recommend this for the reward and that\
      \ makes me give it a thumbs down because it does make it feel like the item\
      \ is the only reason to get it, enjoy!"
