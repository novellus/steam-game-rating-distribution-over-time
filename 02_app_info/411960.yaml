      \ /><br><br>G'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind\
      \ you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised\
      \ by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've\
      \ always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.<br><br>But\
      \ then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but\
      \ trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see\
      \ they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!<br><br>You\
      \ see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is\
      \ a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings\
      \ in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you\
      \ have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal\
      \ to the Dreaming will open!<br><br>Now, before you go off like a frog in a\
      \ sock, there's just this one <strong><i>SMALL</i></strong> problem. You see\
      \ there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans.\
      \ Yes. <strong><i>THAT</i>[/b boss cass. the one that trapped your family in\
      \ the dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the\
      \ meat pies from the tuck shops. and if you didn't think that made him enough\
      \ of a megalomaniac, he's [b]<i>ALSO</i>[/b trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby\
      \ mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books...\
      \ Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen\
      \ to the Talismans!<br>Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a\
      \ bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate,\
      \ Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue\
      \ your family!</strong>"

    review: Loved this game from when I was a kid. Just fun to go around wacking frilled
      lizards with boomerangs. Only recommend it fi you played when you were young
      or if you are interested in the gameplay.
