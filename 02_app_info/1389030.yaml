      notes: Players can expect to find gore often as they fight enemies throughout
        the game. However, the depictions of gore are not realistic as they are in
        games like Hotline Miami.

    review: Although short but sweet, it's an inspiring example of what can be done
      in the Godot Game Engine. Unlocked all the content (I think?) after nearly half
      an hour, but the game's pretty cheap at only $2.99 so at least it isn't overpriced
      like SUPERHOT is.
