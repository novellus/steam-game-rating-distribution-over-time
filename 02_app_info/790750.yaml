    review: "*** April 14, 2019 UPDATE ***\n\nGame has now gone free to play. I am\
      \ changing my review from negative to positive. Hopefully now that that it's\
      \ free, more players will play it. \n\nYou can view my updated review & gameplay\
      \ here: https://youtu.be/J5fr2tyscaU\n\n*** Original Review BELOW ***\n\n[h1]\
      \ Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\nThis game currently\
      \ has 26 reviews (I'm 27th) and only 1 of those is a negative review. However,\
      \ of the 26 current reviews, only 7 of them are from Steam purchase reviewers.\
      \ There's nothing wrong with that, but it can leave a very wrong impression\
      \ of this game. In reality, this game has 7 reviewers from Steam purchasers\
      \ and 1 of those is negative. And now it will have 8 reviews from Steam purchases\
      \ and 2 of those will be negative.\n\nIs this a bad game? No! In fact, I hope\
      \ that more people buy this game so that there is a nice-sized playerbase. The\
      \ game is actually pretty fun. But the game has two very big negatives that\
      \ I just can't ignore, which makes it a game that I can't recommend to others.\
      \ So while I'm giving a negative review, I would be happy to change my review\
      \ if at least one of those negatives can be changed. For now, it is a slightly\
      \ negative / neutral recommendation.\n\nBut first, let me talk about the good\
      \ as briefly as I can. This game has several customization options. From movement\
      \ options, to comfort options, to game visuals. You can do private or public\
      \ matches. You can play with or without bots. You can play capture the flag\
      \ or bomb mode. You change sides and best 2 out of 3 wins the match. This game\
      \ has 3 classes. An assault class, a tank class, and a scout class. You can\
      \ pick any class and you will still have fun with this game because they all\
      \ have the same core ability (shooting a bow fast), but different special abilities\
      \ (tank and scout share fast movement ability). I really liked the bomb mode.\
      \ The game currently only has 3 maps. There's verticality to each map. None\
      \ of the maps are especially large, but that's good given the range of the weapons\
      \ and the locomotion speed.\n\nSo I think the game needs more maps and needs\
      \ a TDM or FFA, but the game is currently in EA so that's not really my main\
      \ gripe. Plus since they lowered the price to $9.99, it's priced correctly.\
      \ However, the two big flaws that I can't ignore are these: \n\n1) No playerbase\
      \ - does anybody play this game? Obviously, this is not the dev's fault. The\
      \ VR playerbase is small and most PvP games /MP games fail, especially in VR.\
      \ This game has bots so at least it has value regardless. But still, this game\
      \ is probably only fun if you have friends with VR. Players will probably not\
      \ come at this point in this game's cycle, no matter how much we wish it.\n\n\
      2) Bow mechanic. This is probably the fatal flaw that I just can't look past.\
      \ It just doesn't feel great shooting this thing. It feels too much like arcade,\
      \ it needs to feel more realistic. There's so many VR bow & arrow games and\
      \ this game's bow & arrow just don't feel great, it feels average. Seems like\
      \ you can't really aim. This developer should take a cue from how the bow &\
      \ arrow feels like in the best bow & arrow VR titles such as: In Death, Holopoint,\
      \ The Lab, QuiVR, or Marksman VR. This game should just copy the bow from Holopoint,\
      \ it would fit this game style perfectly!\n\nMy other mini-gripe is the bow-hand\
      \ shield. Since you can move freely, the arm shield makes little sense. If you\
      \ teleported only, the shield would make great sense. However, I can't think\
      \ of many situations where I wouldn't just move to avoid an arrow versus using\
      \ my shield. You can keep your bow & arrow ready to shoot and move out of the\
      \ way > using shield.\n\nRate 4.5/10. If you build it, they will come? I'm not\
      \ asking for a refund & I hope I can change my review to positive in the near\
      \ future."
