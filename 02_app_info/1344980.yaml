    review: "Gunpig is a colorful and enjoyable little score attack twinstick shooter,\
      \ starring an adorable cartoony pig character, that has only one thing on his\
      \ mind: shoot aliens and rack up as much cash as possible! \n\nThe game is divided\
      \ into several levels, where you have to find the main baddy and take it out,\
      \ although there are some other objectives sometimes, like shooting barrels\
      \ under a time limit. While flying through the levels, you might also find cleverly\
      \ hidden secrets, and special cards that unlock character graphics and concept\
      \ artworks in the main menu. You can change your weapon by collecting fruits\
      \ from special dispensers - there are a total of 9 different fruits/weapons,\
      \ each one also having an alternative fire mode, ranging from spreads to mines.\n\
      \nThe only minor thing I've noticed while playing is that the wall collision\
      \ is a bit weak on the corners, and it's easy to fly outside the level bounds,\
      \ but it's also equally easy to go back, so it's not that annoying. \n\nIf you\
      \ like twinstick shooters, and need a quick burst of adrenaline every now and\
      \ then, you can't go wrong with Gunpig!"
