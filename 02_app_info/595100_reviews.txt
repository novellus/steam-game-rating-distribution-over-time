No you aren't suposed to pick up every upgrade, you basically make a build depending on the class you pick, these are BASIC RPG mechanics. Though the game is not perfect and it can get boring at times because of the slow movement speed but it is still fun.\n\nBtw if you say that this is a Wolf 3D clone, you have not played the game, the only thing remotely similar are the 90ยบ walls and that is not something exclusive of that game.","timestamp_created":1608039699,"timestamp_updated":1608039699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o9Kos/YCfLS4ugI="}
