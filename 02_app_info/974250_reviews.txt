I expected a very cheap Mario clone with a cat sprite, and was sorely disappointed.   \n\n[h1]Playing as a cat - 20/20[/h1]\nThere's no associated story, but the player sprite is very clearly a cat.\n\n[h1]Acting like a cat - 2/20[/h1]\nIt's called grooming adventure, but you don't actually do any grooming.  Aside from the fact that the end-level flag is a tuna can, there's nothing remotely cat-like about the gameplay here.\n\n[h1]Adorableness Level - 2/20[/h1]\nWhat you see in the screenshots is as cute as it gets.  Once the gameplay starts, any joy you felt will be replaced with frustration.\n\n[h1]Polish - 1/20[/h1]\nThe game runs, which is about as much as I can say about polish.   The menus are super basic, and I had to restart several times due to level-breaking bugs.  Some of the platform movements are so unexpected and unhelpful that I honestly can't tell if it's a game bug or just the developers trying to frustrate me.\n\n[h1]FUN? - 2/20[/h1]\nTeamkerberos' idea of \"fun\" is to confuse, disorient, and frustrate the player.  The standard platform types don't work in consistent ways from level to level, or even within the same level.  The same platform type might be solid at one point, but then a falling or spinning platform the next time you see it.  And you won't know until you jump on it.  (My favorite type of platform just gets flung to the edge of the screen the moment you touch it, and then it can no longer be used!) The only solution is to keep jumping forward at a break-neck pace, only pausing for the briefest moment on each platform.  Which brings us to the cactuses...\n\nAbsolutely anything can have a spikey cactus in it, and you won't know until you jump on it or stand too close.  The platform-confusion pushes you into these cactuses, and then you die.  The goal seems to be to die enough times that you memorize the level and are then able to beat it.  At that point, the idea of \"fun\" is long gone.  With no acheivements, and no idea of progression through the levels, there is absolultely nothing to keep you going.","timestamp_created":1592693990,"timestamp_updated":1592694029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rMf96fICfLmcjwI="}
