Still don't know what the box is for, but I'll figure it out.\nI was looking for a (preferably VR) game for a small price that would give me a bit of that holiday feeling in this rather difficult year. And this game delivered.\nThere are still some minor bugs, and I wouldn't recommend teleporting too much while inside the cabin, as you might accidentally teleport yourself outside and have some trouble getting back in.\nBut overall, if you want to decorate snowmen, but don't have any snow, this is a nice little alternative.","timestamp_created":1608229670,"timestamp_updated":1608229670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwx6n9uPYCfKKAuwI="}
