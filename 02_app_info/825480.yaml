    review: "If you're into weird Japanese / Asian-ish Bullet Hell games ELDR LEGACY\
      \ provides a half an hour of fun. The game is not very challenging in the grand\
      \ scheme of SHMUP / Bullet Hell games and has little to no replay value, but\
      \ I did find myself chugging through its brisk 20-30 minutes of gameplay and\
      \ enjoying what it had to offer. The game itself degenerates a bit into \"mashing\
      \ the teleport / dodge button as you race up the screen\" (the game is a vertical\
      \ scrolling SHMUP) to progress to the next section of the level, but I still\
      \ enjoyed it for what it offered. \n\nThere isn't a whole lot to say about this\
      \ game. There are a variety of random pickups to be had, one set of which affect\
      \ the pattern of your firing / shooting and the other providing effects such\
      \ as mini tornadoes that spawn out of your ... creature? tank? aircraft? Just\
      \ what exactly ARE you on this game? (It looks like a creepy Thomas the Tank\
      \ Engine...) -anyway, the other pickups are AOE type effects that last for a\
      \ limited time, while the other set of pickups affect your firing pattern. Some\
      \ of these were a little too similar to one another (a blue and purple variant\
      \ of a scattershot being the worst offenders) however there are about 7 total\
      \ to be found, which lend to a decent variety. The game also includes seemingly\
      \ random \"bomb\" / screen-clearing effects that you can use if you have enough\
      \ MP, so all of the staples of SHMUP gameplay are present. \n\nELDR LEGACY includes\
      \ a set of 5 levels each with their own unique music, backgrounds, and bosses\
      \ to defeat. While none of the bosses had particularly engaging combat patterns\
      \ (a lot of it is just kiting around similar-looking patterns..) I did appreciate\
      \ the introduction to each level and its mystic content. \n\nThe game features\
      \ annoying line / paragraph breaks in its writing betwe\nen levels which make\
      \ readi\nng it very awk\nward as if the translation was o\nff and they didn't\
      \ know w\nhat format the final game would be taki\nng. \n\nLong story short,\
      \ if you like funky / strange SHMUPs with an Eastern tinge to their content,\
      \ music, or enemy design you'll probably enjoy this game, however at its very\
      \ short total playtime (plus infinite lives seemingly?) and lack of much replay\
      \ value at all (as well as lack of co-op) it's hard to suggest to anyone beyond\
      \ fans of the niche content and genre. For those players, you'll probably enjoy\
      \ its short runtime.\n\n\n-edit- Oh, and the enemies that shoot out the yellow\
      \ balls that trap you and drag you back down the screen are annoying af!! -_-"
