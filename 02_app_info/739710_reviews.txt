It might be different for me with the Samsung Odyssey, but I have the hardest time getting bowling balls to the bosses, so the game kinda just goes on forever. It would be great if it had a few more weapons, or maybe some kind of auto-aiming setup, or something to clear up the monotony. However, it's simple and good for the price.","timestamp_created":1557503292,"timestamp_updated":1557503292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534313738346099854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpsab0eoCe9j2wAE="}
