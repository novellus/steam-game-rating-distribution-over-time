    about_the_game: "Semi-Sweet Tofu is a 2D side scrolling platformer game where\
      \ players have to eat fruit to survive along with using the color you change\
      \ while eating the fruit to defeat the enemies you are faced with. We took things\
      \ from other games and modified them such as \u201CDon\u2019t Starve\u201D when\
      \ you have to eat to survive and added another mechanic too that he fruit you\
      \ eat to survive also give buffs to the player as well as useful to survive\
      \ and progress. You have to jump on platforms and use certain fruit such as\
      \ the apple which gives you a higher jump height to reach certain platforms\
      \ or the banana fruit which gives you movement speed so you can jump further\
      \ or run away from the magician. The core of the gameplay relies on the fruit\
      \ and the ability to use them in a unique way. You can throw fruit at enemies\
      \ to stun them as well as collide with them to destroy them. If you\u2019re\
      \ not the same color as the enemy you\u2019ll take damage but if you are the\
      \ same color you\u2019ll destroy the enemy without taking damage."
