    review: 'Windows 10.


      I have a plain intel i5 PC, nVidia 1050, 8G ram intel chipset motherboard (asian
      board): extremely typical.  I tried a grab bag of "Compatibility Mode Settings",
      all failed UNTIL...


      In addition to suggested settings*, YOU MUST CHOOSE THE "RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR"
      COMPATIBILITY OPTION.  You will only need to do it once.  (for me, it kept asking
      for password like 7 times, wrote to disk,, exited).  I shut off admin mode (needed
      1x only) and WHALA:  game runs fine.  I chose "Windows Xp release 3" and "16
      bit color mode" Compat settings too.


      YOU MUST START THE GAME FROM THE PROGRAM FOLDER (game.exe somewhere in steam''s
      folder system).  You cannot launch it from Steam''s front end wrapper thing.


      AFTER THAT:  runs like most RPGMAKER games, windowed mode runs fine too.


      The game has a big an EXCELLENT completely game guide (.pdf) (hidden) in the
      Steam folder somewheres.


      --------------------

      Haven''t played much yet but saw the guide so I''m going to give this game a
      YES "at some price".  You can probably find the game guide if you want to know
      if it''s worth what the current price is.


      Graphics:  good and some original some rpgmaker re-used


      Music:  higher end, good, and not "the same old rpgmaker" songs i remember.


      Game:  played little, but seems good and the guide shows it''s got some good
      detail to it


      YES RECOMMEND:  but don''t do what I did:  get it working before 2 days expire
      incase you can''t get it to work'
