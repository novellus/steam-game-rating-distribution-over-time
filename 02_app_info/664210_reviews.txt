Amongst the three setups, I prefer the back-to-wall and looking-down arrangements. Looking up is exciting in survival mode, but this arrangement is awfully painful on my neck. \n\nSome glitchy things you may find when teleporting on top of a block: If you don't stand close enough to the center of the block, you end up teleporting to the side of it and then falling down. Not a big deal breaker, but it can throw you off-balance. In the looking-down Solitaire mode. there have been times where I can break certain blocks downward and venture down there like cave exploring. This is cool, but at times you can teleport into 1x1 cube spaces and the visuals start jittering. It's as if your character teleported too close to an object and can't figure out where it should go. Luckily you can teleport away and that'll get you out of that eyesore.\n\nOther than that, not bad for what you're paying.","timestamp_created":1563596392,"timestamp_updated":1563596392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5PDmhuwCfcXbzgE="}
