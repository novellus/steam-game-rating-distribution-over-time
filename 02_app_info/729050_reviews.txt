I felt like I was on the holodeck playing the 24th century classic game.\n\nSolo was fun to practice but the game is even better with friends.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who plays VR. Try playing with fruit or other nontraditional balls.\n\nThere is some glitchiness when you start a level where the leaderboard is visible. The menu is also quite sensative to touch. Overall though it felt really nice.","timestamp_created":1520142137,"timestamp_updated":1520142137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ46obi9+ECfNbZmgE="}
