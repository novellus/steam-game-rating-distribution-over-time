    review: 'My opinion of Horologist''s Legacy is a solid one. The game is a practical
      masterpiece to me. On every playthrough the overlying story seeks deeper and
      deeper into my brain until im able to track the symbolism in every sight I see.


      Oh and the game looks beautiful on Ultra and if you set your contrast to 25-35
      when you''re outside and the sun is out.
