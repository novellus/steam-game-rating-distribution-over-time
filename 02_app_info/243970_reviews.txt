A 3-minute infiltration scene stretches out to become 50 minutes of tactical espionage.\n  You and your team of agents teleport in, sneak past security, steal from guards, hack into their mainframe via electronic warfare, and complete the objective - without getting caught.\n\nSo, here's an example of how a spy action sequence might roll out: \n\n  You finally arrived at  a terminal. As you grabbed the hard drive, the main objective of the mission, you did not realised that a guard strolled into the room and started aiming at you: “Stop right there! Intruder alert!” Other guards became alerted of your presence. No time to lose, you shot the guard who saw you with your dart gun. You and your team have to bail out.\n \n  The next minute is followed by a cat-and-mouse run between the enraged guards and your agents. You and your agents used a variety of cliche gadgets, such as tasers, holograms, door traps and guns mounted with silencers. \n\n  Just as you’ve reached your limits in running towards the exit, an agent gave you a shot of fast acting steroids. It gave you enough energy to reach the exit just in time before the guards are able to stop you.\n\n  Will you be able to reenact the same scene in this game?\n\n  Not exactly. Because, every game is different. No 2 maps are alike.The game gives you a map layout and different grunts (Guards and drones) every time. \n  You’re given the liberty to choose between your actors and actresses(agents), your props (gadgets) and your matrix-style command interface (incognita with hacking programs) to run the show.\n\n  \n  How do you run the show? Well, it’s really up to you how you direct them.\n\nYour agents might sneak in swiftly like the wind, complete the objective and walk out without the guards even realising you were there. This is clearly the most badass movie spy scene that film makers often overlooked.\n\nOr your agents might sneak through by incapacitating everybody in their way. It's cool to use gadgets, but ......\n\nOr maybe your agents will use lethal weapons to kill those guards, take control of drones and turrets and counter attack the guards in the most desperate, cliche, Rambo fashion before escaping?\n\n  Of course, the first is the slickest, coolest and most badass while the last option is probably when you've make a grave mistake and you’re desperately bashing your way through for survival.\n\n Relying on dodgy stealth consumes little budget and looks way cooler.\n Gunnery action and creating a big fuss means you're clumsy af and wasting money on an action flick rather than a spy masterpiece. \n\nUltimately, all of your decision counts as a tactician. Have fun!","timestamp_created":1459069071,"timestamp_updated":1610162555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546269714832305908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h9nK8vYCfL2dVA=="}
