In my case - not really. \n\nI bought this show out of curiosity. \nWas familiar with Doug Benson because of his YouTube channel, but I had never seen one of his live shows.\nI also like American-Stand-Up in general and *nature*, so I thought I would give this a try.\n\nThis hour long video is more like a compilation than a full show.\nThey used some good jokes of every comic and circle through\na couple of times.\n\nThe editing is just not good. Despite the fact that it is only a 480p stream (okay it was 2009 but still...) they used a lot of fake laughs.\nNot only during the cuts from one comic to another which would be okay, they have also used them within the bits sometimes...pretty annoying!\n\nIf you wanna watch a weed-only themed stand up show (and therefore hear some predictable jokes), go for it.\nOtherwise look for specials of C.K., Burr, Rogan, etc. \nWho does not want fresher, more laugh potent-stuff for \naround the same price, right?","timestamp_created":1481722126,"timestamp_updated":1483041872,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660546839237213135","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiOOLptkCdMiXbA=="}
