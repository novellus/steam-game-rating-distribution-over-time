    review: As another reviewer has noted this owes a lot to the Rick Dangerous puzzle
      platformer games. It could do with a little more variety but works well enough.
      It has a tendency to pressurise the player at key points so if you are ok with
      that it might be for you. Or you could check out Rick Dangerous. Recommended
      but only on sale.
