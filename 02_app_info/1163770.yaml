    review: I never expected this kind of story-writing in a silly game such as this.
      This DLC may seem like a way to earn more money, and in two ways it is, but
      the unexpected storyline really hooked me and tied up a lot of loose ends that
      I didn't even know where loose ends. This DLC also allowed the player to have
      a peek into what seems to be the appearance of "The Town", and its inner workings
      (or no-longer-workings). All in all, a great DLC for those who want a bit of
      lore.
