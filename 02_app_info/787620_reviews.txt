Level 67 was tricky for me until I noticed a key detail.\nThe rest were pretty short taking a few minutes or less to solve.  Bear in mind the amount of content is small and don't expect a lengthy challenge.  That being said, all can be solved by logic, which is nice.  The backgrounds change when you restart a level, which is subtle but gives some variety.  Nicely made puzzle experience.","timestamp_created":1609718328,"timestamp_updated":1609718328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrI2s5fYCcauewAI="}
