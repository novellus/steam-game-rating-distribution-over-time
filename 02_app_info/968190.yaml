      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY (Proposed and being built into the game):<br />\r\
      \n-The goal of the game is to destroy your opponents base which is located on\
      \ the opposite sides of the game map (In general MOBA style)<br />\r\n-Players\
      \ can control between 1-5 main player units and use them to attack their opponents<br\
      \ />\r\n-What makes the game unique is our Strategy system which allows players\
      \ to SPECIFY:<br />\r\na. When their army units are generated (The longer you\
      \ keep them held, the more powerful they get, however you risk having your opponent\
      \ make more leg way into your territory).<br />\r\nb. Where on the map their\
      \ home base is<br />\r\nc. When to release their BEAST unit (Each team has only\
      \ ONE beast. Once used it cannot be used again).<br />\r\n-Using various methods\
      \ and strategies, players must defend their bases while trying to attack and\
      \ destroy their opponents bases.<br />\r\n-Each map varies in both complexity\
      \ and style and landform. Over time many more maps will be added. This style\
      \ of gameplay we are calling DOMINATION MAPS.<br />\r\n-We have an additional\
      \ set of gameplay types proposed as well in the future, including 5v5 third\
      \ person style gameplay<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES (Proposed, however not built\
