It's got cool things, like craters, digging tunnels, and bombers that make your enemies go like the White House from Independence Day, but suffers a bunch from the problem many turn-based games have, where sometimes you get a turn where you have lots and lots of decisions to make, and most of the turns you have no decisions to make at all, and the other player has those things happening on different turns from you.\n\nThe game ended not when I destroyed my friend, but a while after, when the neutral AI faction decided to blow up my base.\n\nAlso sometimes I'd order four tanks to carefully approach a rocket turret simultaneously, and find that two or three of them hung back (out of cowardice?), causing them all to die uselessly.","timestamp_created":1557677830,"timestamp_updated":1557677830,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw96211uoCd5GJwQE="}
