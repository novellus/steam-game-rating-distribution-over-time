    about_the_game: '<strong>Krita</strong> is an open source drawing, painting and
      animation application designed for illustrators, concept artists, comic book
      creators, animators, game artists, matte painters and more. Krita is used daily
      by artists all over the world from professionals, to students, to enthusiastic
      hobbyists.<br><br>Krita offers many features, including industry standards and
      innovative designs, which make painting more fun and productive. There are powerful
      brush engines for sketching and painting, stabilizers for smooth freehand inking,
      assistants for constructing a complex scene, a distraction-free canvas-only
      mode for painting without clutter, multiple types of layers and masks for non-destructive
      editing and, frankly, too many other features to list! You can also exchange
      files with other applications in a variety of different formats.<br><br>Another
      thing that makes Krita truly stand out is that it''s being developed in coordination
      with an international community of open source enthusiasts with the unified
      goal of making a great digital painting application that''s available as widely
      as possible. There are no activation codes or mandatory monthly subscription
      fees, because as members of the digital art community, Krita belongs to all
      of us--to use, to modify, to design, and to share.<br><br>In other words, the
      Krita community is the lifeblood of this project; none of this would have been
      possible without the generous contributions of our users, and together, the
      sky is the limit. Our transparent and collaborative process is empowered thanks
      to the support of our users, and <i>by buying through Steam you will be directly
      supporting Krita''s development.</i><br><br>Buying through Steam also delivers
      the convenience of <i>easy installation</i> on all your supported devices and
      <i>automatic updates</i> each time a new version is released.<br><br>Finally,
      because Krita is a community-driven project you can also download it for free
      from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://krita.org/download/krita-desktop/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >Krita Foundation</a> website. Part of our mission
      is to create a potent tool for artists everywhere, free from most of the socioeconomic
      boundaries typically associated with professional art software. If users cannot
      afford Krita or are still unsure about supporting our work, we encourage them
      to try it out first, supporting us only because you want to. However, you won''t
      have access to the benefit of automatic updates through Steam.<br><br><strong>Have
