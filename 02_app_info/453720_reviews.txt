A fun mix of work and number and pattern puzzles and a good time to be had solving clues together.  Story was a little creepy a little silly but over all fun. Though had some glitches that made us have to restart the chapter a few times, but still would recommend. I'm sad it's over and wish there were more types of puzzles at the last half of the game, but not bad at all.","timestamp_created":1609653922,"timestamp_updated":1609653922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjbW24/YCcYP9vwI="}
