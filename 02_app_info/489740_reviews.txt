Thank you so much, guys!\n\nThis game is just a little experience to play around with, for good-hearted people open to fresh peaceful wonderlands. But what a polished and cute one! I love the fact that it's just a simple thing, with no score, no nothing, just a *game to have fun*.\nIt needs a bit of space (or to tweak your playspace with SteamVR Advanced Settings), but it really goes well with the controllers and head tracking to give you a real VR feeling (once again, a short one).\n\nThanks again to the creators!
