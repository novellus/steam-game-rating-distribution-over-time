Your 1st set up of  this game could take up to 2 hours of work, just based off the amount of time it took me to find the correct fix. But after I got everything to work i was happy. Other people are saying that it wont work with their modern amount of cores, but mine works perfectly after following the steps in the discussion I'll put in the comments. I loved this game to death on Xbox and I'm going to start loving it again. Unfortunately there is no boss rush mode in this version. So the grind will be real. If you loved this game and are willing to put in a little trouble shooting then grab it. Coop is still a thing and 80% of the time I can find other games to play in. As for pvp. It's pretty dead. You will have to coordinate in a group or discord or something to get a pvp match. In my biased opinion it's still an 8/10 game. I am excited to play this again. For $20 and knowing the fix that worked for me I would buy it again.\n\nWIndows 10 x64\nRTX 2070 S\ni7-8700\n32GB RAM\nDX11 mode\n\nP.S. I play with an Xbox 1 controller.
