The story is quite unique and very well put. \nHowever, some of the voice acting doesn't match the text or it has been fast track ahead the text that comes on. It very enjoyable even though of that error. \nI have played it and the achievement do come up in the actual game but steam hasn't recognised that I have earned the achievement, which is a shame. Maybe I'm not hitting the right choice for the achievement but I will experiment and see. \n\nI would like to see more games like this one. Not with the same story of course but with the traditional Japanese character designs. I will like to play it again.","timestamp_created":1564515851,"timestamp_updated":1564515851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r6uaouwCf9O3zwE="}
