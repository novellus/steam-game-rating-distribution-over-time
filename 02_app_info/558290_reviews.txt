Honestly, this one is subjective, though. Some people prefer more calming songs, while others (like me) have a greater preference for a more frenetic experience.\n\nIf you loved J-Punch's 5 songs that are included in the base game, you'll also love this pack too. 3 new songs, and as advertised, soothing and mellow for you to bop along to. This also means that the note charts are far less frantic than the earlier challenge packs - but there is still ample enough challenge for you to hit the patterns accurately, especially if you're a highscorer. For this I have to single out the charting for Make It Blue for particular praise, as it combines triplet patterns with straight beat patterns.\n\nThat's not to say the songs are bad - rather, like all the J-Punch songs that were in the base game, they were [strike]ludicrously[/strike] ridiculously ([i]poor choice of word[/i]) catchy. I still have some snippets of the songs stuck in my head, even now as I type this.\n\nPersonally, I found this to be the first pack where the items are actually the better of the two offerings (of songs versus items). The item that increases the amount of time spent on the lanes, Impatience Overwhelming, is a solid aid to highscorers who want to remain on one lane. The other item that I like, which is named after the winner of the Metronomicon Speedrun Tournament, is a fond memory of the speedrun fun I had during the tournament. \n[url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeTAkesjC3v4NNk8j_3QGJw8lcGa9btso]Playlist of tourney videos here[/url]\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nStill, it's only $2. You can't go wrong getting this if you love the game and want to support the developers, like I do.\n\n[h1][b]9.0/10[/b][/h1]","timestamp_created":1480948111,"timestamp_updated":1481463114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568024992942810059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkaWF99gCc6fLaw=="}
