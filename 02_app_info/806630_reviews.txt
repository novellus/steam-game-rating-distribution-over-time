The novels and storytelling are too good to let talent like this continue to be unrecognized and go to waste. Like most said, the songs are good, but you buy this to support HCP to make more novels, or make the one's they're working on even better. I wish I had known that they were publishing new IP's and were working on an extended edition back in 18/19, as it really does irk me that I could've been supporting these guys two years ago. I can chip in with at least this, though.","timestamp_created":1596676864,"timestamp_updated":1596676864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgO/W4PMCd+7WmQI="}
