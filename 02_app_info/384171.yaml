    review: 'Just like the game it belongs to, this DLC is a parody. This time it
      is making fun of two things: day one downloadable content and the baffling practise
      of spending money on purely cosmetic items. In our case, this translates to
      a (very) silly-looking propeller hat.


      Of course, the real point of this DLC is to donate to the developers using Steam
      itself. So, if you liked The Secret of Tremendous Corporation and feel like
      expressing it with some money (and already purchased the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/384170/]soundtrack[/url]),
      this is an excellent way of doing it.'
