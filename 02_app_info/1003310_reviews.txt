Overgrowth map and idea of unlocking plots by doing challenges was great, first map looked cool, third one isn't bad either. I think this is the point from where they started adding wave based maps/challenges into the game, and they overshoot it a little bit here. It took me 20 in-game years to get 3 stars on last map, 30 total to get the achievement. The ice statue is great object to place in all those warm maps.\nThe new curing rooms look neat.","timestamp_created":1606803785,"timestamp_updated":1606803785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40oC+jvYCc9aftgI="}
