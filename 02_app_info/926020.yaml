    review: '"This special limited time offer"


      BL0CKY_DUDE26/11/2020

      So catalyst is not limited anymore?

      IronHorse(developper)26/11/2020

      I think one person wants it to be, but the rest of us are fighting it and just
      want to ignore turning it off long enough that it falls in with what we''re
      doing from then on , which is no more time limitations


      Ah yes, i love transparency.


      I wish i could upvote this pack. Skins are really nice.

      See you guys in 2023 for the 5th birthday of this limited time offer!'
