While the concept is good, the game is not.\n\nSTORY:\nThere is a zombie apocalypse happening.  You are a survivor.  That's it.  There's no plot to this game.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDesolation is a brawler game.  It is similar to Final Fight, Streets Of Rage, and Rival Turf.  The difference is that you're beating up zombies instead of gangs of street thugs.  You will punch, kick, and jump kick the zombies.  After killing a zombie, you will get some resources.  They are food, wood, metal, and tools.  When you get enough items, you can purchase upgrades to other areas.  Doing this will unlock different characters for you to use.  \n\nPROS:\nDesolation is a simple, beat-em-up game.\n\nCONS: \nYou will go through the same stage over, and over, and over, and over again.  Even if you were to unlock different characters, it doesn't matter.  You will fight the same zombies in front of the same buildings without any change to the game.  I managed to fully upgrade the farm, and one area to the depot.  There were still no changes.  I was at least hoping to see a farmhouse, rows of corn, or a train in the background.  \n\nOVERALL:\nYou can play Desolation: End Of Days for five minutes, and get an overall feel of the game.  I put 90 minutes into it, and that was only to fully upgrade the farm.  It's like the developers got one stage completed and said, \"We're done.  Let's get beer now.\"  I initially enjoyed beating up zombies on the streets.  But we need more than that.  Would it have been difficult to give us a nightclub, a hospital, or a subway tunnel?","timestamp_created":1609380727,"timestamp_updated":1609380727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jaGk2/YCdZz8vgI="}
