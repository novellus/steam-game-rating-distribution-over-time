This is an old route, and it shows. However, old routes are cheap when on sale and have tons of workshop content available for them. One of my only complaints is the blatant false advertising with the screenshots on the store page showing locomotives that are not included with this dlc and are sold separately. I knew that at the time of my purchase, but in case you are reading this and are not familiar with the dirty practices of Train Simulator dlc, here is your warning. The other complaint is really more of a preference. The K4 is the only PRR steam loco that is available for this game, which makes it a bit of a one-off. I wish there were more available instead of the boring diesels. However, if you are going to only include one PRR Steam loco, by all means make it the K4.","timestamp_created":1608790362,"timestamp_updated":1608790362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+ZjYyfYCeJ3YvAI="}
