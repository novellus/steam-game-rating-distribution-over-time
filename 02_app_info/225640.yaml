    review: "I Had thought this 2nd sacred would suck compared to the first one, however\
      \ I have found that I am liking it a lot, although so far I have only played\
      \ the one character the Seraphim, I am already looking forward to trying the\
      \ game out with some of the other characters in the future. \n   I have had\
      \ little to no issue running the game on my machine, I find overall that it\
      \ runs smoothly, almost seamlessly. I have run into very few bugs so far mostly\
      \ concerned with quests, sometimes they seem uncompletable for some reason,\
      \ however all that I have had to do was exit completely and reload.\n    Overall\
      \ very satisfied with how this game runs, the controls, action, visuals, characters\
      \ the whole deal."
