    review: '(THIS REVIEW WAS BEFORE I FOUND OUT I DID THE PUZZLE WRONG)


      This is going to be an honnest review...


      I can''t recomend a game I can''t beat as much as I semi enjoyed it


      Pros:

      - always having creepy stuff every few minutes

      - interactive room

      - audio gives me the shivers

      - not being able to hide from the jump scares


      Cons:

      - sounds are on a loop, and you can constantly hear the cut on them

      - 1 puzzle which you can''t win

      - jump scares are the same exact idea, something latches onto your face, rinse
      and repeat

      - the camera on the screen isn''t matching the Vive, my review video will be
      weird because of it


      I honnestly think the game is broken or not finished though they did say to
      give feedback so they can fix these problems
