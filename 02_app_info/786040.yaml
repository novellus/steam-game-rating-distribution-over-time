    review: "Good fun.... older game with no bells and whistles and no voices. \n\
      Frankly, it's enjoyable to use ones' brain to figure out  how to use and combine\
      \ items to advance in the game. \nThe hogs were not impossible either.  I did\
      \ think it ended a bit abruptly but many things can make this necessary. \n\
      I have most of the hotel games but never got around to them so it will be a\
      \ pleasure to continue in this saga...."
