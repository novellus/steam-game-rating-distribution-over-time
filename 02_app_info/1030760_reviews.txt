It has a lot of potential.... but still needs some serious work.  Combat feels janky and hitboxes are... generously exaggerated for both the player and the enemies.  There also seems to be a bit of lag time between the character hitting an enemy, not to mention the enemies can hit you even if they're not in an \"action\" pose (sprite work?).  \n\nI do love the concept of the game though; a metroidvania style mixed with steampunk.  \n\nSeeing how this game is still in early access, given the current circumstances, I don't know if this is an abandoned game.  Would love to see more.  Wait until there are some major updates before trying.  \n\nCheers.","timestamp_created":1599344025,"timestamp_updated":1599344025,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1599503858,"developer_response":"Thanks for your input. You are playing a concept demo and we are developping the full game as we speak. It will be a full fresh build with an entirely new code and a new store page. Expect lots of improvments in the new build because I am recoding everything based on reviews and players observations. I guess you can say a concept demo is doomed to be always flawed because it is a concept demo and serve the purpose to make a better game. Exactly what is happening. Cheers."}],"cursor":"AoJ42qOVsPQCe9aFoAI="}
