Else very nice implementing of \"Dune\" similar sound elements... and the sudden change :)\n\n\"Void Terror\":\nDamn, the beginn has some similarity with \"Devoured\", nice!\n\n\"Galactiv Winds\":\nReminds me of some old Amiga games and intro soundtracks! EPIC!\n\n\"Final Showdown\":\nPure SciFi-start. All the so long heard SF-Choruses at the beginn of the Track.\nI love the way the siren is implemented in all the Battle tracks.\n\n\nThe whole Soundtrack is very impressiv, as it has many details to other ST and many changes accros a track, seldom heard.\n\nThe soundtrack is on the same league as of \"Total Annihilation\" and \"Supreme Commander\" and \" Golem Gates\" !!!\n\nI must put \"Peter Venne\" on my watchlist! Maybe on Soundcloud ...?\n\nGreat Job Composer and The Trese Brothers to choose it for their game!\n\nI realy recommand the SoundTrack, specially at this price, it is a Steal from an Artist !!! (Sorry Mr. Venne)\n\nEarworms :)","timestamp_created":1598782002,"timestamp_updated":1598783813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42J68n/QCe5DangI="}
