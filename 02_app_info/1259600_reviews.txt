The environments are mysterious and intriguing, and the entire mood that the game sets is very effective.

If you think you'd like this, then it's absolutely worth checking out.","timestamp_created":1608963697,"timestamp_updated":1608963697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lrXtzvYCccOlvQI="}
