But there are big flaws, more precisely the walking speed of the main character and the atrocious inventory make this an exercice in patience.\nThankfully the game is not very long and you can soldier through it and finish it.\nI know the whole game is second degree and the horrid gameplay is probably part of the experience, but it's really a slog to play.\n\nThe game itself is OK. It's a point-and-click adventure.\n Its main selling point, the 1994 look, which is coherent and well done. It looks like all these sleazy 3D renderings must have required a bit of time to create.\nIt really feels like a cheap softcore game that you'd play at this time and the poser/3DS renderings are very faithful to the era. As well as the general alien theme that reminds of the X-file craze, and the douche characters straight out of a cheap 1990s softcore movie.\nIt would have been great if the musics had been similar to the smooth MIDI jazz backgrounds you could hear in those old 90s porn movies, which is a lost art in itself.\nThe sex scenes are exactly what you'd expect to find on a risque CD-rom exploiting the latest 1994 tech. More horrifying than arousing.\nThe game can be finished and you wont find yourself stumped because you forgot something or because of a logical bug.\n\nMost of the cutscenes are displayed slowly and with choppy sound and I'm not sure if it's part of the 1994 experience or just because the engine is really shitty.\n\nI'm going to give this a thumb up because of the overall coherence and design, but I really hope the devs adress these problem if they make another game. Right now I'd advise to wait for a sale if you want to buy it. Don't pay more than a couple dollers for it tbqh.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1570598315,"timestamp_updated":1570600687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ZLG1+0CcKPl0wE="}
