It is rather linear as far as gameplay is concerned (not an open world), but there are plenty of boss battles/combat and puzzles mixed with it that have you progress through the game to make it interesting. I would recommend this game to be played with a controller given it's multiple controls for special combo attacks and various secondary attacks, but that could be personal preference anyway - to each their own! Otherwise, love the game!","timestamp_created":1610041743,"timestamp_updated":1610041743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46er97vYCeZiqwQI="}
