      /><br>Have you ever wondered what it feels to be a ghostly being?<br><br>You
      have always lived happily in your mansion. A mansion that you managed to obtain
      with a lot of hard work and many personal sacrifices. Naturally you don''t want
      anyone else to take care of it, not even in death! But now, after your demise,
      many tenants have taken over it, and this is intolerable to you. <br>Luckily,
      your love for your manor has granted you powers that will help you get rid of
      those pesky individuals. <br><br>Watch them run and scream, scaring them using
      your intelligence, wit, and with the use of powers like possessions, spectres,
      altering objects and more.<br>Have fun and play with the occult... and become
      a Poltergeist! <br><br>Poltergeist: A Pixelated Horror is a puzzle game for
      PC/Mac/Linux, in which you are a ghost named Henry B. Knight. You will scare
      the tenants currently living in your house, so you can have some peace at last
      in the afterlife.'

      Watch them run and scream, scaring them using your intelligence, wit, and with
      the use of powers like possessions, spectres, altering objects and more. Have
      fun and play with the occult... and become a Poltergeist!
