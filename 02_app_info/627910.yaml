    review: '[h1]This game''s the best Bubsy''s ever been in. While that''s not exactly
      high praise, it''s a perfectly acceptable 2D platformer in its own right if
      you buy it for less than $5.00.


      It''s very short, so I strongly recommend against paying more.[/h1]


      As platformers go, ''The Woolies Strike Back'' is definitely on the fairer side.
      It wasn''t difficult to beat each level with all collectibles in one go until
      the end, and outside of a difficulty spike with the second (surprisingly engaging)
      boss fight, difficulty is ramped smoothly throughout the game.


      [h1]Levels are designed to use your moveset to its full potential, and it leads
      to some fun little tricks you need to pull off to get all t-shirts.


      Not all of these are intuitive, so here are some pointers:[/h1]


      You jump like in any other platformer, by pressing the "A" button. If you hold
      the "Y" button, you do a double-jump. That double-jump ends in a glide if you
      continue holding the "Y" button.


      [b]If you walk off of a ledge, however, that does not count as a jump.[/b]


      This means you can jump mid-air during your fall, [b][i]and[/i][/b] press the
      "Y" button to double-jump into a glide. This also works when you move Bubsy
      off of a climbable wall he''s clung to using the directional buttons instead
      of jumping off of it, which you might be tempted to do from other 2D platformers.


      Knowing this is essential to obtaining some collectibles that require [b]hooking
      yourself under walls[/b] and around to climbable surfaces on the other side.
      It makes for a fun little challenge, and Black Forest Games leans on tricks
      like this throughout the game.


      [b]Additionally, there''s now a pounce ability that sends you leaping into enemies
      in a forwards arc.[/b] The most important thing to know about this ability is
      that, after hitting any enemy with the pounce, you will be launched straight
      up. [b][i]Each enemy you collide with during this upwards launch will trigger
      another launch[/i][/b], and some t-shirts are placed in ways that require taking
      advantage of this.


      [h1]Overall this is a simple, honest platformer. No surprises here, and nothing
      new, but it''s fully functional and doesn''t overstay its welcome.


      It''s on-par with its budget platformer roots, and so it''s hard to walk away
      disappointed.[/h1]'
