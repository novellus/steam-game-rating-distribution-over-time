    reviews: "\u201CThe graphics and puzzles in particular have been improved significantly\u2026\
      \ the overall product is wholly satisfying. If you\u2019re looking for light\

      \ dollar.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.justadventure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=692%20-%20Add%20NoFollow\"\

      \ game is quite fun to play. The story is interesting and fairly long, and the\
      \ puzzles are engaging. Young sleuths will keep playing to the end to find out\
      \ the culprit.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/nancy_drew_legend_of_the_crystal_skull_pc_review\"\

      \ problems in saying this is the best game in the series that I\u2019ve played,\
      \ and I have played a lot of them. The upgrades to the character models are\
      \ now a match for the excellent voice work and sharp dialogue that has always\
      \ characterized the series, and is continued in Legend of Crystal Skull.\u201D\
