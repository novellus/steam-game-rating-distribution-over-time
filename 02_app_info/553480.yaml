    review: "pretty interesting choose your own adventure novel/game. It has a ok\
      \ start, a really solid middle, and a very confusing end.\n\nPlayed four hours\
      \ and got a single ending, went back one choice and got a different ending.\
      \ Yet how I got to these two different endings was unnerving. The middle was\
      \ fine since I could follow along with the story, yet I think my choices screwed\
      \ up the order near the end. I just jumped to doing some trial thing and beat\
      \ the game. It was weird. How the heck did I even get there. There was a single\
      \ scene about a random X on the map, and boom I'm at a library, then boom I'm\
      \ trapped, I escape, and couple choices later it ends... I was like ok... That\
      \ felt Super forced! like no build up or ready for the climax kinda thing. \n\
      \nAll in all I thought it was very well done, even the voice acting. Though\
      \ if you play I recommend going into settings and dropping the SFX and Music\
      \ a bit, then turn up the TV/Monitor volume. the voices in some scenes are quiet,\
      \ VERY quiet.\n\nI would like a scroll back function with the mouse wheel. sometimes\
      \ I click to fast and skip a piece of dialogue.\n\nI do think some characters\
      \ are a bit much. Like what is up with that choice in the beginning. \"I'm giving\
      \ you a direct order\" ahhhh Dude I had what three scenes with you and you start\
      \ ordering me around? I know there has to be something to give the characters\
      \ a \"choices matter\" kinda feeling, just what the hell man. I have known the\
      \ guy for five minutes and he starts ordering me around? Yes I had to iterate\
      \ this scene twice since it was SO forced!\n\nAs far as Visual novels go, its\
      \ pretty decent. Definitely not the best I have seen, yet every one has their\
      \ own idea's on what is the best. I thought it was pretty good, just the choices\
      \ feel kinda put in weird spots and the choices some times are way off the marker\
      \ in what you think you want your character to say.\n\nSo first ending I got\
      \ was one queen to rule them all.... or that's the feeling I get. Changing one\
      \ choice at the end got me let have a for the people ending and talk things\
      \ out. which in my book didn't end well. LOL I think the princess maker type\
      \ games do a bit better in that regards to being an epilogue on your choices.\n\
      \nall in all I say decent. :)"
