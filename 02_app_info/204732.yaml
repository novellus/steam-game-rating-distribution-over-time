    review: This DLC suffers the same problems as it's base game.On the surface it
      looks interesting but when you get into it there isn't much there. It's a character
      in, a game with many characters and a max party size of 3. He's pretty good
      but he's certainly not a game changer. In the end you're paying almost four
      dollars to get a medic class that comes with his level cap unlocked. That's
      certainly helpful but by no means worth the cost. If you're a diehard Krater
      player and want a little variety or need a little something more in your medic
      slot then wait for a sale and pick him up on the cheap.
