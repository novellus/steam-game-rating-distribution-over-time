I would not characterize it as inane because it is one cut better than that, but just barely.\n\nIt's hard to tell when you should click to advance the dialogue.  If you do you might miss something, but that's probably not a bad thing.\n\nI wasn't expecting the game to be about finding hidden objects, but it is.  I encountered three puzzles, none of them giving hints as to what I was supposed to do.  That wasn't a problem on the first puzzle (an uninspired cypher solving puzzle), but the next two were hidden object finders, after which I threw in the towel in disgust.\n\nThere are several YouTube walkthroughs that I should have looked at before buying the game, because I would have realized what I was getting myself into.\n\nA shame, because medieval alchemy is a great subject.","timestamp_created":1507136516,"timestamp_updated":1507136516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632004439830780029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+sWV9N4Cf6yqhwE="}
