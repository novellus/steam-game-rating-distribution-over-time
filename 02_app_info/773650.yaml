    about_the_game: "In 1687, Isaac Newton published the law of universal gravitation\
      \ in the mathematical principle of natural philosophy.<br />\r\nLater, Isaac\
      \ Newton on why planets revolve around the sun, because of God, is also thinking\
      \ about the origin of the universe, that in addition to the effect of gravitation,\
      \ and a tangential force, the tangential force is only the first driving force\
      \ from god.<br />\r\nNow, you are God, and you bring the first thrust of God.<br\
      \ />\r\nWe used advanced AI system, combined with Newton's law of gravitation,\
      \ recorded the location of objects in real time, and gave these big data to\
      \ AI for deep learning, so as to calculate the real-time orbit of objects. All\
      \ of this has been fully optimized, fluent and accurate.<br />\r\nThe game screen\
      \ is very delicate, with majestic atmosphere of music, make you immersed.<br\
      \ />\r\nYou need to control your aircraft and collect two boxes in the game.\
      \ You need to judge the magnitude of gravity, through the transmission of the\
      \ orbit. Finally landing on the designated platform, remember that you can't\
      \ land faster than the maximum landing speed of the aircraft. Here, we hope\
      \ that you can learn the relevant knowledge of gravity, so that you can better\
      \ pass the customs. Remember, the magnitude of gravity is directly proportional\
      \ to the speed and the range of the gravitational body, and we create a unique\
      \ console operation mode that allows you to control the aircraft more truly.\
      \ In the game, you can see it at a glance.<br />\r\nWe will continue to update\
      \ the new level, let everyone have a good time, and hope that you can love physics\
      \ and understand the astrodynamics, and become an excellent scientist."
