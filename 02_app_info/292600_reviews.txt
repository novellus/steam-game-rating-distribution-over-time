The mechanics are fun and incresingly challenging, learning curve is adequate, music/sound is wonderful and so are the minimalistic graphics. It's a relaxing yet fun experience.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a mobile port, though. It's relatively simple and it's designed to be played with 2 fingers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's been a few years and it's still entertaining to get in and play a daily challenge every now and then. Like, considering the type of arcade simple game that it is, the gameplay loop is surprisingly amusing and the game overall feels polished and smooth.","timestamp_created":1561917696,"timestamp_updated":1606375920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmOrdgfYCfbGqyAE="}
