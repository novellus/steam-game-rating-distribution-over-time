    review: "There is very little to no plot here, this is just riddles and fights.\
      \ Be sure to think up your own backstory if you want to run this. I wouldn't\
      \ complain if it was free, but it wasn't... so you'll still need to work on\
      \ this a bit even if you're paying for the convenience. I would also have liked\
      \ the riddles to be a little more obscure than using several from The Hobbit.\
      \ I've had to make some adjustments in that department as well. \n\nThat said,\
      \ the design of it is okay, even though there really doesn't seem to be much\
      \ explanation or reason for some of the magical items being there an accessed\
      \ in the way they are."
