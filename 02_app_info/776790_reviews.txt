It's a pretty simple, relatively short game, but it does a better job capturing the spirit of the first couple of Super Monkey Ball than the modern Super Monkey Ball games, like Banana Blitz (Note: Super Monkey Ball Retro or whatever the final name will be was not released at the time that I am reviewing this game). The stage designs are simple, but challenging and rely on precise movements and timing. The whole system of coins that unlock squirrel and ball accessories is really novel and adds to the game. The mini games are also tons of fun. Overall, I'd say the game is definitely worth giving a shot for fans of the genre.","timestamp_created":1597342782,"timestamp_updated":1597342782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo5LD9PMCc7qgmwI="}
