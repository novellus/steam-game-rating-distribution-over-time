    about_the_game: 'OrbusVR: Reborn is a ground-up rework of OrbusVR, which was originally
      released into Early Access December 2017. OrbusVR is the only MMORPG designed
      exclusively for room-scale virtual reality. It features everything you love
      about an MMO: a huge open world, over a hundred hours of quests following an
      intriguing story, interesting lore and characters, dragon pets, five-player
      group dungeons, world bosses, voice chat, player trading, fishing and crafting,
      and more! Plus you''ll be part of a world brimming with thousands of other players.<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> 100+ hours of content, including new weekly missions in addition
      to Main Story quests<br></li><li> 8 unique classes: Ranger, Musketeer, Warrior,
      Runemage, Shaman, Paladin, Bard and Scoundrel<br></li><li> NEW dynamic scaling
      system, allowing veteran and new players to quest together<br></li><li> 4 major
      five-person dungeons, each with unique enemies and bosses with interesting mechanics<br></li><li>
      Improved monster AI for more challenging combat<br></li><li> Revamped open world
      PvP and NEW Battlegrounds<br></li><li> In-game voice chat, dungeon finder, fellowships,
      private messaging, and other socialization features to keep you connected to
      the world<br></li><li> Dedicated collaborative development process with a hands-on
      development team that cares about your feedback<br></li><li> Dragon pets, cosmetic
      capes, achievements, and much more!</li></ul><br><strong>Try Before You Buy</strong><br><br>The
      OrbusVR Demo will allow you to create a character and play for free until Level
      10 on all eight classes. Once you''ve decided to purchase the game, you''ll
      be able to start right where you left off with the demo restrictions removed
      so you can continue your journey! (Note that demo accounts cannot trade with
      other players or use the Auction House in-game).<br><br><strong>Buy Once, Play
      Forever</strong><br>OrbusVR does not have a required monthly subscription fee!
      Once you''ve bought the game, you are able to play it as much as you''d like
      without paying us another dime. We don''t have any &quot;Pay 2 Win&quot; in-app
      purchases or loot boxes, either. Ongoing revenue is provided via an in-game
      cosmetic with items such as mounts and cosmetic pets for sale. Our ongoing business
      strategy is to release yearly expansion packs that will cost an additional fee
      to unlock that new content, similar to other &quot;Buy to Play&quot; MMOs.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The
      combat of OrbusVR has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of
      room-scale VR. That means instead of just mashing buttons on an ability bar,
      you actually have to hone your physical skill to become more effective at combat.<br><br>For
      example, there''s no tab-targetting for Rangers, who have to actually aim and
      hit targets with their bow. And for the Runemage, your ablity to cast spells
      is determined by how quickly and precisely you can draw the ancient symbols
      of runespeak. Whether you''re looking for an up-close-and-personal, physically
      demanding melee role, or a more planned-out approach to combat via the musketeer''s
      orbs, you''ll find that combat in OrbusVR is unlike any other MMO you''ve ever
      played.<br><br><strong>Relax</strong><br>When you''re ready to put down your
      sword for the day, you''ve got some great options available to kick back and
      relax. Fishing is a great way to pass the time and earn a little dram while
      you''re at it. Just pull up a chair and see what fish are biting at Kingsport
      Lake. Maybe you''ll break your record?<br><br>When you finish with that, you
      can enjoy your own personal Player House, where you can craft potions and age
      them in your cellar, patiently waiting for the right moment to use (or sell)
      them. Finally, be sure to spend some time enjoying the company of your pet dragon,
      who''s always interested in what treats you might have for them to munch on.<br><br><strong>VR
      Support From the Beginning</strong><br><br>OrbusVR has been designed from the
      ground-up for desktop VR systems. As such we have full support for 180-degree
      (front facing) and 360-degree tracking setups. We''ve also got all kinds of
      great options for locomotion, including Teleport and Sliding, as well as the
      ability to customize your forward direction, smooth and snap turning, and even
      dual-joystick support for strafe/move and turn at the same time!<br><br>Note
      that for the absolute best experience, we do recommend a 360-degree tracking
      setup.'
