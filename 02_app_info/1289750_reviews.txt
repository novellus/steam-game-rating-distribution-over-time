The developer is actively engaged with the player community discussing features and improvements to the game experience. Fans of roguelikes, physics engines, and space faring rats should give this charming title a try. \n\nOperation Zeta is a unique take on the roguelike genre. There are no bosses or deadly combat to end your run, but rather a strict time limit.\n\nPlaying Operation Zeta throws the player in to a crisis. You are a sole survivor of a failed mission. The enemy is closing in on you. You have minutes to find the pieces of your ship and repair them to escape. Your ship parts are rarely just lying around having been gathered by locals who will need help before giving them back. Sometimes these quests are simple, bring me 5 stones a cat might say. Sometimes they are more complicated, requiring you to explore the map and find special items spread throughout. These items and denizens are spread across numerous planets that you must travel between to complete your goal. \n\nThis is where things begin to get interesting. Like I stated above, Operation Zeta gives you minutes to explore the map, collect ship parts which means complete quests, return parts to your ship, and repair the whole thing. If that sounds like a lot, it is. The challenge of this game is not the combat, but the pressure of the time limit. Finding ways to save time as you explore become immensely rewarding. \n\nTake the Roki, a species of space faring rats. They are innately better at repairing ships than any other species. Since they have tools to repair faster, you can start building your foundation or repair kits as you complete the other tasks. If this sounds like they completely bypass the repair stage, they do. This doesnâ€™t feel unfair though because their combat is slow and deadly. Each planet has gravity which causes shots to arc around the planet in some strange orbit. This mechanic makes fighting with most races relatively safe since you can get some range on enemies using the gravitational pull to curve your bullets. The Roki however, shoot projectiles that are too fast and escape the gravity of your planet. So every fight is a grueling game of cat and space rat.\n\n As an early access, indie title, Operation Zeta is a fun little puzzle to solve. There are areas for the game to grow for sure. I could discuss issues such as the lack of variety in quests or inability to leave a puzzle once you start it. However, by the time you are reading this they are likely to be addressed by the developer. Opening the main screen of Operation Zeta gives a countdown to the next update release. This is not to say that both issues I mentioned above will be resolved with the next update, but it shows that the developer is committed to making this game great. The studio hosts an active discord page that you can use to discuss the game and suggest features with the developer and other players. \n\nTo wrap this up, I do recommend you give this title a try. The game is charming and quick. The community and developer are active and growing. Lastly, a successful run will take less than 15 minutes, but you will find yourself playing for a few hours before you get there.  \n","timestamp_created":1598402509,"timestamp_updated":1598402509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNeNlPQCeqvknQI="}
