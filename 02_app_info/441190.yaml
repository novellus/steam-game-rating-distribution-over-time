    review: "This movie has a Horror tag?\n \nHere's a more accurate movie bio:\n\n\
      Simon is a dedicated teacher, but he has a boring secret - Beneath the surface,\
      \ he is a kind, reluctant man with a blood sucking fetish.\n\nHe doesn't have\
      \ any of the normal vampire characteristics sadly.  He is just a normal nice\
      \ guy who likes to drink women's blood.  I couldn't figure out if he needed\
      \ to drink blood for his anemia, or if it was just some type of fetish.  Making\
      \ the movie about his homicidal blood drinking friend would have been more interesting.\n\
      \nVery slow and no fright factor as far as I could tell.  I don't recommend."
