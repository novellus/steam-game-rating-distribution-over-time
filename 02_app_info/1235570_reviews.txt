I think it's a big disadvantage to have too few missions compared to the price range, but if you play on the premise of mini games, it's a fun and not bad game. \nOf course, even if you press the R key, sometimes you can't reload the bullet, or the aiming is a little weird, or the enemy's physical strength seems too much, but I think it's not a big problem. In fact, I was thinking about getting a refund because it was less than two hours after I played this game, but I decided not to refund the game because I didn't know whether there would be more missions in the future or things would improve in many ways. Therefore, I expect producers to show new changes with updates that are better enough not to disappoint relative to the price range.","timestamp_created":1592892135,"timestamp_updated":1592892135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604601025581359863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45aLx7/ICeJnSjwI="}
