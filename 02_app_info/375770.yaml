    about_the_game: "Within a galaxy of terraformed planets, a secret war rages between\
      \ two intergalactic agencies. One of them\u2014ARCHON\u2014is developing the\
      \ technology to invade people\u2019s minds. They have already tyrannized a planet\
      \ called Teballai, and hope to use their mind-reading technology to spread their\
      \ power across the galaxy. A second organization\u2014FOE (Freedom Organization\
      \ of Elites)\u2014wants to destroy ARCHON\u2019s technology in the name of freedom.\
      \ When a young FOE soldier (you choose the gender) named Blaire obtains the\
      \ ability to read minds from an ARCHON experiment, she finds her loyalty torn\
      \ between both sides. Whether Blaire helps the enemy or defeats them depends\
      \ upon your use of her power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the hallmarks of the\
      \ traditional visual novel is a branching story line. This is typically accomplished\
      \ via choices forced on the player. In some of the most complex visual novels,\
      \ there are dozens of these choices and multiple endings. I call Quantum Conscience\
      \ &quot;experimental&quot; because it seeks to do away with these choices. Outside\
      \ of the very first few minutes of the game, in which the player chooses to\
      \ be a male or female protagonist and answers some questions about their background,\
      \ there are no forced choices. Rather, the player character--a soldier in the\
      \ far-flung future--is given the power to, at any time, read the minds of the\
      \ other characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow often Blaire, your protagonist, uses\
      \ this power is entirely up to the player. Starting from the middle of chapter\
      \ one, it is almost always available, and the only way the player interacts\
      \ with the story. The consequences of the knowledge Blaire gains (or doesn't)\
      \ changes how Blaire acts and how other characters react to Blaire."

    short_description: In this unconventional visual novel, the player controls the
      story by choosing whether to use the main character's ability to read people's
      minds. As an agent of an intergalactic society of freedom fighters, Blaire's
      telepathic skills can be used in the name of freedom, or to manipulate others
      for power.

    review: "Absolutely loved the mind reading mechanic.  But whether to read or not\
      \ read someone's mind is the only choice you have to make outside of exactly\
      \ one other choice about 80% through. \n\nI didn't find the romantic options\
      \ very satisfying but, eh. Had a good time, don't regret the small amount of\
