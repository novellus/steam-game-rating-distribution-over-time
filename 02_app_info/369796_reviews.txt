I'm not sure that it's 100% accurate, but it's close. Guitar is not capable of the same kind of sustain as a sax, so that's a problem. I like it, but some riffs feel unnatural - not native to the guitar - and will be difficult to memorize. Still they are goods riffs to spice up your blues and Latin rock vocabulary. The alternate lead part is challenging, too, and follows somewhat the palm muted lead guitar part on the original, acting as sort of counterpoint to the sax. The tune uses a couple of relatively unusual chords jazz chords. I just got it a few days ago, and it's now a favorite.","timestamp_created":1559588435,"timestamp_updated":1559588435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w96tj+sCd+LXwgE="}
