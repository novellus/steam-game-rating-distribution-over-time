    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      [i] Note for Oculus users on Windows 10: you have to do a Win 7 compatibility\
      \ fix to get your Touch controllers to work correctly. If you don't do Win 7\
      \ fix, then your movement will not work correctly. [/i]\n\nSo first of all,\
      \ I'm pretty confident this game is abandonware, E.A. Early Access often really\
      \ means Early Abandonment. I can't really blame devs though because the VR market\
      \ is so tough. Most devs won't make the profits they are dreaming about. So\
      \ some release a game on E.A. with the best of intentions, only to see very\
      \ few sales. So the motivation to keep improving the game just dries up as hard\
      \ reality hits the developer. You can't continue working on a game where you\
      \ aren't making any money (the hours put it versus the money coming in just\
      \ isn't feasible). Steam really needs to fix E.A. because this happens all too\
      \ often. There needs to be a carrot and a stick so that devs don't just use\
      \ E.A. to release unfinished games and test out the market to see if further\
      \ development is warranted.\n\nAnyways, I finished the game in 48 minutes. This\
      \ game was released August 31, 2017 and well, is still just as unfinished as\
      \ the day it was released. So many features coming that never came. You're basically\
      \ buying a tutorial with 1 level to complete. Everything else was never made.\
      \ There is fulll locomotion (turning is odd because it's done by location of\
      \ motion controllers + head tracking seems to effect it as well). There is a\
      \ comfort mode vignette that you can't turn off when you move. It's not as bad\
      \ as the negative reviewers would have you believe.\n\nIt's a nice tutorial\
      \ and 1 level if you can forgive what it isn't. The graphics look good. You\
      \ can hide in the bushes. You can grab and backstab orc enemies. You can even\
      \ go toe to toe with 1 or 2 orcs out in the open. You can break street lamps\
      \ (who knew Orcs needed so much lighting!). You can throw tinder at explosives\
      \ just laying around a group of Orcs (how convenient). You get to find keys\
      \ out in the open to release human prisoners. \n\nOkay, so the game isn't great,\
      \ but it's not bad either. You can see the potential. Just some more stealth\
      \ mechanics, such as climbing up trees or towers (to plunge down on your enemies).\
      \ A rock to distract them. Maybe a bow & arrow or some smoke clouds. This could\
      \ have been an awesome game.\n\nBut we'll never know. I paid $4 and I think\
      \ I got $4 of content at 48 minutes to finish a game that's mostly a tutorial.\
      \ They were just really set pieces where you have to assasinate Orcs and/or\
      \ release prisoners. The tutorial would have been good for a full game. But\
      \ because game has been abandoned, I can't recommend it. It's a negative / nuetral\
      \ recommendation. Buy at your own risk.\n\nRate 4.5/10. I can't give a positive,\
      \ but it's not that bad actually. May be worth the sale price of $4 for some\
      \ as long as you realize it's been abandoned. What could have been ... dev you\
      \ had a good game .... should have worked more on it before releasing and you\
      \ would have made more money"
