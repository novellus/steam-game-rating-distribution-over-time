However, after revisiting it nearly a year and a half later, I've actually come to appreciate it far more. I think the main issues are the somewhat disappointing ending, and the game as a whole not being as good as the original. Everything else was actually pretty good. The author has made plenty of other great games, so I'm sure the sequel to this one will be better.","timestamp_created":1559287529,"timestamp_updated":1559287529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44u+xhusCf7C3wgE="}
