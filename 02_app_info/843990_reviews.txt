I like the music, the visuals are fun... plenty of shooting, plenty of bullets.. but to be honest it feels a little sloppy and more like something you'd play when you were bored, rather than something you'd play because you wanted to play it. \n\nI might re-install and play again someday just for fun, but this will never be a game I just play all the time.\n\nIssues:\n*You have to keep clicking to keep firing. I don't know.. most bullet hell games, you just hold down that left mouse button and blaze away.\n*Hard to see... with the backgrounds, with all that's going on, sometimes my eyes lose track of what's where.\n*No real sense of achievement... I die, restart, die, restart.. whee\n\nFun stuff:\n*I love all the neon stuff\n*Music is energized and fun\n\nWouldn't really recommend unless you're bored though","timestamp_created":1609009759,"timestamp_updated":1609009759,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4sZCd0PYCdfa9vQI="}
