Today we’ll be looking at the DLC “Maelstrom of Carnage” which retails for $3 currently and brings a single new mission type and doesn’t seem to be much else.  So, is it worth the cost?\n\nSisters of Bombardment:  This DLC seems to only provide one single mission but at least is is repeatable.  Well, I say that but I’ve little desire to repeat it beyond the few times I’ve done it as of yet.  Simply put you wade through hordes of daemons and mutants and every several seconds a bombardment is launched centered on you.  This does a lot of damage to the horde and you get more points for killing stuff.  After the final bombardment you are teleported out and get a final score…that’s it.\n\nSo, worth it?  At full price, no.  Even at discount I’d really only grab it for completion sake or in a bundle but it really doesn’t seem to provide much else.  Am I missing something?  Please let me know.  As always, enjoy!\n","timestamp_created":1590294607,"timestamp_updated":1590294607,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494486391544342041","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yb68ovICdr3ziQI="}
