    review: "Treat this as a neutral review.\n\nWell, this plays at least okay as\
      \ a tactical JRPG (well, they're all tactical aren't they?) but what I mean\
      \ is there is zero emphasis on story. Most of the dialogue is either generic\
      \ or downright sloppy. 9 hours in I don't think it's going to turn into anything\
      \ particularly interesting. I think that someone who is okay with slogging through\
      \ tons of fights might find this enjoyable. It's a bit too much for me though\
      \ but I don't play these kinds of games on the regular anyway.\n\nThe difficulty\
      \ was fairly tough (remember to always buy all the new gear that's available)\
      \ but I think if I had been using the optimal party composition, it could have\
      \ made it too easy on the other hand. Instead I was leveling up all the seven\
      \ party members evenly. There is at least a good deal of variety between their\
      \ attacks. Also the world is painstakingly populated with what may or may not\
      \ be stock assets. Like I said I don't play these kinds of games often and I\
      \ don't exactly know what comes with the program (RPG Maker). It uses several\
      \ useful plug-ins such as the ability to fast forward in battles but I wouldn't\
      \ call its UI quite perfect\u2014it's tough to make really good JRPG, as it\
      \ turns out!\n\nI think there's currently a bug that prevents the shock condition\
      \ (and another one) from ever ending in fights, and I think that's what keeps\
      \ stopping various attacks from going off, which is really annoying. Anyway,\
      \ this could be better... or worse."
