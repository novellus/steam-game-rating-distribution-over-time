    review: Wow. This game is resonating with me in a way I've never quite experienced.
      It's sad and dreamlike and emotionally challenging right from the start. I'll
      update this review, but so far I'm taking my time with this one. The sensation
      of being immersed in someone else's world, someone else's headspace, is stunning.
      If you've never been a fan of visual novels, I think this would be an excellent
      starting point.
