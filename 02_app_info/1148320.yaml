    about_the_game: 'Warp into a busy galaxy with nothing but your wits and a tiny
      ship. Explore sectors, mine asteroids, take on faction missions, sell resources
      and upgrade your loadout. Earn the respect of a faction to unlock new weapons
      and ships. Attack other ships and steal their resources but beware: factions
      won''t tolerate hostility for long without retaliation. Masteroid is an atmospheric,
      indie 2D space game with procedurally-generated sectors and casual, relaxed
      gameplay.<br><br>Key Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Procedurally
      Generated Game World</strong>: Masteroid randomly generates up to six sectors
      for two unique factions at the start of every game so every new game is unique.<br></li><li><strong>Upgrade
      Your Ship</strong>: Every ship you see in space can be purchased and outfitted,
      provided you have the faction reputation!<br></li><li><strong>Upgrade Your Weapons</strong>:
      Ships have one or more turrets. Buy and equip weapons but make sure your ship
      has the energy to fire them!<br></li><li><strong>Relaxed Gameplay</strong>:
      No permadeath here. Death results in a loss of any cargo and a small cash penalty.
      You can play the game as passively or aggressively as you like.<br></li><li><strong>Faction
      Reputation</strong>: Sell mined resources, kill enemy ships or run missions
      to earn reputation points for a faction. Higher levels unlock better weapons
      and ships.</li></ul>'
