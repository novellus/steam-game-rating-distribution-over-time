I use it as a serious tool in photo collage.  Overall, I like it quite well.  Most of the other art software I use have user set function keys ... f3 allows me to bring in additional photos.  A bit distracting when \"out of habit\" I blindly punch f3 and then have to recover from the mess I made.  Would be nice to have other shapes, such as stars, ovals, rectangles, et al.  I export to another program for text but think a text option with base features of shadow, bevel, and so on could make this a stand alone program for some applications for me.  Overall however, it is a mainstay in my resources.","timestamp_created":1579804937,"timestamp_updated":1579804937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ssnt6e8Cf/zN7QE="}
