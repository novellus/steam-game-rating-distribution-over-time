Buggy on release, with incomplete / incoherent storylines and little in the way of new gameplay. Essentially just additional scenarios for the main game. \n\nBuy if you are a big fan or a completist, but the obvious lack of care 11bit put into the game after its release is a shame.","timestamp_created":1539302327,"timestamp_updated":1608236500,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503399848937988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrCXufYCfLbCrAE="}
