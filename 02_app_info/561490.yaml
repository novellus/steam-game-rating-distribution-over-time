    review: I will change this once I recieve a response with a resolution from the
      developer. This software is unusable and generates an error code. A quick Google
      search shows this has been an issue with multiple headsets for over a year.
      I have an Oculus however apparently this is also an issue with Vive. Do not
      waste your time.
