    review: 'Take this more as an average sideways thumb review. I liked the original
      so this seemed like a no-brainer purchase at some point. The art, animations,
      gameplay depth and units are all expanded with lots of new combos and play styles.
      Much higher quality overall for this sequel. The story is along the same lines,
      I skipped most of it as it became a bit time consuming when I wanted to just
      jump into the game.


      So the reason for the average review? I''m not sure why, but the flow or the
      something is just off. Not sure if this is down to balancing or just my preference
      on the original (maybe it''s just nostalgia) or the way the units were slowly
      drip fed through the campaign. Rarely would there be a game where it was a good
      back and forth battle with higher units coming into play. There''s certainly
      a lot more depth for tactics, but often just doing a quick rush brought on the
      win. I did like the side battles where you are forced to choose a select number
      of units to play with (which suit your style), but finishing the campaign actually
      ended up feeling like a grind to me.


      Don''t buy it for multiplayer. It''s completely dead. I couldn''t match a single
      person for a game, which is probably not too surprising given the age of the
      game and I''m guessing a low amount of reviews indicate a very small amount
      of buyers for this one. Unless you''ve got friends who also have a copy, then
      matching them up seems straight forward.'
