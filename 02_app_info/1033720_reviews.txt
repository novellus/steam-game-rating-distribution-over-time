The store page makes it seem like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, but there's literally only the settings button and the advance button. . .\n\nYou can skim through the whole game in less than a few minutes, and the story is so bland and unrealistic, it's not even worth it to read. Who is cured of 'MaJoR dEpReSsIoN' in a conversation that would realistically only last ten minutes??\n\nPlayed for three minutes and realized how ascinine the game-play was. Would not recommend unless you were looking for an awfully boring book to read.\n\n1/10\n\n\n\n\nAlso why is this tagged with Villain Protagonist????","timestamp_created":1561571231,"timestamp_updated":1561571231,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609870970249176025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40cC5yusCfYOuxAE="}
