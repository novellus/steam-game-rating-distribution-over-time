Unfortunately, sword-wielders aren't good in Estellium Legends, so that's also pretty much a wash. This one comes with three \"win any fight instantly\" buttons, but you really shouldn't need five of them. I didn't really see the need for any, myself.\n\nAs an upside, the ero-pictures are much better-drawn than they were in the first Boom Pow Pack, but spending $4 on two lewd pictures and a naked character profile doesn't seem like a great idea to me, I didn't use the Doom Blasters, and the catboy is neither useful nor that unique. Can't recommend this one.","timestamp_created":1600810782,"timestamp_updated":1600810782,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550297737121582031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw08Hw2/QCeKm4owI="}
