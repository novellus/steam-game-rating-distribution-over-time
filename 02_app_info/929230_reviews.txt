It's a VR FPS on an island full of velociraptors.  You're dropped into a facility with various screens that serves as the mission select area.  You pick a mission (and time of day, night missions are great) and you're whisked away to complete an objective ranging from collecting items and finding an escape route to holding down an area for reinforcements, all while fighting off velociraptors.  Overall it's kind of simplistic; sound, textures and AI are all just alright.  In the end it's a fun experience, it's inexpensive and I love dinosaurs so it a thumbs up from me.","timestamp_created":1543564152,"timestamp_updated":1595994087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637442350387573242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45aOqzPMCcvaItAE="}
