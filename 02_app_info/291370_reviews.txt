Was aware of the negative reviews. Been wanting this since 2014 PAX West where I first played it. I was addicted then, and after nearly 3 hours I'm still wanting more. \n\nI am aware of the Developers no longer actively developing the game, and I understand. The game had a only minor issues playing in the last day of 2020. Zombie got stuck on final mission by porta potty being so close to another mesh (barrel) Sometimes its one sometimes 2 zombies. First 4 missions were very straight forward and got harder as you went along. Final mission (Mission 5) can be very difficult and takes time and special zombies. Tried with numbers and its a def no go slaughter. \n\nI wanted to give a good review because 6 years later of wanting to play this game in full release, I see it won't happen unfortunately. \n\n\nTLDR: I recommend if the game play appeals, only 5 missions 2 skirmish maps and 1 alpha map playground. Maybe another 2 hours and (plus my 3 currently) for a total of around 5 hours of game play.\n\nPros:\nYou get to play as zombies!\nFairly short incase you need a break from other games. \nVery tactical and engaging\nI mean it was only $14 (some could argue this be too much, but I think for what I played would be worth $10) \n\nCons:\nFairly short incase you wanted more\nNo longer in active development\n\nThough if you are strapped for cash, this game will not be going on discount anytime soon. Check the game out on youtube. Though I see the hard work put into this with a small staff, I still had fun for the Beta stage it was left in. No game breaking issues, played on max settings. The only crash I had was the first load. Reloaded no issues since. \n\nShame it isn't in active development or plans for release with DLC pack. I'd pay for an expansion if it helped get these guys back up and running. I do wish they could have given community tools to allow for mods and such. Though wishful thinking at this point. Cheers.\n\nEdit now after 6 hours*\n\nPros:\nPreset controls that make it easier to attack small groups\nVaried amount of zombie types\nGreat music\nPressing Shift while scrolling the map makes it a bit faster to look around\n\nCons:\nSkirmish 2 is very laggy, but I managed to beat it.\nAlpha play map is very small, and can get very laggy if you place one too many zombies or survivors.\nKeybinds are unchangeable\nLacks a x2 speed in gameplay\nLacks a go to icon function incase a zombie gets stuck (you have to manually find them)\n\nStill enjoyable, leaves me wanting more.","timestamp_created":1609486210,"timestamp_updated":1609654174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwk7C34/YCeImqvwI="}
