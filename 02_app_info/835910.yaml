    review: 'Unfortunately I have to advise against buying the game. It is simply
      a scam.

      I could play the game for 11 minutes until it crashed. Since then it can no
      longer be started and is unplayable. So I contacted the developer and sent him
      the error message. More than 2.5 months have passed since the message and there
      is not a single feedback from the developer.


      So I would like to give an absolute warning before buying and consider it a
      fraud. Unfortunately Steam cannot refund the purchase price because more than
      two weeks have passed since the purchase.'
