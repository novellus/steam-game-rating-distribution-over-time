    about_the_game: "Croquet Pro 2 Association Edition takes the gameplay of the original\
      \ and adapts it to 6-wicket, association style rules. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting\
      \ with a coin toss to determine the right of choice, two players each control\
      \ two balls in a game of strategy and skill. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe objective\
      \ of the game is to score 13 points with each ball by running 6 hoops forward\
      \ and backwards then pegging out. The player can knock other balls and take\
      \ roquet in order to position the best winning strategy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      A deadness board, scorecard, and diagram of the court can be viewed in the pause\
      \ menu. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is played by selecting a move (i.e. strike\
      \ the ball, switch balls, let balls lie and end turn) then selecting the court\
      \ to position the mallet. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReleasing the press will fire\
      \ the mallet from the indicated position with a power related to the distance\
      \ from the ball. For the starting turns and when taking roquet, the balls is\
      \ placed by selecting within the purple line or circle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      From the seasoned croquet player to the novice, Croquet Pro 2 is a unique and\
      \ fun game unlike any other."
