      \ in the Sino-Japanese War of the Fantasy World. The end result also depends\
      \ on your strength and choice."

    short_description: You unfortunately passed through the Sino-Japanese War, and
      became the Admiral of the North Sea Navy in the Qing Dynasty. What is more unfortunate
      is that this is not a history you are familiar with. This is an era when magic
      replaces machinery. Can you lead your army to achieve the final victory?
