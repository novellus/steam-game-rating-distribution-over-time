    review: "[u] Summary: [/u]\nIt's a cheap game that's worth a look if you've ever\
      \ wanted to try a hex based tactics game, but were never willing to spend a\
      \ big amount of money on the idea. It's basic strategy elements have been done\
      \ before, but the replayability does get boosted with the ability to grab skills\
      \ based on the missions you take on. There's an element of strategy that's present\
      \ here in the way that you grab minions and their specific strategies and weaknesses\
      \ they have against each other. It's not going to stick around long, while there\
      \ is some replayability, it's too simple at the surface, and the game isn't\
      \ too complicated in the end. But it's solid for a cheap price, and has a couple\
      \ of cheesy moments to help make the game a little bit more out there in the\
      \ end. There will be a bug here and there, and it's not the most visually appealing\
      \ game out there, but it does the job where it needs to in its gameplay. \n\n\
      \n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/w_N_4mjAexg[/b]\n\n\
      [u] Lists: [/u]\n\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Core tactics are reasonable for the\
      \ price, especially considering the idea of replayability and the different\
      \ traits that you can take.\n[*] Good introduction to basis strategy mechanics.\
      \ Not too complicated, but complicated enough to cause you to actual attempt\
      \ to \n[*] Story moments have groan inducing humor, but honestly that is a plus\
      \ in my book as it did get a laugh or two out of me.\n[*] Do like the randomization\
      \ elements in there, even if they may be imbalanced over time. \n[*] Seems reasonable\
      \ for the price that it's going for. \n[*] Visuals do have a certain charm to\
      \ them in the end. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Veterans of the tactics\
      \ genre won't find enough here to keep them entertained over a long period of\
      \ time. \n[*] The music does get repetitive after a while, even if I wasn't\
      \ necessarily expecting that much out of it.\n[*] Main campaign is short despite\
      \ replayability. \n[*] A bug here and there. In particular, certain character\
      \ specific events can cause unmovable states due to not being able to select\
      \ any more minions. \n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding\
