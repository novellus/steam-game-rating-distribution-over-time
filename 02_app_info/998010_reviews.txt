That and some of the images are nice.\n\nThe first Chroma game was interesting enough as it didn't wear out its welcome. But by God, all that time you're spending comes at the price of extreme tediousness. Some of the levels repeat and some are near/outright impossible, halting your progress for that girl. I could only go through a few sets at a time before having to save it for later.\n\nThere are better hentai (and/or Achievement) games for $1.","timestamp_created":1597467638,"timestamp_updated":1597467638,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529521048069000244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj7ef+PMCd//FmwI="}
