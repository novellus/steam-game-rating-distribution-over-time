Yet after 4 years I see it in Steam with upgraded gameplay and visuals, and I'm intrigued to finish what I started (Of course the 2,99â‚¬ price tag helped as well). I was happily surprised how well the developers managed to update pretty much everything in the game for the better, and I ended up enjoying most of the playthrough!","timestamp_created":1608055757,"timestamp_updated":1608055757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525057792663574219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jPPls/YCcp3AugI="}
