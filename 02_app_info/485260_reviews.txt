The last few levels of each act provide some decent challenges. Going for the Gold quality completion achievement for every level provides some challenge.\n\nGood for playing co-op with someone who's not into hardcore platformers.","timestamp_created":1562004295,"timestamp_updated":1562004295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41cGt1+sCeuP8yQE="}
