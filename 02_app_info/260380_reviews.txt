No decent explanation of why things are happening. The opposing team seems to be able to to do things you can't and there is no explanation for why. You hit a wall and just lose repeatedly with no feeling of \"well maybe I did something wrong\". Its a losing simulation. You play, you lose.\nThis is just a very poorly made game. I want to believe there is a way to progress but the game is so opaque and bland that I just can't be bothered. FYI, I tend to play very hard core games on the highest difficulties. Those games are interesting and there is SOME method of discerning why I lose. This provides none of that. Its just horrible.","timestamp_created":1581986725,"timestamp_updated":1581986725,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yLfwqvACe+/98gE="}
