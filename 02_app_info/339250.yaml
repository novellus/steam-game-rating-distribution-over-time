    review: 'I''ve bought all other winged sakura games and I really liked them, simple,
      straight forward, and good

      but for this one I can''t recommend it, if you''re a winged sakura fan like
      me and don''t like "endless dungeon" game then don''t buy this game, this game
      is completely different from other winged sakura games, you won''t get that
      good story and simple game anymore, it''s not even an RPG for me, the story
      won''t be combined with the gameplay, so you can always read the story or just
      don''t read it at all, it''s like a sandbox game, so it will feel like the story
      is not progressing at all. And also the story is the exact same as mindy''s
      arc, yeah dream world again, yeah training again, memory wipes again, her sister
      behind everything again, cecilia guide again, no telling lost memories again.


      The rpg element? there isn''t one, there''s no chance for you to grind anything
      and when you die you lost all your progress, and don''t worry you''ll always
      die, in fact you won''t need the continue button there, you will die every like
      half hour. I''m 18 hours in this game and this is still happening. I''m really
      disappointed in this game, it''s not winged sakura except for the anime art'
