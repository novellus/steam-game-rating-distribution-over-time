      \ layout with fast straights to create a unique challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nDesigned by circuit boss Jonathan Palmer, the 300 circuit takes inspiration\
      \ from a number of the planet's leading motor racing venues, whilst the 200\
      \ circuit retains the spirit of the original airfield layout.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe circuit's corner names are drawn from some of motorsport's greats, from\
      \ two-wheeled legend Giacomo Agostini to current F1 superstar Lewis Hamilton,\
      \ whilst Wilson is named in honour of Palmer's former prot\xE9g\xE9 Justin Wilson\
      \ who was killed in the USA in 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSnetterton is the latest\
      \ british classic added to Automobilista, based on LIDAR scan data for superior\
      \ accuracy. The track includes both 300 and 200 layouts."
