And none of them are even very good, by the way. They tend to fall under \"slightly janky controls\" (frying and spreading) or boring (any minigame with randomized button presses like egg cracking).\n\nFurthermore, all this padded out by extremely shallow restaurant management between cooking sessions. Restaurant level cooking experience, sitting and serving customers? No nuance with anything like upgrades and skills and the like. They all serve no purpose other than to artificially extend the game time and bar you from quickly steamrolling through the recipes one by one. Oh, and you're doing all this yourself. These other chefs that are teaching you these recipes just stand there and don't do anything on their own. You're still doing the cooking for each customer, one by one. And as the one cook, I shouldn't have to be playing the roles of manager and server as well for an establishment as large as the one being run. Hell, you don't even get money. Just experience to progress you closer to unlocking all the recipes and reaching the end of the game's \"story,\" which is barely existent. \n\nLook, if you're looking for a game that's as simple, relaxing, and leisurely paced as the [i]Cooking Mama[/i] series, you can do better. You might as boot up your old DS with your copy of [i]Cooking Mama 2[/i] and get your fix that way, because [i]Cooking Star Restaurant[/i] doesn't scratch that itch.","timestamp_created":1608964016,"timestamp_updated":1609057312,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0MPS0fYCetOlvQI="}
