You should buy it. \n\nWhy you'll buy it? If you get the game on sale, get this at the same time, you'd be stupid to pass on this offer, it's cheap and it will help you get all the cars without doing the same tracks again and again and again. It's a REALLY good deal if you compare to any mobile game's micro-transactions.\n\nWhy I don't recommend you buy it? Because they clearly state that you will get something that you will NOT get. The Santa special edition of the Thor 8800? You can't get it because there is NO Thor 8800 in that game! They removed it, I don't know when, but it's been a long time if we believe the other reviewers! I can't recommend, it's false representation...\n\nI want my Santa Truck, goddammit. \n","timestamp_created":1609308165,"timestamp_updated":1609308165,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uLqP2fYCdvvXvgI="}
