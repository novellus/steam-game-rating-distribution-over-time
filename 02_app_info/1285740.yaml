    review: "I bought this game mainly because I had hoped that it would give me a\
      \ great video to commentate for my YouTube channel. And let's just say that\
      \ it did not disappoint. Here is my opinion to the game as a whole. Its pretty\
      \ much a mobile game on desktop. Or rather...ita a 3D version of the original\
      \ world's hardest game...but in a simpler sense.\n\nThe game graphics were very\
      \ nice and the challenge was definitely there. After nearly 2 hours I have nlt\
      \ even beaten 3 levels. But depending on if my viewers give me my like goal....I\
      \ may have to finish the game lol.\n\nIt looks as if I am going to have to finish\
      \ the grueling game in due time. I just hope that the many swears that are going\
      \ to come out of my mouth don't get me kicked out of the house....\n\nHere is\
      \ the first video of this game in my channel. Who knows if I will make a second\
      \ \U0001F60F\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rTsiaRAYrlc"
