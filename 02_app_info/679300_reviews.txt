[b]some of them need audio clues, but they were stored on the game's website, which is not available anymore[/b], so check the forum for download links. honestly, who thought this would be a good idea? why not just store them with the rest of the game? and if you can't be bothered to change it, at least don't let the domain expire. one takes some effort, the other some money, pick one.\n\nthe presentation is pleasantly minimalist (except one of the fonts for the in-level story bits, too basic) and the audio is fantastic as well, but there's only a master and sfx volume slider, plus resolutions and windowed mode via the unity launcher. and for such a story-heavy game, [b]there should be an in-game place to re-read all the story bits without launching every level separately[/b].\n\ngotta cater to masochists, no problem with that, but some of the design decisions are questionable at best. [b]with a few improvements it would be a truly excellent game[/b] for a more than reasonable price, except [b]it's broken, the final level set hasn't been accessible for years[/b] without editing the save file (there aren't enough bits otherwise), and some breakthroughs are also broken. not sure how something like this can result in all those positive reviews, people (including developers) really have no standards these days. [b]obviously don't waste money and time on this until (if ever) they decide to fix what they're asking money for.[/b]","timestamp_created":1607744165,"timestamp_updated":1607744262,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596334338188171387","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw99HBqvYCcaiquQI="}
