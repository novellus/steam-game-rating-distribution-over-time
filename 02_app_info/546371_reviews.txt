I haven't been able to get any help so far from steam or from My.com. So I am a bit ticked off that I cant even use the dlc I bought. Steam says its a my.com problem, that steam doesn't handle stuff for their dlc. And my.com hasn't said anything, their support area has no info on how to access the in game dlc. I just have to hope that the ticket I submitted gets answered soon. Cause at this point im just getting fed up. And unfortunately I cant even get my money back for the dlc, as it says it is not eligible for a refund. All in all, if I had to do it all over again, I just would pick a different game.","timestamp_created":1517686973,"timestamp_updated":1517686973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509370326995849609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pKzMruECe771lwE="}
