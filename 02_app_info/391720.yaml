    short_description: "Layers of Fear is a first-person psychedelic horror game with\
      \ a heavy focus on story and exploration. Players take control of a painter\
      \ whose sole purpose is to finish his Magnum Opus. The player must navigate\
      \ through both a constantly changing Victorian-era mansion and ghastly visions\
      \ of the painter\u2019s fragile and crumbling psyche."

    review: This is more of an immersive story than a game, but as a person who thought
      he did not like such games, I could not get enough of this. Thrills, some jump
      scares, nice plays with the "impossible geometry" idea. I did not want it to
      end.
