First puts you in the shoes (or paws, I think) of what seems to be a cat, in service of the king of the game's world. Your duty, as the chosen hero, is to save the land by taking back a precious crystal that holds some pretty neat powers.\n\nThe game starts off slow, giving you time to get used to the characters and how the combat system works. After that, things start to get harder as you progress with more obstacles coming your way and much more powerful monsters.\nThere's no difficulty option which in a way I like a lot. It gives off that nostalgic feeling of how old games used to be.\n\nThe hack n slash part of the game does take a little while to master, as it can be pretty jumpy at times, but with a little effort, you can get the hang of it quite alright.\nYour hero can get more powerful by purchasing better weapons and accessories to increase his stats in combat. They are a must if you want to have an easier time surviving the hordes of monsters.\nIf you're not careful and want to collect every single item on the go, I advise caution. You need to plan your investments a bit here as there may be times where you'll have no healing food left to survive the next chambers so be sure to always be stocked on that.\n\nNow let's move on to the world itself.\nYou're going to go through different biomes in your adventures, ranging from green forests and deserts to icy lands and fiery volcanoes. You've got all the colors mother nature already graces us with in real life.\nEach biome has it's own set of monsters and obstacles specific to that zone and you will need to be prepared when you enter them. \n\nThe fun part is that besides the main quest that takes you through all these zones, there's also a few side quests you can accept that will reward you with items or currency to spend. It's a fun side activity to do when you don't really feel like saving the world.\nI don't want to go in big details here since there's spoilers but even after finishing the main story, there will be new stuff to do so replayability is there in case you want some more.\n\nAs a last tip, be sure to talk to any NPC you see. Some of them have special rewards for you for tasks as simple as killing 30 monsters.\nTake your time and explore everything, like in any RPG! :)\n\nFor the current price tag that the game has, I'd say it's well worth it. You can get at least a few hours of content and that is if you plan on speedrunning the whole thing.\nIf you take your time and playing it casually, it can easily take you 4 to 5 hours to finish the whole thing. Plus some more if you want to keep going after you're done with the main quest.\nA game well worth spending your day on.\n","timestamp_created":1598825286,"timestamp_updated":1598825286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl7naoPQCdZDqngI="}
