    review: "I picked this up after being mentioned on Crate and Crowbar as a puzzle\
      \ game with very short rounds appealed.  It fits that comforting spot very well.\
      \ I can play a few rounds while other stuff is happening around me in the house.\
      \ As an older game it's also at the right price. I have never been a graphics\
      \ obsessive, but to me these graphics have an old-school style, but work fine\
      \ on my <1yr old Windows gaming laptop, and I never have trouble working out\
      \ what a particular tile is. The game structure is an elegant idea with not\
      \ too many pieces, where the pieces combine well to create lots of interesting\
      \ variation. \n\nThere's things you can nitpick. The achievements aren't linked\
      \ with Steam. The strangest design choice, to me, is that everything is completely\
      \ turn based (making it a great game for partial attention or when being interrupted),\
      \ except for one key phase in every round, which has a ten second timer. I think\
      \ they made a mistake here, and it would have been better to have no \"race\"\
      . But it's a quibble. It's a fun game; soothing, but not so much it puts you\
      \ to sleep."
