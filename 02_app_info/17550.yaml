    review: Got a Planetside feel. Not great graphics, yet fun. Would be great to
      invite friends. Community totally dead due to age of this game. 8/10 not to
      lure ppl into playing a dead game, but to let ya know the game is small in size,
      simple and immersive to be able to attack and overtake capitol ships
