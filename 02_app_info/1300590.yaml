      differently? I thought about it, and an idea for the game <strong>Taiga</strong>
      appeared in my head. The basis for this idea was a game that you know about
      if you were here. A game that I will never stop admiring, and that I continue
      to play.<br><br>Once, THE LONG DARK looked at survival mode in its own way,
      and I dared to hold this ray of light through myself.<h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2><br><u>Taiga</u>
      is a harsh survival simulator in the Taiga forests of Russia. There is constant
      cold, wild nature, clean air and time go slower. There are no zombies, no creepers,
      no geomagnetic disasters, only the nature of our vast planet. Do not expect
      mercy from her, she is harsh and does not spare anyone. You'll have to make
      your own decisions. What determines whether you Wake up in a soft bed by the
      stove, or not Wake up at all. This is the only way to survive until the warm
      days to gain strength before new difficulties.<h2 class="bb_tag">About Limitless

      have an office, I just live in Orenburg. I am developing alone and am puzzled
      to create a small team to work on this project.
