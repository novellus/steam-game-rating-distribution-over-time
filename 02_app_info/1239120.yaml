    review: "I believe each early access product deserves to have at least one long\
      \ review, especially when it's such kind of product. In my opinion, this is\
      \ the best example of early access game you can find. \nRight now it's completely\
      \ playable, so far I've not found any critical bugs or imperfections which can\
      \ ruin your gameplay experience. Good job, developers!\n\nNow about the game\
      \ itself. This is kinda puzzle game, where the main goal is to to reach point\
      \ B from point A. Many of levels i have seen so far have different ways to be\
      \ completed. Also, most levels have pretty unique ideas and mechanic interactions.\
      \ The difficulty increases pretty gradually, depending on how many levels you\
      \ have accomplished.\n\nSo this is logical puzzle, (obviously) inspired by Portal\
      \ and dungeon clawlers, with a number of achievements and challenges, which\
      \ will definitely blow your mind. If you like hardcore games (i don't) or ones\
      \ like solitaire, you are very welcome!"
