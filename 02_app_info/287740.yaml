    review: "[b]- Endora: Samantha, I will not stand here and be insulted by something\
      \ which is 94 percent water.\n- Darrin Stephens: Oh, yeah! Well, what about\
      \ something which is a hundred percent hot air?\n\nBewitched (1964 - 1972)[/b]\n\
      \nWell... This is the first of Mousechief's games that I've tried, and... I\
      \ am bored out of my wits. First and foremost, the game doesn't deliver anything\
      \ it says in the store description: no, it is not a delightful reading - the\
      \ narrative is boorish and the humor is forced; it has nothing to do with any\
      \ kind of theatre experience aside the usage of the word \"cue\", and as a game\
      \ that claims to be a hybrid between a P&C adventure and a visual novel, it\
      \ fails at both genres!\n\nOkay, let's begin with the story. Here we have a\
      \ middle-aged witch who has foresworn magic to live happily with her chosen\
      \ mortal. She gets married, has three kids and lives happily ever after until\
      \ she loses her husband to cancer. Wednesday is now alone and apparently on\
      \ a full-blown midlife crisis, since she opens a yarn shop to become a productive\
      \ and independent woman of the 21st century, alongside her familiar, Greta -\
      \ who is a mushroom in a pot. Her mother and most her other relatives belittle\
      \ her choice and wish for her to come back to her magical ways, but Wednesday\
      \ persists. She'll run this yarn shop with success, to prove that she is and\
      \ always will be more than what her relatives deemed her to be.\n\nAs you can\
      \ see, this is, more or less, the ever after part for [i]Bewitched[/i]: what\
      \ happens after the happily ever after, right? The idea itself is nice, and\
      \ if it were not to bear deep rooted execution mistakes, it might have been\
      \ fun even. But as it is, it is one of the most boring games I've ever played;\
      \ and I'm claiming this as a long standing visual novel gamer. No, I don\u2019\
      t have any problems with either a static/slow progressing gameplay or reading\
      \ blocks of texts for the sake of story; as long as the narrative is interesting,\
      \ characters are endearing and realistic; and the interaction is somewhat enjoyable.\
      \ Heck, it is none of the above for this game.\n\nLet's start with the display.\
      \ I am aware for this to be a low budget indie game anyhow; but who in their\
      \ right minds would use full static clip arts for character avatars? That is\
      \ plain ridiculous. The screen size is stuck in a small window, in which reading\
      \ hurts your eyes and gives you a headache immediately. Environment art is neither\
      \ esthetic, nor sensible; and the same 2 jazz tracks loop on the background\
      \ with appalling audio quality. Thus, even if the narrative would be interesting\
      \ enough, you'd give in after your first 10 minutes, and get done with this\
      \ thing.\n\nStill, I have persisted for nearly 2 hours, and all that I have\
      \ managed to discover at the end of 3rd chapter is... that characters are not\
      \ relatable since they bear the depth of a rainy day sidewalk puddle, the humor\
      \ is the driest I've ever seen - like it's been taken out of a 50s infomercial\
      \ - and the gameplay is insufferable. At every scene, you are given the option\
      \ to click one of the topics - people, things, events etc. - from the bar to\
      \ initiate some kind of scene for them. They are called cues. You keep clicking\
      \ them in the right order in hopes of reaching for your goal and make the story\
      \ progress. But these interactions are deadly repetitive, and it takes time\
      \ for you to go through various options since you'd have no idea what a positive\
      \ cue for Wednesday would be, and what would be a negative cue. You keep going\
      \ through cues until you magically solve the current scene - which apparently\
      \ counts as a \"puzzle\" for this game - and you carry on through another block\
      \ of insufferable dialogue. There you go: picking cues counts as P&C, and reading\
      \ texts counts as VN, huh? But the game erases the enjoyable part of both of\
      \ those genres: a VN asks for character and narrative depth first and foremost;\
      \ and a P&C adventure needs that \"aha!\" moment when you finally arrange the\
      \ right combination for an actual puzzle to progress the story. Since you can\
      \ only use given cues here, no \"aha!\" moment for you. You just play through\
      \ some probabilities. Should this be called a revolutionary combination of two\
      \ genres? Nope, nope, nope. I cannot take this anymore. Thank you.\n\nAs a lover\
      \ of stories in games, this is one of those rare moments that I'll leave a game\
      \ unfinished. I simply cannot handle the bore. It might come as a harsh judgement,\
      \ but please, stay away from this game. Both for a VN or a P&C adventure, you\
      \ can do thousands of times better than this.\n\nPlease also check out Lady\
