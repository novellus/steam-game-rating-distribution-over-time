It was off to a bad start from the get go, since I had to change the resolutions setting because otherwise only half of the screen was visible.\n\nThe game is clunky and has close to no plot. You just stumble around from location to location collecting things. Also, the sound quality of the dialogues is awful. Sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine from the 90s. The music is good but it's twenty second clips that loop and loop over and over again.\n\nI got this game on a Hidden Object bundle. Since I didn't spend much on it I was going to be lenient on my judgment and give it a good review, although it looked to be a (and positively turned out to be) very basic, boring game. However, having a bug that breaks the game like that is unacceptable. The game doesn't have any achievements, so I was playing it just to relax and pass the time. I have no interest in nor incentive for re-starting the entire game. I was three hours into it, I already got a feel of the game and I can see the ending being meh at best.\n\nThe glitch has been pointed out before on the discussions and on the reviews, almost a year ago, yet there doesn't seem to be any fix coming. I guess it makes sense this game is thrown into a bundle. Otherwise no one would buy it.","timestamp_created":1608502539,"timestamp_updated":1608502813,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lKSPwfYCdfrnuwI="}
