    review: "Ah, the controversy, the controversy!\n\n   If you look at the forums\
      \ relating to this product, you'll see no end of hostility towards the fact\
      \ of it even BEING on Steam. So in the interests of lowering the number of thumb-downs\
      \ for the review about to occur, let me say that: a. I am in no way affiliated\
      \ with anyone who made the film, or anyone who works for Dwarven Forge (though\
      \ they can send me free stuff, should they be so inclined), b. I watch a lot\
      \ of documentaries, read a lot of non-fiction books and magazine articles, and\
      \ listen to no end of commentaries on DVDs and Blu-Rays, so I actually do dig\
      \ this sh*t, and c. anyone who thumbs down my review PURELY because I gave this\
      \ product a positive response, without so much as even reading it, is a puerile,\
      \ knee-jerk C*NT-F*CK who can EAT MY A*SE-PELLETS for all I care. \n\n   At\
      \ least do me the common courtesy of sticking with me for another paragraph\
      \ or two, THEN thumb me down. Cheers in advance.\n\n   Okay, so I'm in my early\
      \ forties and grew up playing...well, not strictly Dungeons & Dragons, but certainly\
      \ a wide variety of tabletop roleplaying games, all of them undeniably owing\
      \ their lineage to that great, wise ol' grandaddy of RPGs. While I don't roleplay\
      \ too often these days, such tabletop games hog a HUGE sentimental spot inside\
      \ my heart, and this is a documentary about another childish w*nker in his forties\
      \ who refuses to grow up. \n\n   What's more, it's a very WELL-MADE documentary\
      \ about a childish w*nker in his forties who refuses to grow up, which captures\
      \ the youthful spirit of such dreamers very, very nicely indeed. It's perhaps\
      \ not the BEST film about the subject in question - there's a recently-released\
      \ fiction film called Zero Charisma which probably deserves that honour - but\
      \ it is of indisputably good quality.\n\n   Two questions still remain, though:\
      \ is it worth ten dollars to purchase, and should it be on Steam?\n\n   Hmmm...tricky\
      \ questions, to be sure. To me, ten dollars? Absolutely. I didn't grow up in\
      \ an entitled, selfish generation which believes it should get everything for\
      \ free. Sure, I dubiously download plenty of stuff, but sometimes I'm willing\
      \ to acknowledge that it took someone longer than 0.9 nanoseconds of their time\
      \ to produce a product, and henceforth I'm happy to give them a small slice\
      \ of what little money I have. \n\n   Trust me when I say that this documentary\
      \ is unlikely to make anyone filthy rich, so this is clearly a labour of love.\
      \ Henceforth, it doesn't deserve your vitriol as much as, say, I don't know...Bill\
      \ Gates' recent pet virus, aka \"Windows 10\"? Whoever made this movie made\
      \ it to share something with other human beings, not to buy more third-world,\
      \ ten-year-old sex slaves to fill the basements of their many mansions. Save\
      \ your cynicism for the big guns.\n\n   Should it be on Steam? Hmmm...a harder\
      \ question. Given that there seems to be no end of short and feature films with\
      \ LITTLE TO NO RELATION TO GAMING on Steam of late, I'd say this one easily\
      \ qualifies as \"relevant\" by comparison. Put it another way: without Dungeons\
      \ & Dragons, there almost certainly wouldn't be f*cking SKYRIM, or even Dark\
      \ Souls for that matter. But for anyone who wants to make a lucid, mature argument\
      \ that perhaps Steam isn't an appropriate platform for distributing videos,\
      \ period, I'm not necessarily going to argue with you.\n\n   In all honesty,\
      \ this product was an impulse buy, and partly because I had Steam dollars just\
      \ sitting there waiting to be spent. Do I consider it ten dollars well spent?\
      \ Absolutely. Could I have just downloaded it for free from somewhere else off\
      \ the internet? Probably. But somebody, sometime, should perhaps pay for this\
      \ sh*t, or else people will stop making movies altogether, and whoever made\
      \ this isn't Michael f*cking Bay. Ten bucks isn't a lot of money, and once Valve\
      \ takes their cut, I sincerely doubt that anyone involved with this film will\
      \ be buying their Mum a new mansion with the proceeds.\n\n   Short version:\
      \ if you're looking for a Steam-distributed video to hate on, this really isn't\
      \ the one. Start your battle elsewhere, and perhaps slowly make your way back\
      \ to this if your vitriol carries you that far. As far as I'm concerned, any\
      \ GAME-related (and not just VIDEO game-related) documentary has a place here.\
      \ You don't agree, then don't buy it. Surely you have better things to do with\
      \ your time than troll Store pages.\n\n   Cheers to anyone who bothered to read\
      \ this far - I know this review has a few more words and far less pictures than\
      \ your average Facebook post - and if you still think I deserve a big, fat thumb-down,\
      \ go for it. I'll be the first to admit that I do enjoy a good rant. Cheers\
      \ to Steam for giving me the space in which to do so (hey, whadya know, it IS\
      \ still a \"free\" world after all...for another fortnight or so, at least)!!\n\
      \nVerdict: 8/10.\n\nUPDATE: I've just finished watching this documentary for\
      \ the third time, and I gotta say, I love it. It really is a fantastically well-made\
      \ doco about chasing one's dreams, and what it takes to hold on to them. Let's\
      \ raise that 8 to a 9, eh?\n\nRevised Verdict: 9/10."
