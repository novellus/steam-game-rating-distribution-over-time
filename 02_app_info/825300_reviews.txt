Some of the lines were absolutely terrible. Like when one LI was sucking the MC off, he thought, \"He's like an industrial vacuum.\" Or while they were cuddling, \"He's such a tight packet of meat.\" There are a lot of bad lines like that.\nOn top of that, the choices aren't really all that interesting. There are only ever two options and you can clearly see what the result of them will be. You can either be nice or be a jerk, that's it. The story lines themselves, even once you choose a character to pursue, overlap so much that it feels like there's very little replay value. The stories are also extremely short. I got through two runs of it in less than 4 hours. You only get to know about what the characters have been through in one or two long monologues, instead of having it spaced out in a more natural timeline. Even then, you don't really get to know the characters all that well.\nFrom an art standpoint, it's pretty, but also the anatomy doesn't really make sense. Sometimes I was distracted from an intimate scene by the bad anatomy work, but maybe that's just because I'm an artist myself and I've studied a fair amount of anatomy. That's likely not a breaking point for most people, but it did bother me a lot.\n\nOverall, if I'd known how it was going to be, would I have spent money on it? Yes. Would I have spent $20? Absolutely not. I would have spent maybe $5. Definitely not more than $10.","timestamp_created":1610133173,"timestamp_updated":1610133173,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sM7a8fYCfajOwQI="}
