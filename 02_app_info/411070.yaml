    about_the_game: "Mass Vector is a physics based game of skill and patience designed\
      \ to be played by all the family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn fact it's really 2 games\
      \ in one with 50 speed levels and 50 Hazard levels.                        \
      \           <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Speed levels are against the clock and are\
      \ designed to reward the fastest players. These levels may look simple but when\
      \ you are racing to get the fastest time you need to keep your cool.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe 50 Hazard levels on the other hand are not timed but they will\
      \ require skill, patience and perseverance to complete. On the hardest difficulty\
      \ level they are very hard!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea is simple. Manoeuvre\
      \ your ship by controlling its thrusters. Pick up the coloured blocks using\
      \ your tractor beam and place them on the green platforms. What could be simpler.\
      \ Of course it's not that straight forward. The coloured blocks come in different\
      \ shapes and sizes and range from light (Green) to heavy (Blue) which makes\
      \ them awkward to move and control with your ship. To help lift the heavy blocks\
      \ you will need to visit the Boost stations, and visiting the Repair stations\
      \ will repair your ship when it has been damaged.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first\
      \ 10 speed levels guide you through what to do and how to do it. Plus they help\
      \ you gain points which can be used to buy upgrades for your ship when playing\
      \ the Hazard levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 4 player profiles mean you can play\
      \ against your friends and family. Each profile stores all of that players preferences\
      \ and scores. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 4 Player profiles for local competition.<br\
      \ />\r\n* 3 Difficulty settings.<br />\r\n* Keyboard &amp; Mouse control.<br\
      \ />\r\n* Xbox controller control. Including full menu options control.<br />\r\

    review: Was digging this game's physics and gameplay and controls but got stuck
      at around level 5.  Will probably come back to it later but this is just too
      difficult.  I don't mind a challenge but this is pretty ridiculous.
