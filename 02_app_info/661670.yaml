    review: "OK, this is the first part of ?. \nNaturally this one should hook up\
      \ the buyers and encorage them into buying the next part....even if only to\
      \ see the end of the story.\nWell, lets say I don't care about the rest of the\
      \ game.\nBut lets get into details.\nStory...you are mercs and after getting\
      \ an item from the enemy must travel to savety.\nThe 2 characters in your party\
      \ are without any background and I don't think that we'll see any interaction\
      \ between\nthem *at last not in this part*.\n\nIts a dungeon crawler pitting\
      \ you against annoying enemies.\nYour characters don't level up. The only way\
      \ for upgrading is through your weapon and 3 items.\nThose 4 can be upgraded\
      \ with found or bought items like leather, whool or spikes.\nThey have slots\
      \ you can permanently insert the items. At the end of the 1st part they can\
      \ have up to 4 slots and\nthe items raise your stats 2 points.....so no they\
      \ are not superheroes.\nYour journey is divided in chapters, each around 10\
      \ screens wide.\nSome have enemies, others are just for stretching the playtime.\
      \ Healing is done with items, one of the healing trees\nin each chapter or you\
      \ just walk around in circles till they are at full health again.\nEach chapter\
      \ has a vendor and a map *good these maps show you the secret room most chapter\
      \ has*.\nItems and gold are rare...so you must choose wisely what you buy and\
      \ use for upgrading.\nForget about hope for anything close to science.....you\
      \ still use a bow and staff, wield magic and\noh yes you can use some bombs.....in\
      \ most parts your only hope to survive the enemies.\nThe game also offers an\
      \ arena mode pitting you against rounds of enemies.....good luck there.\n\n\
      Finishing this game has take me just over 3 hours.\nRecommend this game I can\
      \ not.\nIt's just not enough game for me."
