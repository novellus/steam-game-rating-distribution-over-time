    about_the_game: "The loud and grating noises of a BR232 \u2018Ludmilla\u2019 make\
      \ this former Soviet diesel locomotive a favourite among German rail fans, and\
      \ now you can take control of this heavy freighter in Train Simulator.<br><br>Originally\
      \ built in the Ukraine between 1970 and 1982, the BR232 (then the DR Class 132)\
      \ was originally imported into the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).\
      \ The locomotive formed part of the DR 130 family of locomotives, which also\
      \ included the DR Class 130, Class 142 and DR Class 131. More than 700 units\
      \ in the DR 130 family were produced on a steel framework structure with attached\
      \ body, giving them a different external look to the normally refined and sleek\
      \ German locomotives.<br><br>During GDR times, many of the Class pulled any\
      \ trains that were generally fast or heavy, from express passenger trains on\
      \ non-electrified lines or coal and lime trains weighing more than 2,000 tonnes.<br><br>Following\
      \ the reunification of Germany, Deutsche Bahn inherited the DR 130 family of\
      \ locomotives, mainly as heavy freight locomotives but occasionally to head\
      \ passenger services. Nicknamed \u2018Ludmilla\u2019, many locomotives could\
      \ be seen working services from Germany\u2019s main cities, including Hamburg,\
      \ Kassel, Nuremburg and Kiel.<br><br>Today, most of the former DR 130 locomotive\
      \ family have been withdrawn from service but some continue to ply their trade\
      \ on Intercity passenger services and freight operations. Only a handful of\
      \ BR232 locomotives remain in service for DB.<br><br>The BR232 for Train Simulator\
      \ is available in Deutsche Bahn Orient Red and Traffic Red, and Railion liveries\
