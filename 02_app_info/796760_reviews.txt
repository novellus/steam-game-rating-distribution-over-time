You have to do a Windows 7 compatibility fix to get this game working on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Unfortunately, that messes up the game. The scales end up messed up and you have a fishbowl effect. So while playing this game you will feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters ... load up on the Dramamine and good luck with that. \n\nAnyways, I got this on sale for $1.39 USD and I can't get a refund because I waited too long to play it. You do need a room-scale setup. Don't waste your money on the Oculus Rift unless you're okay with the fishbowl effect ... mad props to you if you do.\n\n[b]Rate ??? / 10. It looks like a good game. I can't play it so I can't rate it. Therefore, I don't feel right giving it a negative review. You've been warned![/b]","timestamp_created":1560469853,"timestamp_updated":1560469912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566069424152374268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnKfQqesCd5quwwE="}
