I thought I'd seen every Arnie film, turns out I hadn't.\n\nIt's easily missable though, nothing really outstanding in this film, the acting seems very stale. The cheesy fake punch/gunfire sounds. All too cringe-worthy.\n\nDefinitely not the worst movie I've watched but I expected more from Arnie.","timestamp_created":1535250047,"timestamp_updated":1535250243,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571912467479705811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42/OCuuUCd4amqQE="}
