Slight annoyance that supposedly 0.5sec reload seems different from one gun to another, but I've enjoyed the gameplay, somewhat dungeon crawling and carnival shooter on 360 degree. \n\nThat said, it is probably too simple. Dungeons aren't randomized so not much replayability. only reason you play from early level is to grab more coins to buy expensive guns. As far as I've seen, it's all 1 on 1 fight after you chose a room to go to. unlock stronger guns and pay to acquire them seems redundant. Enjoyed picking loot around although a bit annoying to shoot cuz you've aimed a millimeter to the left.","timestamp_created":1596778885,"timestamp_updated":1596778885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+IXc4/MCc4/zmQI="}
