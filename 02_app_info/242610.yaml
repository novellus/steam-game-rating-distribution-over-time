    review: 'Such a fun, yet addicting game. I love 800 North''s games, they always
      put alot of effort and thought into them. This one is great so far even in early
      access. I 100% reccomend this game to anyone who plays FPS games. Right now
      it''s not that popular, but it has the potential to be. Give this game and Dino
      D day a try, I think you''ll change your mind.


      Update 3/22/2020: Development and online servers have ceased. Quite a shame
      since it could''ve had huge potential. If it was ever ported to VR, it would
      definitely be hit.'
