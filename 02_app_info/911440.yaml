    short_description: For many years you have been an excellent worker for the system.
      You have retrieved countless relics and faced hundreds of meaningless challenges.
      But every explorer has one last mission. You are starting to realize that your
      final quest inside the cyclical structure is near.

    review: "10/10 would buy again. \n10/10 hope to see the developer return with\
      \ future games.\n\n\n[h1]First impressions[/h1]\n\nI saw some friends purchase\
      \ this game and i liked the screenshots so upon seeing the Farewell post I went\
      \ ahead and grabbed it. \n\nAfter launching I was sad for a moment that it did\
      \ not support 2560x1080 but then again a lot of games still seem to lack ultra\
      \ wide support. Just look at Bethesda's sad fix for Fallout76 that modders did\
      \ better. :D\n\nSo, upon entering the game to me it felt like a puzzle game\
      \ I wasn't able to figure out. I read some of the update posts and thought perhaps\
      \ it was about imagination but I left a post in the Discussion to seek clarity\
      \ regarding these artifacts asking me to Write stuff. Developer responded super\
      \ quickly. \n\nI then moved on to explore until I felt I had hit a wall.. a\
      \ glass wall.. that was transparent and smokey black :D \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1682931732\n\
      \nI sent the developer a friend request and upon seeing where I was stuck promptly\
      \ said it wasn't suppose to be this way and they would get it resolved in approx\
      \ 30 min. \n:ThumbsUp: Pretty awesome considering they already posted their\
      \ Farewell and mentioned no more Steam support. For that reason alone I would\
      \ recommend the developer. Unfortunately it seems like I found them too late\
      \ as they are leaving Steam but hopefully they will still be out there.\n\n\n\
      P.S.  \nHere is a link to the manual just in case you've missed it. \nhttps://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/911440/manuals/Manual_(Eng).pdf\n\
      \nDev shared this link for it. \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/manual/911440\n\
      \n\n\n[h1]Thoughts after completion.[/h1] \n\nNow that I have completed the\
      \ game, even though it is not available on Steam I wanted to update with my\
      \ thoughts. \n\nWhen I purchased Evemnesis I honestly expected a short game.\
      \ And more of a walking simulator with a little story than anything. I was honestly\
      \ surprised at some of the challenge encountered with solving the puzzles and\
      \ to learn there were multiple worlds. Especially that  'a clue here' leads\
      \ to 'an answer there'. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1684414371\n\
      \nMy favorite feature has to be that you reach a point mid game that allows\
      \ you to teleport back and fourth between the various places. For someone like\
      \ me who likes to fully complete achievements having the ability to go back\
      \ versus starting a whole new game from the beginning is extremely awesome.\
      \ I wish more games of this genre did that. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1685123562\n\
      \n\nI really wish two things. \n\n1. I had found this game and developer sooner.\
      \ One of a handful of developers I have had the pleasure to meet that care about\
      \ their game and the people who buy it. Not only did he hotfix a bug quickly\
      \ but was kind enough to provide hints when needed to help me along, or even\
      \ backwards to discover something i overlooked. *Opsi*\n\n2. Valve actually\
      \ curated their own platform so this hidden gem didn't get lost in the pile\
      \ of \"cash grab\" or asset flip trash that litters steam and prevents users\
      \ from finding games that have real play-ability. \n\n\nP.S.S\nNot sure if all\
      \ my badgering was part of it :D but the amount of users who showed interest\
      \ after Valve disabled purchases prompted for developer CloudScapeGT to put\
      \ it up on itch after all. \nSo if you still want to play it (without steam),\
      \ https://cloudscapegt.itch.io/evemnesis"
