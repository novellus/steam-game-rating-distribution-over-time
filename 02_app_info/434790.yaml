    review: On the last few levels, the enemy is ridiculously more powerful than you
      are and there aren't any tactics that will tip the scales in your favor.  The
      best you can hope for is an even trade, which means you lose since the AI's
      drones are also more powerful than yours.  The only strategy that works is to
      avoid the enemy and try to take outposts faster than he can, which gets boring
      fast.  The game starts out fun but quickly turns into a grind.
