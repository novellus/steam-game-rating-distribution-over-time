Dracula: Origins wouldn't open at all. I even tried running it as Windows 7 as suggested by community, didn't fix it. Dracula: Love Kills is a nice way to kill time while bored out of your mind and watching YouTube in the background. Is it worth spending money on.. not really. Both the Dracula games are fairly cheap on their own and through the bundle, I think for the 2 Dracula games I only played an dollar extra. It's not really that much to cry over.\n\nBut, you are reading this for a reason. The story.. might as well click skip throughout it all. The story is really bad. The ending... all that work for that! Dracula looks like Brad Pitt thrown into the freezer. I don't suggest the game, but I rather play this game than sit through someone's high school graduation ceremony. So, it's not as bad as that.","timestamp_created":1609405227,"timestamp_updated":1609405227,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/9uB3PYCfoOGvwI="}
