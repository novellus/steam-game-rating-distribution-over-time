The guns feel very weak and the player has way too little health\n2. We need a cover system because there isn't a reliable way to escape the insanely accurate enemy fire.\n3. The city needs more pedestrians and cars to fill up the incredibly empty streets.\n4. Checkpoints and skippable cut scenes. If you fail a mission you have to completely restart and watch the boring cut scenes over and over again. \n5. Make the enemies less powerful. In one mission I got bum rushed with a dagger and the enemy hit me so fast I couldnt do anything about it. Plus the character is too slow to get away so I just died and had to restart the entire mission,","timestamp_created":1609787492,"timestamp_updated":1609787492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6viz5/YCcK69wAI="}
