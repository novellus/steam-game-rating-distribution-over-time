    review: "Aftter a whole 16 minutes played I can say with full confidence that...\n\
      \nThis game is is a visual mess. Dev guy needs to hire a grapical designer,\
      \ and probably someone else for the whole UX thing. It looks really bad and\
      \ is all over the place with fonts and colors. For me the visual aspect really\
      \ digs this down to a sub $1-tier (cant remember what I paid). \n\nIt's a a\
      \ defense game. But not a tower defense. It's monster-clicking game in first\
      \ person view but with a stuck camera. Monsters run by, you cast spells, using\
      \ keys 1-4 and mouse to aim. Sometimes (once during my 15 min of play) you are\
      \ forced into quick-time events where it'll literally display a few digits (1-4)\
      \ on the screen and you have to press them in order. It's awkward and reeks\
      \ of homebrew. The camera perspective is awkward as well.\n\nBut other than\
      \ all of that it's actually not so bad. The bosses movement and such were pretty\
      \ interesting at times. You can feel that the dev has tried, and someone clearly\
      \ has put quite some time into making this work. It looks like it's a complete\
      \ game with upgrades and stuff. If this had been on the homebrew scene (for\
      \ free) when PSP was first released, I'm sure it would have been popular.\n\n\
      But since It's really just a monster-clicker and not at a tower defense at all\
      \ the mechanics are just too dull, and it looks so bad. Gameplay wise it's not\
      \ even close to interesting enough to make it into a recommendable game. \n\n\
      Sorry!"
