    about_the_game: "The Maze is a VR Multiplayer game in which human players arrive\
      \ in a new realm after being teleported from their homelands. The size and purpose\
      \ of the maze is unknown, the only thing that is certain is that they have to\
      \ survive in this extremely hard environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Maze changes\
      \ according to our memories, imagination, dreams, and transforming it into an\
      \ even more chaotic realm as more people arrive. Environments change according\
      \ to the memories of the living beings within it. This means that areas in The\
      \ Maze change and shift randomly enabling a dynamic gaming experience.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nUpon arrival, players can choose any combination of two classes\
      \ to fit their own play style. An example is merging both the Summoner and Warrior\
      \ classes so that the player can act as a frontline fighter while at the same\
      \ time summoning creatures to deal damage. Gunslinger and Druid are other examples;\
      \ the player can deal damage from afar, root enemies into place and heal other\
      \ teammates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Maze has dozens of different species to\
      \ fight against. A few examples being Orcs, Trolls, Demons, Goblins, Elves,\
      \ Undead, and Lizards. When Humans first arrived, the other species viewed them\
      \ as nothing more than food or potential slaves. Humans aren\u2019t as strong\
      \ as Orcs, they don\u2019t have the fast health regeneration of Trolls, nor\
      \ do they have the high dexterity of Elves. Understaminating us will be their\
      \ mortal mistake. They don't know what a mother and a father will go through\
      \ to protect their loved ones, they don't know what a Human will endure to win\
      \ their revenge, they don't know that there will be people that will sacrifice\
      \ their lives for the freedom of others, they don\u2019t know how people can\
      \ do almost the impossible through faith, they don't know the creativity that\
      \ Humans have, how we can create something beautiful as art, music, sculptures\
      \ from just our imagination... However we can also create atomic bombs and weapons\
      \ of war. And they will know that there are Humans such as Napoleon, Sun Tzu,\
      \ Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar see war as an art itself."
