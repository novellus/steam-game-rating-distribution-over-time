    about_the_game: "Plot: You were a computer science professor. Once you wanted\
      \ to test your new invention, the &quot;Real Object Teleporting Portal Based\
      \ on Network&quot;. This special machine could digitalizes a real object and\
      \ send it to network wires by a connected computer, then transport it through\
      \ network wires to the target portal and instantiate it to the real world. After\
      \ some simple testing by small objects, you were ready to test it using your\
      \ own body. You entered the input portal. But you didn't know that there were\
      \ some viruses in the computer connected to the portal. The viruses hacked your\
      \ transport program and blocked you from getting into the network wires after\
      \ you were successfully digitalized. You stayed in the bus of your computer.\
      \ (Bus: a special kind of circuit which connects different parts in a computer\
      \ and transfers data between them.) The viruses blocked the output portal behind\
      \ you, so you couldn't get out. You knew that if you go to each hardware in\
      \ the computer to delete these loaded viruses, you could unblock the portal\
      \ then go back to human world safety.<br />\r\n-~-~-~-~-~-I'm the deluxe split\
      \ line -~-~-~-~-~-<br />\r\nHow to play?<br />\r\nThis game has 7 levels now.\
      \ They are 3 disk levels and 4 RAM levels.<br />\r\nIn disk levels, the viruses\
      \ come recurrently. You need to delete all of them with only one life to win.\
      \ Be careful with the magnetic read head that could illuminate a dangerous red\
      \ beam above you.<br />\r\n\uFF08In disk levels, the player is standing on the\
      \ rotating disk surface to fight viruses. So to be more real, I made the background\
      \ rotated with respect to the player. But if you feel dizzy because of the rotating\
      \ background (for example the ceiling), then you can turn it down by simply\
      \ click the &quot;Background Rotating&quot; button in the pause menu (Press\
      \ Esc). This will NOT affect the game rules.)<br />\r\nIn RAM levels, there\
      \ are 3 virus spawners that can spawn viruses. You need to delete all spawners\
      \ first, then delete all viruses to win. But because of the hacking of viruses,\
      \ the bridges in RAM levels will recurrently collapse and rebuild. If you are\
      \ careless, you may fall into the void then be deleted directly. But don't worry,\
      \ this time you have 2 extra recompile (revive) chance to help you win.<br />\r\
      \nThis game has 3 different types of viruses. The first kind is the basic ranged\
      \ attack virus, the second kind is the ranged attack virus with shield, and\
      \ the third kind is the close attack virus.<br />\r\nThe player has three special\
      \ abilities besides the basic attack. The first one is shooting a blast bullet\
      \ that can hurt all viruses in an area. The second one is creating a temporary\
      \ shield that can help you immunize all damages (except falling into the void).\
      \ And the third one is transmission, this ability is RAM levels only. After\
      \ a short time for preparation, it can help you get to a destination far away\
      \ from you up to 15 meters. This ability can be used to get out of viruses'\
      \ encirclement or pass a gap that is less than 15 meters and caused by collapsed\
      \ bridges. But it can't help you go through a wall or any other obstacles."

    short_description: This is a game that takes place in computer hardware. It's
      about you fighting against computer viruses. I'm a 16-year-old senior high student.
      I love computer programming or making and playing computer games. This is a
      game that I made it all by myself. I hope you enjoy it.
