The UI is sleek, the backgrounds are numerous and detailed, and the character sprites have a lot of different poses and expressions. Aesthetically, it's all very satisfying.\n\nThe puzzles require a bit of thought, but they aren't hard enough to be unsolvable, and they break up the dialogue nicely. The VN is paced well, it doesn't overstay its welcome, and the character dynamics are enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game a lot. It's clear the devs put a lot of love and attention into it, and it's well worth the asking price!","timestamp_created":1608725125,"timestamp_updated":1608824259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m8DZyvYCdv+2vAI="}
