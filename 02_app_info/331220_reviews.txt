It is one of the funnest local multiplayer games for my PC. There are not that many, but Thief Town stands out. It becomes a real blast as you franticly find and kill your mates, and the other gamemodes are creative, and don't dum-down the experience. As a nice fresh concept, it is only local multiplayer. I am fine with that, the four-kids-cramped-in-a-basement gaming sleepovers I have settle the need for others. Grab some friends, get some drinks, and start stabbing! Soundtrack not only fits, but is 8-bit dubstep. If you like getting your friends for monaco, or even a nintendo game like smash or mario party, you will LOVE this! I heard the app doesn't work that well, but I have controllers.","timestamp_created":1419834494,"timestamp_updated":1607534707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6CipPYCdMeYNA=="}
