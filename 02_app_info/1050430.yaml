    review: " you use your gun player to shoot down your enemy's and see how  far\
      \ you can survive without dying  - you start off with 5000 scraps which is money\
      \ to build up your gun in hopes to beat each level, can you survive or will\
      \ you lose - you decide. \n\nfun game but very challenging gear up while you\
      \ can because you will need it. redo levels to gain more scraps to buy from\
      \ the store. \n\nin order to control the gun wasd keys to move up and down and\
      \ mouse key to move side to side camera view basically \n\nthe music in the\
      \ game is loud so you  can't turn down in settings - \n\nI believe this might\
      \ be a port because it looks like this could be a mobile game. still a fun game\
      \ none the less and worth the buy"
