Kinda reminded me of the way spelunky and Rogue legacy did their randomizing\n\nKeep up the amazing work.","timestamp_created":1437349609,"timestamp_updated":1437349609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487293094396591187","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44s+t1M4CdsGtQQ=="}
