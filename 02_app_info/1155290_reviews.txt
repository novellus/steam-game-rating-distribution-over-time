Takes a good 40 sec before it comes back.\n+ You can wave at different bunnies with mouse click.\n+ If you wave at a chest you crash.\n+ You can get a save stuck inside a wall.\n+ Graphic settings reset every launch, and by graphic settings i mean FOV slider.\n+ Love the fact that you can't rotate the camera, you get a sense of pride when you find a block you couldn't see.\n+ Level 6 and 7 is easier than level 1. Which shows real progress, cause after going uphills you always go downhills.\n\n- Right click turns you around and i don't want to see a bunny butt in a childrens game.\n\nAll in all, get this game when it's not on sale so you can pay full price for this gem!!!","timestamp_created":1574902305,"timestamp_updated":1574902305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621648132801055908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jsLf1+4CfM2/3gE="}
