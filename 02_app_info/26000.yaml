    short_description: The pinnacle of alien evolution, Maw is a cowardly fat blob
      concerned mostly with snacking and lounging. He can, however, absorb the traits
      of anything he eats, is virtually indestructible, and can grow to unlimited
      size. If he wasn't a danger to all life in the universe, he'd make the perfect
      pet.
