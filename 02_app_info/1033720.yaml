    review: 'Literally its one single button. "Visual Novel", more like, "Screenplay
      with a single button to turn the page" Not even an exaggeration. The store page
      makes it seem like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, but there''s literally only
      the settings button and the advance button. . .


      You can skim through the whole game in less than a few minutes, and the story
      is so bland and unrealistic, it''s not even worth it to read. Who is cured of
      ''MaJoR dEpReSsIoN'' in a conversation that would realistically only last ten
      minutes??


      Played for three minutes and realized how ascinine the game-play was. Would
      not recommend unless you were looking for an awfully boring book to read.


      1/10





      Also why is this tagged with Villain Protagonist????'
