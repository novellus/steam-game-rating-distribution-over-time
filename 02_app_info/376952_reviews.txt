Everything works - cab light, large and small vacuum injectors, train heating, firebox cover etc, plus lovely sounds, and smoke and steam effects.  Also you get Collett coaches in GWR shirt button livery.  This is a pro-level loco, but perhaps a little more forgiving than some.  If you make your own GWR freeroams or create GWR scenarios this is a must piece of DLC or if you just want to run a lovely steam engine, pick this up in a sale and you can't go wrong.  Very highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1515932891,"timestamp_updated":1515932891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614035129547119141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ494ap+uACfr2HlgE="}
