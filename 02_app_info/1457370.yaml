    about_the_game: <strong>Welcome back to the Twenties!</strong><br><br>A murder
      has gripped the VIP section of a fancy train, and it's up to amateur sleuth
      Victoria and her omniscient feline friend Hercules to investigate. Meet the
      witnesses, hunt for clues, and gather alibis in a world where no-one will help
      you with anything until you solve a puzzle for them first!<br><br>With a run-time
      of a few hours, <i>Victoria Clair and the Mystery Express</i> is perfect for
      a weekend of puzzle-solving play! Tell a friend. Grab your cat. Maybe your cat
      will help you with the puzzles? I don't know. I had enough trouble getting my
      own cat to voice-act for this thing.
