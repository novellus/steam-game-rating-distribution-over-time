    review: 'i hate this game its fun for about 1 hour or so but after that wouldnt
      recommend playing it i reached 300 and i honestly think ill need rehab or a
      therapist after that main thing that messes with me i that it always feels like
      your character is actively trying to kill it self by smashing into the nodes
      and randomly grabing the wrong ones


      in short 4/10 wouldnt play again'
