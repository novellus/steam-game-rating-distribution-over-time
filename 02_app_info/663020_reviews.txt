With some bug fixes and a way to allow smaller play areas to reach the steerting wheel and mabye multiplayer would make the game a lot better but right now its got lots of bugs. overall i give it a 2/10","timestamp_created":1502412831,"timestamp_updated":1502412831,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567342102527618408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kY+y590Cfe2mggE="}
