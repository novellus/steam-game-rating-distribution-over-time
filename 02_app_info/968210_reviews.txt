Sorry that caused issues for you, I'll be sure to fix that.\n\nAs for the other concerns with the ball character, I'm intending to release a new version of the character soon that fixes their radius at a size similar to the snake and gives them hitpoints like the snake has.\n\nThanks for reviewing the game, hopefully an upcoming patch amends these issues."}],"cursor":"AoJwo8fo6ucCcuv2tQE="}
