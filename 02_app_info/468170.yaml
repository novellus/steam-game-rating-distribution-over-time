    review: "A+\n\nIt's early access and has minute bugs here & there but the devs\
      \ care & are consistently fixing issues with every update. You can tell this\
      \ is a passion project and it's their baby. And thank God! We've NEEDED this\
      \ game to do the [cyberpunk] genre justice since VR's inception and to my opinion\
      \ most all have missed the mark until Doll City. \n\nI've had this game since\
      \ May 2020 and wanted to wait until I had some valuable time in it to see what\
      \ the devs would do over time before I wrote a review. And HOLY F**KING 'ISH!\
      \ Doll City is my VR drug! It's 100%! immersive, trippy, psychedelic, sexy.\
      \ grimy, industrial, and addictive. Great aesthetic, music, and style. Gameplay\
      \ needs a little twerking but has majorly improved since I first strapped on\
      \ back in May. I hope the guys at GaelDK keep building this and move on to bigger\
      \ and better cyberpunk projects for this is not only the foundation of something\
      \ amazing, this game is the foundation of what Cyberpunk in VR is and should\
      \ be. Thank you GaelDK and Infiniverse! If you ever need anyone to test any\
      \ of your projects, I'm more than willing. A+ guys! Cheers! \n\nNeonyx"
