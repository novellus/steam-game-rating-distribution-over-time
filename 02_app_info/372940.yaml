    reviews: "\u201COn the other hand, the presentation of Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen\
      \ is absolutely stunning! The visuals are hands down one of the best we have\
      \ seen in the industry; gorgeous scenery, dimensional graphics, mind-blowing\
      \ cutscenes for instance. The soundtracks are just as impressive, and the majority\
      \ of the voice over is pleasant.\u201D<br>4/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.allaboutcasualgame.com/2015/01/lost-lands-four-horsemen-review.html\"\

      After a boring shopping trip on your way home to make boring dinner for your\
      \ boring kid, you suddenly find yourself whisked away from the parking garage\
      \ to a strange world where you're told by a sexist hermit mage that, though\
      \ he was praying for the &quot;Chosen One&quot; to come defeat the evil plaguing\
      \ the land, you, despite being a &quot;fragile female&quot;, are responsible\
      \ for saving the world. Which seems like a lot to ask for someone wearing red\
      \ pleather and shoulder pads, regardless of gender, but hey. What's this &quot;great\
      \ evil&quot; you ask? Well, it might have something to do with the fiery destruction\
      \ you glimpse being rained down on the very cottage you find yourself standing\
      \ in front of, though that's a future that will only come to pass if you can't\
      \ find a way to stop the flaming swordsman who caused it. With mermaids, halflings,\
      \ portals through space and time, and much more, Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen\
      \ is a satisfyingly epic and lavish fantasy adventure that's perfect for casual\
      \ fans looking for a lot of magic.\u201D<br>not shown \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/review/lost-lands-the-four-horsemen.php\"\
