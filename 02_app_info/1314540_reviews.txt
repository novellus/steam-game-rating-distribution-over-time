I am unsure how to accomplish it but the mouse being the indicator of where you swing your sword isn't that good when you're constantly moving around. A different control scheme would certainly help. A little more content would be nice but for the price it was a pretty decent framework for a game. I would also recommend more sounds for when enemies are hit and different ways to attack. Great start for a game but definitely needs work.","timestamp_created":1590209193,"timestamp_updated":1590209193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wtT2n/ICfJnWiQI="}
