    review: 'I love to use bow and arrow in VR games. This one is a lot of fun. The
      main menu is operated by shooting targets.


      Try to stop the evil Spanish from destroying your temple. You can shoot at the
      enemy directly (helmets and armor are removed first, then you need another arrow
      to actuelly hit your target) or throw bombs that appear on a table in front
      of you.


      There are also vases that explose when hit them placed next to the road.'
