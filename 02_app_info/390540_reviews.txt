The VR menu button still worked, but attepmting to use any option gives no result in the headset. I found that it was displaying the results on the desktop, requiring me to take off the headset, click the option, then put the headset back on.\nAlso constantly loading items, which never seem to appear, so I've not seen the game look like anything shown in the screenshots, only a blueprint like mess.\nThis is a great idea, and I think VR needs something like this, but High Fidelity needs a huge amount of work before it's even useable, let alone enjoyable.\n","timestamp_created":1487369329,"timestamp_updated":1487369329,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505786478519439697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltuHp9oCd+C1cg=="}
