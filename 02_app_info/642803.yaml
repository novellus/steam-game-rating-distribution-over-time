    review: "A must have pack if you are an RhB fan or simply want to collect all\
      \ the RhB stock ( it is kinda the same as being a fan of it, isn't it? ).\n\n\
      Anyway, to be very fair, I'd give this pack a 4 out 5 star rating. The reason\
      \ for this is because I personally would prefer if the sounds were better and\
      \ if there was a bigger amount of \"licensed\" advertisement paints. There's\
      \ so many nice ones on the RhB, it would be nice to have them. \n\nBut even\
      \ besides that, I do recommend getting this pack."
