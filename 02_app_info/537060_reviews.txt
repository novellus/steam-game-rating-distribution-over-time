Obviously the term game is used loosely on Steam in these instances.\n\nControls are easy to use. Has a nice tutorial to explain how to move objects around and style them. The interior looks nice enough and it allows a really good birds eye view with a press of a button. Navigating the birds eye view is done very well but it would be nice to be able to move objects around in that view also. Seems like a good start for an interesting project.","timestamp_created":1486409810,"timestamp_updated":1486409810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492642343044281006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhbi7itoCe6S9cQ=="}
