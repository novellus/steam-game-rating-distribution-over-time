      Rooms: The Main Building requires a lot of cleverness and mental flexibility,\

      From my experience, a good puzzle game makes the player feel clever. It challenges\
      \ and satisfies in equal quantities, and rarely feels frustrating. Rooms: The\
      \ Main Building does all of this, and is genuinely addictive as a result.\u201D\
