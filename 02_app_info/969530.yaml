    review: "This might be a little game at first sight but it offers great \"replayability,\"\
      \ which is a crucial part of the design. It's an RPG Maker game but far from\
      \ your standard fare and in my opinion a better piece than To The Moon. The\
      \ story is an abstract fantasy, which is trying to touch important philosophical\
      \ and ethical questions. Whether it succeeds or not is questionable as is the\
      \ nature of such topics. It certainly cares them well and while the themes might\
      \ feel little forced sometimes, it's never without a taste.\nBesides that I\
      \ would recommend the game for swift gameplay centered around weapons and skills\
      \ tied to them. This makes each playthrough different. Graphics are really nice\
      \ and some of my favourite pixel art i have seen this year. Especially the colours\
      \ are very well selected. \nAnd man, I love the soundtrack. It's where the game\
      \ really shines. Somewhere among classic rock, Carpenter's synths and 16-bit\
      \ fantasy games, it hits the sweet spot and just rocks."
