      the privilege of regents, and an Indian rummy couldn't play it. Nowadays, you
      can play chess and feel like a king! Learn the rules, practice and become invincible
      in this game of logic.

    review: "Total dog crap. \n-There is no multiplayer. \n-The CPU moved their queen\
      \ adjacent to my king and would not let me kill the queen with my king despite\
      \ it not resulting in the king being in danger. \n\nGo watch cat videos on Youtube\
      \ instead."
