      /><br>This game is a passion project that started out as programming sandbox
      in college which eventually grew into the full experience it is today. It was
      built over the course of many long years and is designed to be a chaotic burst
      of action with an aesthetic that throws back to a previous generation. <br><br>Vanguard
      is a high speed, arcade style, 3D shooter. Prepare to speed through a carefully
      crafted experience that will push your precision, reaction, and timing abilities
      in order to weave through obstacles and enemy attacks. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/652890/extras/stp-1.png?t=1574869265"
      /><br>Engage in frantic dogfights, massive bosses, and  use a plethora of cutting
      edge weapons in order to defend what is left of your home world. <br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/652890/extras/stp-2.png?t=1574869265"
      /><br>The action for the game will fall into two categories. The first is an
      on-rail mode where the goal is simply to survive to the end while destroying
      as many enemies as possible. The second  is a all-range combat mode where the
      player is free to move any direction they chose in order to navigate an environment
      and take down enemies as they see fit.
