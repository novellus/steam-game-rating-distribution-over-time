There's a foundation of a halfway-decent game here, if it had more content to it. Instead, High Noon employs cheap tricks to stretch out its content far past its welcome, and these make its other flaws even more unbearable. \n\n[b]ಠ_ಠ Progression is a grind.[/b]\nEvery enemy in this game has a health bar that your weapons deplete. Even headshots aren't enough to kill enemies if your weapon isn't a high enough level. You're forced to accumulate cash for upgrades, but this progression takes far too long and requires repeating levels - especially if you don't specialize in one choice of weapon or another.\n\nIf the game didn't have this grind, you'd blow through its levels in 45 minutes and then immediately request a steam refund of your $10. Obviously, we can't have that.\n\n[b]ಠ_ಠ There's no mechanics for cover, dodging, or other damage mitigation beyond shooting.[/b]\nFights in this game are effectively a DPS (Damage per Second) race - you need to blow away enemies' health bars before they take yours out. There's no way of mitigating damage aside from shooting threats - no use of cover or moving your body, which is a terrible waste of roomscale VR's potential.\n\n[b]ಠ_ಠ Enemy design is dull and their voice acting is uninspired.[/b]\nOnly a half-dozen different character models in the game exist, with a boring palette swap of their clothing colors. After you fight a boss in one stage, they become mooks in the next one for you to stomp on. You'll occasionally hear a \"Hey, you!\" from the 'sexy' female enemies. What fun.\n\n[b]ಠ_ಠ The narrator sounds like a sexist basement dweller.[/b]\nBetween badly reading western romance novel text in the shopping stage, to calling the women 'skanks', the narration of this game is unredeemable trash. The developer's response was to add a mute button for him and call it fixed, when honestly, these narration files should have just been deleted outright.\n\n[b]Bottom-line, this game isn't worth buying, even at sale rates.[/b]\nIf you're looking for a simple, Western-themed wave shooter, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/685690/GunsnStories_Bulletproof_VR/]Guns'n'Stories[/url] easily beats out this game for the same price point on every single aspect. There's no ridiculous grind, higher quality enemies, and a far less obnoxious narrator. Plus, it features a demo.\n\n[quote]\n[b]For more reviews like this one, follow the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38513044/]ಠ_ಠ Reviews Curator page.[/url][/b]\nSpecializing in brutally honest critique of VR and Engineering games.\n[/quote]","timestamp_created":1608589174,"timestamp_updated":1608589174,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz9zYw/YCeaiFvAI="}
