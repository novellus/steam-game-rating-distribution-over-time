It is also bug-free.\n\nThe rest of the content is more of an inconvenience than an enhancement and throws the game way out of balance.\n\nThe towns you start in are now randomly sized. So if you've got your clan members set up a certain way to be in homes and so on, when you end that game and kick off a new world half of your clan members are outside the walls. So either you have to spend time messing with their positions, or more likely you won't realize they have moved until the first monster invasion kills some or all of them.\n\nA couple of the new clans are OP in my opinion.\n\nBut the worst part is the orcs. They completely take over the game. \n\nA randomly placed orc raid using a dimension gate can be far stronger than anything an opposing clan might throw at you. They'll send raids of 25 orcs which are 10 levels higher than your clan. It's hopeless when this happens.\n\nThere are these orc scouts, which are summoners. Each summons can bring in around 5-7 orc berzerkers, which are strong, fast melee units. There can be many orc scouts on a single level, so you can start to get a picture of how this ends up going. Orc scouts can make an area absolutely impassable - new orcs can be summoned as fast as you can kill them, so either you wind up dead if you get surrounded, or there are simply so many orcs that you can't physically kill them all.\n\nOrcs, basically generic monsters, in this DLC are not only are capable of wiping out clans, but they often kill everything on the level that isn't an orc. So if you get a quest for say, dread warrior skulls and they share a level with orcs, you might have to redo the level several times because the orcs will wipe out the dread warriors before you can reach them. Even if you don't have a quest like that, the game often becomes a grind where you're mowing down thousands of orcs. \n\nI love the base game, but this DLC takes more than it gives.","timestamp_created":1526422782,"timestamp_updated":1596428315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l92i2fMCeo64oAE="}
