    about_the_game: In 199X, you control Clara. That's the problem.<br><br>The doctors
      say she's delusional, but you both know that can't be true. The two of you need
      to explore Delilah, the town where Clara lives. You need to navigate her messy,
      personal relationships. Most of all, you need to find a cure. And beat the game.
      <br><br>199X is a 2-3 hour narrative adventure, split into seven playable days.
      It is written by Evan Tognotti, and features a full-length original soundtrack
      from acoustic weirdo Kearney. <br><br><strong>Play 199X. Help you help herself.</strong><br><br><br>---<br><br><strong><br>WHAT
      PEOPLE ARE SAYING</strong><br><br>&quot;199X advertises itself as a 'game without
      mechanics,' which is probably because it is another crappy Steam Greenlight
      game made in RPG Maker. It is a 'lightly interactive' game (aka players basically
      press the arrow keys) and features a whooping one protagonist. Again, this is
      because this is a horrible excuse for a 'game' made using a horrible excuse
      for a 'game engine.' Not only that, but the developer of this game has the utter
      gall to charge for this couple hour 'interactive experience.' Although is (sic)
      is only $2 US, it is still disgusting people are being charged for this crap.&quot;
      - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://Lusipurr.com" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"  >Lusipurr.com</a><br><br>&quot;There is also quite a bit of
      social justice in this game which makes parts feel a little bit like a (sic)
      'educational game' or propaganda... don't expect any male characters to have
      any depth or role in the plot, it's all about the ladies and the male characters
      are there for window dressing.&quot; - <strong>A Steam reviewer</strong>
