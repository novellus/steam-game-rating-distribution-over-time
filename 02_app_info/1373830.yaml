      \ damage, but slowly heating up the reactor.<br></li><li> Get back your lost\
      \ health (structure) by blasting your way through the enemy defenses and wrecking\

      \ and human error.<br></li><li> The AI also knows how to defend, but can be\
      \ beaten in a dogfight, by flanking, right timing, or sometimes with a good,\
      \ old bullet storm.<br></li><li> Very high DPS means a lot of healing, even\
      \ over your limit. All ships yours including have very effective life stealing\

    short_description: SPL is a genre mix of fast paced shooter, souls-like and 3D
      space sim, with realistic physics dogfights. The game respects the players time
      at it's core, delivering the most in the given moments. Join a hopeless struggle,
      against a cosmic entity threatening all sentient life.

    review: This is quite an unpolished gem. The game jumps from combat to combat,
      bringing back memories of dogfights in Freespace 2. Positioning and timing matter
      more than raw damage numbers. The dev is quick to respond to feedback, and keeps
      adding much-needed content.
