    review: 'Fun, cheap game with awesome creativity and gameplay.

      Like how the difficulty keeps getting harder and harder as you advance through
      the stages.

      Amazingly slick and well made! If you like to challenge yourself, then this
      game is perfect for you.

      Overall 10/10'
