It's all over the news:\n[i]You've been kidnapped.[/i]\nBut... you are right here and very much not-kidnapped. There's just one, very horrifying explanation:\nThe person in the ransom video is your identical twin. Worse yet, there's a great chance they are the city's very own masked vigilante: The Swashbuckler.\nIf you want to save your twin before the kidnappers find out that they do not have you, but the Swashbuckler in their clutches, and might act accordingly (aka likely killing your twin), the only chance you have is to take up the mask and cape yourself, find and rescue your twin, discover how they got kidnapped... and all of that before the wedding.\n\nThe plot, world and characters are wonderfully crafted, and with a lot of Aha!- and Oh!-moments. Every new play-through can easily provide information and scenes not witnessed in one before, like the backstories of the NPCs, villains included.\n\nThus, one of the best (superhero) stories in the library, great replay value.","timestamp_created":1583436666,"timestamp_updated":1583436666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwycKL1vACfZml9gE="}
