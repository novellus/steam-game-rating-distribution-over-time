Hell no. I got it on sale for $3, still not worth it. It's honestly more of a free game. I will be getting a refund so I could buy better games rather than a game where you just repeat the same stuff over and over again. I played this game for 47 minutes/close to an hour and I STILL found myself repeating same stuff. STILL. There is also no actual nudity nor sexual content in the game. So basically, the description was lying. Don't buy this game. Especially for 10 nor 3 dollars.","timestamp_created":1609025228,"timestamp_updated":1610071238,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw16zu7/YCe43HvQI="}
