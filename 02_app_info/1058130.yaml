    review: "Finished now. My thoughts? A lot of stuff is glossed over with the final\
      \ 'good' ending. What feels like some simple steps that could have been taken\
      \ to clean everything up over the course of the game pretty much gets swept\
      \ under the rug with these Nisse at end game. We find out that one of the primary\
      \ effects of Elixer is madness but the Nisse seem to completely bypass that\
      \ side effect out of nowhere, despite being 'human.'\n\nThe game is still full\
      \ of a bunch of magics the player will never be allowed to touch, besides macguffins\
      \ like the portal.\n\nFighter based weapons/armor is utter crap compared to\
      \ 90% of the arcane gear available. The weapons themselves seem to be poorly\
      \ thought out and/or implemented to the degree that no found or quested weapon\
      \ will be better than the stuff you can buy in the forts eventually (one exception\
      \ are the orb shields which leave even the magical tower shield in the dust\
      \ and another is Fool's Shot), Effects are rarely clear+documented, Time Warp\
      \ would have been amazing if the guy who would have used it could have benefited\
      \ from the evasion boost. As it is, there was no point so it was shit. still\
      \ not sure if it was supposed to have a 20% crit range. Fools shot should have\
      \ had a chance to confuse EVERYONE on the field, not just my party members,\
      \ but is otherwise the best bow available despite being 'cursed' so long as\
      \ your guys have solid metal resistance. \n\nOverall, like it enough that I\
      \ plan on doing Spidweb the courtesy of paying full price for the second one\
      \ when it comes out, though I'll be expecting the kinks in the system to have\
      \ been ironed out (at end game there were WAY too many potions/charms in my\
      \ pack compared to free slots for carrying loot; there needs to be some kind\
      \ of stacking available for scrolls and potions of a like nature). That and\
      \ a place to be easily told when i'm above any bonus limits, as well as how\
      \ much i'm over.\n\n\n\n\n-------old review below\nThis is getting a recommendation\
      \ early because spidweb usually delivers good stuff. What i see of it is a little\
      \ simplistic, but it seems to have that extra touch when it comes to the world\
      \ map and exploration that was always awesome.\n\nYou can definitely see more\
      \ of an influence of tactical games on hand.\n\nAbout the only criticism I have\
      \ so far is with this soldier 'Cacambo' whose fate you can decide. You can decide\
      \ to send him home, flog him, or put him back in the unit one of two ways. But,\
      \ I don't get the choice of leveling with him that we're stuck here too. While\
      \ giving him one of two choices: 1) He goes back to his company and finishes\
      \ his year of service before he can go home, guaranteed. or 2) He swears personal\
      \ service to you the MC and can leave when you leave, though you should also\
      \ be able to get a message and payment through to have his family and lands\
      \ taken care of in the mean time."
