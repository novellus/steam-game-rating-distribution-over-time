    review: 'Let me preface this with a statement of support towards Finalbossblues,
      I''ve been a fan of the Time Fantasy tileset since its initial release and have
      steadily been purchasing them, and never had issues until now. The previous
      sets are great and definitely worth it if you are interested in this particular
      art style.


      Now onto the Farm and Fort set.

      The tilesets for the actual forts and farms themselves are great, and of the
      same quality as every other release for Time Fantasy. The icons, however are
      not. Included in this DLC is multiple size formats for the icon set (also the
      reason I believe this DLC is the price it is, almost 5.00 CAD more than the
      other tilesets). These icon sets are the proper sizes for every rpg maker EXCEPT
      for VX Ace. I''ve spent quite a while trying to fit them into my project, and
      not a single size (including the size that is listed as the intended VX Ace
      iconset) functioned. I''ve had to end up making my own icon set from the ground
      up, resizing everything and as a result lowering the quality of the icons to
      fit the game. I would not recommend it if you are interested in the icon sets
      for VX ACE (others seem perfectly fine), as you will not find what you are looking
      for. Hopefully I can change this review to a recommendation in the future, but
      as of 7/5/2018 it will remain a thumbs down.'
