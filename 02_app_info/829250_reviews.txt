It's not easy, it's not intuitive, there is no tutorial, and the \"how to play\" text is vague and short.\n\nThe main issue, however, is that it is slow. Sloth slow. You'll spend a good 10 minutes clicking every 5-10 seconds to gather the resources needed to build up an army, and that assumes you know exactly what resources you need and exactly what to craft. Oh, and if your army dies at any point, you have to start over from scratch, even if you have more than enough resources to train more troops.\n\nThis game is extremely tedious and frustrating. You'd have to have the patience of Job to even tolerate it. Its merits once you get past its multitude of shortcomings, but unless you're a masochistic achievement hound, give it a pass.","timestamp_created":1595915693,"timestamp_updated":1595970043,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x8fOy/MCdtuAmAI="}
