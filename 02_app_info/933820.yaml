    review: "tl;dr As many folks have said in their reviews, this game is very much\
      \ like Banished. If you enjoyed Banished, you will enjoy this game. I have found\
      \ it easily as enjoyable, if not more so, than Banished, and the game is still\
      \ in Early Access. As the developers complete more of the game and gradually\
      \ move it to full release, I have no doubt that I will easily consider it the\
      \ superior of the two.\n\nMany of the systems are very similar if not outright\
      \ the same. You can hunt, gather, farm, fish, or raise animals for food. You\
      \ must concern yourself with tools and clothing. Your people need shelter and\
      \ medicine. \n\nHowever, I have found many of the systems to either be deeper,\
      \ more realistic, or entirely new systems that make the game more engaging.\
      \ \n\nDeeper: In addition to food, your people now also need water, and water\
      \ is used for many things: drinking, irrigation, producing certain goods, watering\
      \ animals at your pastures. \n\nMore realistic: In Banished you could easily\
      \ sustain huge populations on hunting, gathering, and fishing. In Endzone, working\
      \ fields and orchards is VERY MUCH a key to sustaining food production, rather\
      \ than just a way to bump food diversity. Success at farming was a key achievement\
      \ that allowed switching from a nomadic to an agrarian lifestyle.\n\nNew: Dealing\
      \ with radiation (in addition to disease) in both the soil, rain, water/food\
      \ supplies. There's a tech tree that you must progress through in order to unlock\
      \ more buildings. There are side-quests/goals that citizens will occasionally\
      \ give you (and a building you can construct to more reliably access these).\
      \ Electricity use and production is a thing. You can send folks out to scout\
      \ old world ruins and explore them with teams to recover goods.\n\nThere's a\
      \ pretty robust tutorial to explain how everything works, as well as scenarios\
      \ (which I have not yet attempted, myself) and survival mode, which is effectively\
      \ how one always played Banished: Your goal is to survive and thrive, not complete\
      \ specific objectives (outside of achievement hunting I suppose).\n\nIf I had\
      \ to say anything negative, I'm not a huge fan of the sound track. Parts of\
      \ it are pretty good, but I find it a bit too repetitive, and certain parts\
      \ are simply jarring to listen to, nevermind when they repeat frequently. I've\
      \ also encountered a few minor issues such as a \"missing string\" error when\
      \ an explorer was supposed to say something to me on an expedition."
