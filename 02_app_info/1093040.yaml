    review: "This is a must buy if your a Star Trek fan and you really enjoy modern\
      \ pinball tables because Star Trek  Vengeance has it all. Colored LED lights\
      \ that go from Red to green to purple. Its a really nice show. This pinball\
      \ table also has a ton of missions that are fun and mostly on the easy side\
      \ to do. I think its a much better table then Star Trek the next generation\
      \ table.  I would buy this pack just for Star Trek alone. It also has voices\
      \ from the movies. Just a real treat to play. \n\nFrankenstein is a good table\
      \ but it yells at the player a lot. It got on my nerves after some time. Flight\
      \ 2000 is an old school table its not bad but its a slower paced table. Ripleys\
      \ is a solid table and well worth playing. A very interesting game. Starship\
      \ Troopers looks great however the small flippers and the balls wants to drain\
      \ almost on a constant basis. I owned most of these table except for Star Trek\
      \ Vengeance and I feel like its a bargain. I would have spent more on that playing\
      \ the real thing. This is currently on sale for $3.74 and that is a good bargain."
