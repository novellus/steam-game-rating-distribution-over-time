Early heritage diesel fan? Interested in Scottish rolling stock? Then you'll like this (or at least how it exists). Otherwise, unless you're looking for more content for the Port Road DLC, it's not a must-buy.\n\nFor the seasoned enthusiast, the first annoying hurdle will be the sound. I'm not a seasoned enthusiast, but watching the video back I noticed the engine sounds are a bit too generic. I'm not clued up enough to deduce exactly why they were generic, but you'll understand if you've driven other TS diesel locomotives.\n\nFor outsiders who are looking for an interesting new simulation experience, you won't find it here. Out of the box, you get two very basic scenarios (passenger services Stranraer Harbour/Newton Stewart and Carlisle Citadel/Dumfries with basic AI movements). There are obviously plenty more to choose from in the Workshop, however most of these are limited to the Port Road route because of the single livery supplied. It would have been nice to see a BR Blue livery at least? We could have got some more realistic West Highland Line scenarios then...\n\nIf you've come here for a specific reason, you'll be moderately pleased, which is why I've recommended this. Looking for a new experience? Nah, don't bother.","timestamp_created":1586896766,"timestamp_updated":1586896766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww+CavfECcLvngAI="}
