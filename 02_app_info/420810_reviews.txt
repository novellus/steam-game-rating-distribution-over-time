It's fun to listen too, and fits gameplay perfectly, but whilst playing the game I got so hooked to the game I wanted to listen to them on my phone, so here I am. After buying It I thought where the soundtrack was saved too, and if your wondering the directory is: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Rubber Ducky and the Rainbow Gun\\Soundtrack\". The music is great and I recommend buying this, and the game.","timestamp_created":1470427951,"timestamp_updated":1470427951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473933637142181396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+b2VrtYCccSrXg=="}
