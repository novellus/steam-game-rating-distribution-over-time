    review: "Only recommended in the DLC sales I'm afraid. \n\nThe good points:\n\
      The model is nice looking and looks well made. I do like the cabview including\
      \ the gimmick pie in the oven that gives this pack a bit of a sense of humour\
      \ in my opinion. There is a couple of career scenarios included and a set of\
      \ brown and cream mk1 carriages to match the Class 35 Hymek. But that is where\
      \ the fun factors end with this pack which is a shame as this can be a great\
      \ add-on if the following issues are corrected which I have covered below.\n\
      \nThe bad points:\nThe handling is a bit unpredictable as its \"all or nothing\"\
      \ when applying the brakes on the locomotive and this can mean the difference\
      \ between stopping at the station successfully or overshooting the platform.\
      \ The brakes do need to be tweaked so that the brake force isn't erratic. But\
      \ the tipping point for me and this issue is what really kills the enjoyment\
      \ of this add-on is the \"Hybrid\" sounds because the sounds that come with\
      \ this locomotive are terrible and sound absolutely nothing like a real Class\
      \ 35 Hymek when it chugs along with that Maybach musical note from its supercharger.\
      \ The sounds are like a hybrid of a Class 20 and a Class 37 remixed and blended\
      \ into each other and its not suitable for this locomotive. There is really\
      \ no excuse because there is a couple of these actual locomotives in preservation\
      \ such as the East Lancashire Railway and perhaps a recording session should\
      \ be arranged so that this pack has some authentic sounds from the real locomotive\
      \ as intended. \n\nVerdict:\nThe full price is \xA311.99 isn't worth it due\
      \ to the poor handling and the terrible hybrid sounds. So its only recommended\
      \ in the Steam sales for the time being and would make a nice AI train. I do\
      \ hope that the creator of this pack will record some proper Hymek sounds and\
      \ make an update in the future to an otherwise very good and well made Class\
      \ 35 locomotive. So there is lots of potential to make this into a great pack\
      \ if these issues are addressed.\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10."
