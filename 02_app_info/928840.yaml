      Cybarian aims to be an Arcade-like game, and I'd say they've done a fairly good\
      \ job at that goal. It's a fun challening hybrid of a 2D Platformer and a Beat-m-Up,\
      \ punishing you when you fail the timing-based combat and also sending you back\
      \ to the start upon death unless you've reached the boss. It took some getting\
      \ used to at first, but I did enjoy the combat overall due to it not being a\
      \ simple button masher. The combat did also get some upgrades after each stage,\
      \ though it made the fights a bit too easy in my opinion. The stages were also\
      \ fun to go through, albeit a bit short and also linear, but they did all have\
      \ their own gimmicks. But being a bit short is also one of my main issues with\
      \ the game as a whole, as it can easily be beaten in an hour or less depending\
      \ on skill. There is nothing else to do aside from the campaign, so when you've\
      \ finished the game in that short amount of time, you're pretty much done unless\
      \ you're an achievement hunter (which are satanic on Steam btw). There is a\
      \ lot of potential in this game, but due to the short time and simplicity, none\
      \ truly reach the potential they deserve. Despite being a time-travelling warrior\
      \ for example, the main protagonist only goes to one era. It's literally just\
      \ a barberian in a cyber-punk timeline, and that's it. Coins have no other functionality\
      \ than buying hearts either. I'm fine with simplicity, but this game took it\
      \ a bit too far and while I certainly enjoyed the game, it's not one that I'll\
      \ revisit anytime soon. I would definitely be interested in a sequel however!\n\
