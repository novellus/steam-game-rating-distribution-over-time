      re willing to sacrifice to complete your current goal</li></ul><br>Since Z.\
      \ is a single-player game that takes a bit of inspiration from rogue-likes,\
      \ the Hardcore/Variant system allows players access to extremely powerful cards:\
      \ units gain better stats and new abilities; Traps and Actions cost less to\
      \ play or become more devastating; and Heroes and Horrors can be played much\
      \ earlier than in Standard, completing changing the flow of the game!<br><br>There\u2019\

      \ a look and we hope to hear from you in the forums!<br><br><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>\
      \ Z. Year One is a standalone product -- the entire game is included already,\
      \ with no additional purchases or microtransactions required. There are currently\
      \ no plans for DLC or expansion sets, etc. It's more like Duels of the Planeswalker\
      \ and less like Hearthstone in this way, as the development team consists primarily\

    review: "while this game seems like it has potental (and with less than an hour\
      \ i dont really feel that ive given it a fair go) im going to request a refund.\
      \ my internet is spotty at best (it took over four hours to download this) and\
      \ you have to log in in order to play the single player game, which i thought\
      \ might be the case when i saw the third party verification thing on the side\
      \ of the store page. if that was the only thing that would be fine, but unless\
      \ i missed a speed setting this games actions are super slow. also on occasion\
      \ my cursor stops lining up with the card im on or trying to go to. that might\
      \ be difficult to understand so let me put it a different way; the arrow cursor\
      \ is lined up with the card on the right side of the screen but the card 2 things\
      \ to the left gets highlighted. \nthe art is awesome though\n"
