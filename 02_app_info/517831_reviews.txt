This game has like...one of the BEST zombies IMO, but now the game is flat out broken. I was fine for the first couple hours of gameplay, but then all of a sudden, every zombies game I booted up would:\n1. Not let me skip the intro cutscenes\n2. Would black screen and crash EVERYTIME I went through the stupid zombie cutscenes.\nAnd with no way to fix it really anywhere except for turning off my anti-virus (Which didn't work btw) I decided to give up on this game. Activision support hasn't done shit to help me so I'm tired of giving this game a chance","timestamp_created":1591889936,"timestamp_updated":1591889936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6JeC0vICcJm5jQI="}
