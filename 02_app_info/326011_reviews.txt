They come with different loads and even the empties have a liittle bit leftover load in them. \n\nAn unexpected surprise is you get an extra free pack with this add-on. This conains Temporary Speed Restriction 'TSR' warning boards, portable AWS magnate and warning lights for scenario making but to top it off is that the manual also provides a few links that shows you how to use them correctly.\n\nCertainly a worthwhile buy.\n","timestamp_created":1505415741,"timestamp_updated":1505415741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45KfxwN4CcvurhQE="}
