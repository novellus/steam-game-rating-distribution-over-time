The game is not very challenging in the grand scheme of SHMUP / Bullet Hell games and has little to no replay value, but I did find myself chugging through its brisk 20-30 minutes of gameplay and enjoying what it had to offer. The game itself degenerates a bit into \"mashing the teleport / dodge button as you race up the screen\" (the game is a vertical scrolling SHMUP) to progress to the next section of the level, but I still enjoyed it for what it offered. \n\nThere isn't a whole lot to say about this game. There are a variety of random pickups to be had, one set of which affect the pattern of your firing / shooting and the other providing effects such as mini tornadoes that spawn out of your ... creature? tank? aircraft? Just what exactly ARE you on this game? (It looks like a creepy Thomas the Tank Engine...) -anyway, the other pickups are AOE type effects that last for a limited time, while the other set of pickups affect your firing pattern. Some of these were a little too similar to one another (a blue and purple variant of a scattershot being the worst offenders) however there are about 7 total to be found, which lend to a decent variety. The game also includes seemingly random \"bomb\" / screen-clearing effects that you can use if you have enough MP, so all of the staples of SHMUP gameplay are present. \n\nELDR LEGACY includes a set of 5 levels each with their own unique music, backgrounds, and bosses to defeat. While none of the bosses had particularly engaging combat patterns (a lot of it is just kiting around similar-looking patterns..) I did appreciate the introduction to each level and its mystic content. \n\nThe game features annoying line / paragraph breaks in its writing betwe\nen levels which make readi\nng it very awk\nward as if the translation was o\nff and they didn't know w\nhat format the final game would be taki\nng. \n\nLong story short, if you like funky / strange SHMUPs with an Eastern tinge to their content, music, or enemy design you'll probably enjoy this game, however at its very short total playtime (plus infinite lives seemingly?) and lack of much replay value at all (as well as lack of co-op) it's hard to suggest to anyone beyond fans of the niche content and genre. For those players, you'll probably enjoy its short runtime.\n\n\n-edit- Oh, and the enemies that shoot out the yellow balls that trap you and drag you back down the screen are annoying af!! -_-","timestamp_created":1555654606,"timestamp_updated":1555655029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562557339668273926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kP6QmuoCcOTEvwE="}
