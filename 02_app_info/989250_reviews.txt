This game is the reason that videogames are linked to school shootings, and that is an outright fact. \n\nOverall, I found the gameplay to be meaninglessly difficult alongside unnatractive visuals, as well as a disgustingly written and developed plotline which personally made me fill up my personal vomit bag.\n\nThe movie SAW couldn't make me afraid of saws, but level 6 did - FUCK LEVEL 6.\n\n2.75 spikes/10 spikes per saw (so many saws).","timestamp_created":1582492936,"timestamp_updated":1582492936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501742184162139893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Lz7ufACfq2Z9AE="}
