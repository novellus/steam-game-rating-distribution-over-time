For anyone looking for more thoughtful puzzles of this sort to go through, this is one of the better options available on Steam right now. \n\n[i]Depixtion[/i] requires an adjustment compared to other nonogram puzzle games; the grid is split up by 4 instead of by 5, and the nature of using two different colors within a single image changes how one approaches putting a line onto the grid. Where some may find that off-putting, however, I found these changes to be refreshing in how they forced me to look at the board in a new light each and every time I sat down to do a puzzle. It kept me on my toes all throughout. \n\nWhile some snags come along the way - a couple puzzles toward the middle are somewhat grindy, and some puzzles accidentally leave you with the wrong solution because the labelled numbers give you a different solution than is intended - this game is still a total delight. I’d be happy to see more puzzles come along for this, whether that be through workshop support, an update, or another DLC pack. I was definitely itching to go through more puzzles even after the dozens that I’d already gone through - something that’s always a sign of a truly enjoyable video game experience. \n\n9.0/10","timestamp_created":1606810182,"timestamp_updated":1606810182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl7TWjvYCeYGktgI="}
