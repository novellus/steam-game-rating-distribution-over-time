    about_the_game: 'This DLC includes another <strong>five beautiful skins</strong>
      that will make your creations look fantastic. <br>The skins are: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gooey
      - slimy surface for that sticky look<br></li><li>High Tech - for an electronic
      surface<br></li><li>Scales - just what you need when building dragons<br></li><li>Non-Slip
      - watch your step!<br></li><li>Rivets - For the armored submarine</li></ul><br>Each
      skin can be modified to your desired colors.<br><br>Purchasing the Skin Pack
      supports the development of Trailmakers and future games from Flashbulb. Thanks
      for the support :)<br>  <br>The skins can be applied to the following blocks:
      Block 1x2, Block 1x3, Block 1x4, Block 2x4, Block 2x2x2, Block 4x8, Cylinder
      1x1x2, Shield Plates, and all the blocks in the Aerodynamic Category.<br>  <br>The
      skins do not change the physical properties of the blocks in the game - it is
      purely a cosmetic change. Players who do not own this DLC cannot edit a vehicle
      that uses the skins, but they can still take the vehicle for a drive. To edit
      a vehicle that uses a block skin you do not own, you must either remove the
      blocks that uses the block skins or purchase them for yourself.<br><br><img
