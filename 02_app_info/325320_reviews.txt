The combat system, is good, and despite what quite a few people say, it is easy, if you know how to use the different skills toward different enemies. And for God's sake: use 'GUARD' action.. You replenish your action points and your health as well as you get a defence bonus for the 1 turn used on it (i think) It makes all the difference. I love the game, actually, the story is very intriguing, it is lovably oldschool, the graphics is dated, but how many people love games that are dated graphically? MANY, all say the dont make games as they used to. And that is true. And this game, is a great one. Niche for sure, but I like games that are investigating and requires the player to use his or her mind on this. And you have to use your head on this game. I really love it, it is a great RPG, and within the Chtulu mythos, it aint to many proper Lovecraft games out there, but this is one. RECOMMENDED! OH and Kudos to RPG GAMEMAKER, i guess Mythos: The Beginning is made in either VX or MV, it is a great programming software, and this game does the gamemaker real credit.","timestamp_created":1576742394,"timestamp_updated":1576742394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53147733211517334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwifPKju8Cffuk5QE="}
