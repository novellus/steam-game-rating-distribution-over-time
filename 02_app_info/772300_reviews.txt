No matter what you do your character always seems to gravitate toward an \"interest\" in drinking even if you choose not to over and over, furthermore the game throws an almost superfluous amount of opportunities to get \"physical\" with the gender/s you're attracted to (Granted we aren't talking about full on descriptive \"scenes\" more just a glossed over \"you did that\" but it seemed a bit tasteless how often one of the choices in a social situation was to bed someone.). The stats are fairly odd and don't quite seem to link up with the narrative (EG: My starting stats listed \"blood alcohol level: Intoxicated\" yet they were moving, talking, and operating tools with no problem) and even redoing character creation a few times the lowest I managed to get for that particular stat was \"tipsy\" from the beginning, there was also a distinct lack of a \"here are your stats, are you happy with them or would you like to redo them?\" option at the end of character creation. I've only played through it once so far but a fair few of the decisions I made in my play-through felt as is they had no real bearing on anything. I got this on a discount during a sale and I still wouldn't recommend it\n\nEdit: I've now noticed my play time and thought I should clarify, yes it's still only one play through but I forgot to close the game when I left to go do some stuff in town","timestamp_created":1609655960,"timestamp_updated":1609656027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ497i+4/YCeOz9vwI="}
