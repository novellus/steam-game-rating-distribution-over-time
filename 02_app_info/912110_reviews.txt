Seems to combine hidden object games with point-and-click adventures. Visually beautiful. The game has a bit of a Myst feel sometimes, especially with the lack of characters and the creepy ambience. Some of the hidden-object areas are a bit flawed, however. I was just in an area where there was a partially-torn box that turned out to need to be cut with a knife. There was a pair of shoes that needed laces that turned out to be the \"boots\" I needed. When I hovered my cursor over the letter, it said it couldn't be sent. I encountered a stamp. It seemed logical, so I brought it over and I got the same message. I clicked anyway and it worked. Another thing I don't like is the cursor for \"this does not work\" is two moving gears, something you would more associate with loading. I have also encountered some typos: \"The letter is sticked to the wall\". The voice acting, what little there is, is awful, but at least you don't have to talk to the characters that often. In one room I had to find the hand bell, but it wouldn't acknowledge that I had clicked on it unless I clicked on the handle, causing confusion. One thing I appreciate is that you can only make seven wrong clicks before you are prevented from clicking for five seconds, preventing you from rapidly clicking everywhere until you find everything. You can get disoriented sometimes due to the change of camera angles after you change location, such as when you go from the stockroom to the bridge: you press down. Pressing down again once you get to the bridge takes you back.","timestamp_created":1535869656,"timestamp_updated":1606710751,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462107211351394653","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48Y3bi/YCfYbsqQE="}
