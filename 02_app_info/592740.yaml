    review: "this game costs too much for what it's worth it took me 10 minutes to\
      \ learn the controles because there is no help took me a while to figure out\
      \ how to land on a island with the wood pulp item you start with could just\
      \ call it a makeshift oar  but no wood pulp \nof the 5 worlds i made 2 didnt\
      \ spawn with it 1 without a knife food or water and the last two i got one pineapple\
      \ one cola a knife the wood pulp and the fishing rod on one\nwhen i finally\
      \ landed on a island i tryed to move and  i didnt move but i took food water\
      \ and health  when going north west or southgoing east put me back in the ocean\
      \ without allowing me to explore the island\nfor some reason pressing the w\
      \ key drains your food water and health\nso refine the game and some sort of\
      \ help for people make the game free and finally\nI WANT MY MONEY BACK."
