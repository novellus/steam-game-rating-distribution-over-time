Technically, it's a mediocre game that can be finished in 15 minutes, but at the same time it's a nice short art project that looks like a prologue to a bunch of upcoming releases from Oddfellows Software that are expected to be launched on Steam next year (and I hope that they will be much stronger than this one).\n\nNecronomistore's gameplay mechanics is even too simple: working as a cashier, player have to sort the objects appearing on the screen by two categories: good (\"goes to the bag\") and bad (\"goes to the bin\"). The process of sorting consists in exposing the objects to the sorting monitor which shows their mentioned quality (you have to drag the objects to the specific spot on the screen). Every successful act of sorting brings points to the player, and to proceed to the next level they have to surpass the specific number of points under pressure of time. And that's all, like in some kind of Flash game from the mid-2000's.\n\nFrankly, there is not enough of content in Necronomistore to cost $1.39 - it got only four levels with repetitive gameplay that are fused together by unclear plotline (that fells like a first chapter of a bigger story). On the other hand, if you like chaotic expressionistic art-style from the screenshots, you won't be disappointed if you'll buy the game on a Steam sale - clunky but stylish visual design is the main attraction of the project (together with the atmosphere of surreal randomness - alas, the game is too short to fully reveal the potential of it). \n\nVerdict: if you're looking for a \"good game\", I can't recommend it, but as a test project before something bigger Necronomistore looks great. If you're searching for weird Steam releases with casual gameplay, that's the one you may like - at least for its wacky yet stylish visual design.","timestamp_created":1573647053,"timestamp_updated":1573647066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50151979923248291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuZSrsu4CfqTm2QE="}
