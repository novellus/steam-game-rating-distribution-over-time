    review: 'UPDATE - 7/23/20 - Unfortunately, it seems this game has been completely
      abandoned by its developer.  The game crashes every time I try to save, rendering
      it unplayable.  Sadly the game itself is pretty good, but not worth buying.


      ---



      A solid operational hex-and-counter wargame, if a bit clunky and fiddly.  It''s
      a lite version of something like GG: War in the East or Decisive Campaigns:
      Barbarossa, covering the entire Eastern Front from 1941-1945 with 1-month turns.  Once
      you get a hang of the UI, the game is a straightforward chit-shuffler.  Barbarroja
      is much quicker to play than GG or DC, and benefits from an option for custom
      unit placement, which adds a lot to replayability.  Speaking of replayability,
      there''s a decent number of scenarios covering smaller snippets of the war,
      plus a fairly flexible scenario editor.  The AI is sneaky and competent, although
      the Soviets are unusually aggressive in the initial turns of the 41-45 campaign.


      Recommended for fans of hex-and-counter wargames and Eastern Front fanatics
      in general.


      Fair warning:  I''m currently having issues with frequent CTDs caused by saving
      the game and even clicking "No" on the end-turn save prompt.  I''ve opened a
      thread about this and will remove this from my review as soon as it gets fixed.'
