    review: 'This is a true love letter to Megaman X!

      = Pros =

      + The setting/level design is creative, no two levels look alike

      + The controls are responsive, platforming is fun but challenging, making you
      deserve your boss fights

      + The ennemies are varied and all require patience/strategy to take out

      + Weapons don''t have ammunition, instead they act as balanced tools to exploit
      the ennemies pattern

      + The cutscenes are surprisingly fun to read, making the story interesting


      = Cons =

      - The cutscenes would benefit from voice acting or a little sound effect with
      each line. The feel blend compared to the rest of the game''s presentation

      - The difficulty of some stage is crushing. I guess there were some of these
      in Megaman games as well. They''re meant to go back to after you''ve acquired
      some weapons and upgrades. I like a challenge so I don''t mind

      - No Steam Achievements :(


      =+- Conclusion -+=

      This game would be a perfect successor to Megaman X. The different powerups
      and tough ennemies promote a smart playstyle.


      NOTE: I''d start with "Mystic Mage" to get the boots if I were you. They help
      alot!'
