This game builds off of what I already love about the TD genre and throws in some new aspects, like a card system that adds modifiers to your towers/abilities. \n\nI think it has a good mix of strategy vs struggle. I felt challenged enough to try different strategies, but not so challenged that it was frustrating. It also seems like the enemies and maps are trying to prevent a meta build by requiring you to switch towers/commanders. I like that, as the planning is part of the fun.\n\nI think this one could be a real gem as it keeps developing. Don't get me wrong, as is, I think it's worth the buy.","timestamp_created":1608855685,"timestamp_updated":1608855685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+LDRy/YCcon1vAI="}
