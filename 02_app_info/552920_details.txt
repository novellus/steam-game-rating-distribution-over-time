Please do not buy Sailaway if you expect otherwise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sail around the world<\/h2>In Sailaway, the oceans of the planet are simulated with unparalleled accuracy at actual scale.

These are laid out tracks that can be sailed at your convenience. The sailor with the fastest time holds the record. You can compare this with the Jules Verne Trophy or the Transatlantic record.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Learn to sail<\/h2>The good thing about a simulation is that nothing can go wrong and there are tutorials to get you started with the basics if you need. Feel free to practice until you get the feel for the wind and the position of your sails to make the boat move forward. The simulation can assist by pressing the &quot;helping hand&quot; button. and it can perform certain tasks for you, so you can focus on one aspect at a time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Optimize sail trim<\/h2>The boats in Sailaway are equipped with a full range of trim lines for each sail. Outhauls, cunninghamholes, barberhaulers, travellers, backstays, everything to give full control over the shape of the sails. This shape will not only change visibly when a trim line is adjusted, but this will also affect airflow and ultimately boat speed just like it would in the real world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Navigate coastal waters<\/h2>Over 500,000 buoys, lights and other seamarks will help you navigate along your favorit coastline.<br>You can plan your trip, set waypoints and avoid shallow areas and rocks. For some areas the community members have made high detailed height maps and even added accurate models of real world buildings, structures and lighthouses. The rest of the world will display buildings from Open Streetmap.","about_the_game":"Have you ever dreamed of sailing along your favorit coastline or among the tropical islands of the South Pacific?<br>Maybe you prefer the challenge of sailing across the Southern Oceans enduring the fiercest storms they have to offer?<br>Or you just wish to learn to sail but have no access to a boat to do so?<br><br>With Sailaway you can do all of these things.
