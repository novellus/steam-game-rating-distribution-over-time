    review: "I bought this on sale for $2.79 and would say I got a great deal. 1.4\
      \ hours for a single playthrough. I thoroughly enjoyed it and may play it again.\n\
      \nIt's a basic city builder and labor assignment game. It does a job well of\
      \ pulling in mechanics I like such as upgrading, research, and labor division.\
      \ The labor assignment system remind of lotr 2 a little bit. It's essentially\
      \ turn based but with auto turns.\n\nI noticed a couple inconsistencies in UI\
      \ text size at the very end. The camera controls kind of bother me but aren't\
      \ really important. \n\nI hope to see more games like this."
