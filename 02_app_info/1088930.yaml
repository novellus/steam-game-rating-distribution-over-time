      \nWraysbury is one of the most historic carp fishing venues of all time and\

      \ different features to explore, with around 500 carp (common, mirror and ghost)\
      \ topped by Mary at 56lbs. There are also pike, tench, bream and roach to target\
      \ with 25 different trophy fish.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGillhams is a fishing\
      \ paradise located in Krabi, Thailand. This holiday resort is on the bucket\
      \ list of many anglers due to the exotic species from South America and Asia\
      \ that swim in its rich waters.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite only 12 acres in\
      \ size, there are 5 brand new species of fish - arapaima, siamese carp, redtail\
      \ catfish, mekong and black pacu with each reaching staggering weights including\
      \ Arapaima to over an incredible 560lbs!"
