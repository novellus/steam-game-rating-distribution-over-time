Looking back, I have a treasure trove full of fond memories as I unraveled the mysteries between Mark and Myra. And now, 5 years later, I went back to revisit the story that made me love the visual novel genre as a whole. Reading through the stories in the Reprise Edition, I could notice the lack of remastered art for Lukas, Rin, and Lillian, because I did not count the beautiful CGs as part of those. \n\nIt's very awkward to look at remastered Myra talking to Rin, Lukas or Lillian when their art is still outdated. If there is a reason why the devs decided to continue on like that then I'll just try to understand it.\n\nAs for the extra writing, I think it still has the same magic that made me fall in love 5 years ago, and even today. The only downside however, is that the realization that those 3 stories are the only ones we will ever get, and Mark and Myra's story has now concluded. I wish for more, dear writers. It's just so good.\n\nMaybe I'll try supporting the studio's other works this time. I can't stay rooted to this VN forever. \n\nBut still. Thank you so much, Scarlet String Studios, for making such an incredibly written visual novel. I will always treasure this forever.","timestamp_created":1608867798,"timestamp_updated":1608867798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411792755126953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv8v/y/YCeIT5vAI="}
