The underlying humor, charming visual design, unique mobility aspects and even the fantastic soundtrack composed by Piotr Surmacz all combine to create one of the more interesting and fun experiences you can have in VR.  It’s been a slow year for quality VR titles, but Yupitergrad clearly achieves top honors in this memorable action-platformer that you don’t want to miss.”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/gamechronicles.com\/video-games\/yupitergrad-review-pc-vr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Chronicles<\/a><br><br>“Thanks to how well these grappling cup hooks work together with the thrusters and a great level design we are facing a really fun, frantic platforming game that will not give us a single moment of respite. It's great to move freely and fluidly between giant fans, past platforms that would crush you in the face of a bad move, then end up propelling yourself underwater to avoid being blown away by spinning spikes.”<br>8\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.desconsolados.com\/analisis\/yupitergrad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Desconsolados<\/a><br><br>“In a sea of “Spiderman sims,” Yupitergrad is a must-have title for your VR library.
