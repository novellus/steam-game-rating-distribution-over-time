    review: "I'd love it if we could financially support all the indie devs in the\
      \ world, but sadly we cannot. [b][i]Greenspawn Restaurant[/i] has heart, but\
      \ unfortunately not all small projects are worth money or time.[/b] Finishing\
      \ any video game project is a major accomplishment, so my hat's off to the dev\
      \ - a sincere congratulations. The artwork and ambient sounds are nice, but\
      \ the gameplay is flat and the whole thing has too many rough edges. \n\n[i]Essentially,\
      \ vegan customers come up and place an order consisting of various veggies.[/i]\
      \ You toggle between two screens; one where you serve the customer, and another\
      \ that is a shooting gallery of sorts where you 'kill' more veggies to keep\
      \ your stock full. Ultimately this is a score chaser.\n\n[i]Here is just a few\
      \ notes for the developer:[/i]\n[list]\n[*]In the shooting gallery, I think\
      \ it would be much better to simply hold the mouse button down instead of spam\
      \ clicking to kill the veggies. It grows tiresome and tedious.\n[*]The yellow\
      \ lemon text is near impossible for me to read.\n[*]Why use two buttons ('a'\
      \ and 'd') to swap screens? Wouldn't it be more efficient to just use one button,\
      \ because there are only two screens? Perhaps 'tab' or middle mouse button therefore\
      \ eliminating any need for the keyboard.\n[*]If you lose before one day is finished,\
      \ the score is absent when it should probably read '0'/zero.\n[*]Another way\
      \ to play may be to simply bind everything to the keyboard. This would probably\
      \ be much better and allow faster and less tedious gameplay. Food for thought.[/list]\n\
      \n[b]Best of luck with any future projects.[/b] I'd surely be interested in\
      \ what you create next."
