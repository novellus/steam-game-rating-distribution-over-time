It uses the Super Power companion to emulate psychic abilities of operatives who run missions in secrecy from society. It feels a lot like Metal Gear Solid.\nThe Setting is very polished and up to date, even on SW Deluxe edition it uses lots of changes present on SWADE, like the Thievery skill, or athletics instead of throwing. I wanted a setting to run a SWADE game, so it came out perfect and feels like a SWADE product.\n\nAs for the conversion, the theme is beautiful and all the radial menu icons are re-done and look beautiful. I had this idea of grouping the setting loadouts in parcels to give it to my players easily, and to my surprise they were already done in the module. Just perfect.","timestamp_created":1546585294,"timestamp_updated":1546585294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy9jqi+gCepq5twE="}
