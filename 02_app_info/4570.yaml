    review: for some reason i don't get it i try to find ways to improve my gaming
      by using mods but game like dawn of war doesn't seems to allow mods like soul
      storm ultimate apocalypse or dark crusade and don't get me wrong dawn of war
      1 had me interested in it's executions which really hit the spot in me but it
      seems i cant have mods for dawn of war and i was wonder is there a way to have
      mods for everyone's favorite game like dawn of war supreme commander and other
      hard hit games, like this so om asking to developers to somehow come back and
      retry on their series please and thank if you read this long message
