The time played showing is not the actual playing time as I left the game running while not playing.  During the first boss you get a loading error for audio that keeps popping up every few seconds and continues to do so after the battle.  After beating the boss it takes you to a cutscene that loads to a new town with two new characters, loading error still popping up and you are unable to leave the town to advance the game due to a glitch.  I would hold off buying the game till the glitches are fixed.  Too early in the game to encounter so many glitches.","timestamp_created":1595862168,"timestamp_updated":1595862168,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1596042998,"developer_response":"Thank you for letting us know about this!
