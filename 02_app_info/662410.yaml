    developer_response: 'EDIT 2:


      Thank you so much for updating your review! Hope to get some of these changes
      in at some point! :)


      EDIT:


      Hello, again! I have pushed an immediate patch to be live for both Windows and
      macOS. This change includes a completely new level 80, which mechanically fits
      way better than the Sokoban level before. I would love for you to attempt a
      playthrough of the level and let me know what you think of this change!


      - Jonathan Holmes (crait)


      ORIGINAL RESPONSE:


      Wow, you are absolutely correct. I have never played Pocoman, but looking at
      a playthrough, I see that level 80 does, in fact, appear to be completely plagiarized.
      I pride myself in the levels that I have created for Circuit Dude, so it is
      needless to say an embarrassment that this was left in to the final game. I
      cannot remember the exact circumstances of how this level came about, but I
      do know that when I found a handful of other games to inspire the design of
      the levels in Circuit Dude, I was sure to include at least one twist that could
      only exist in Circuit Dude, such as using a new mechanic, that would completely
      change the solution, feel, and look of the level. Among the games that I found
      inspiration from was a Sokoban clone that I played on my phone.


      I can only imagine that one of two things must have happened: 1) I recreated
      a level from the Sokoban clone in order to play through it with the intent of
      playing with the design/solution until it was a completely different level and
      I marked it in my notes incorrectly as being a final design. (I did launch the
      game with a level or two in incomplete states and had to release a bug fix.
      I think this was because I re-arranged the level order so many times and had
      several design passes through certain selections of levels based off of the
      notes I had made.) With the incorrect notes, it made its way into the game,
      getting mixed in with the other, genuinely unique and self-made levels. Or,
      2) I actually did go through the entire process of creating a new puzzle using
      the Pocoman/Sokoban level as a base and saved it into an older stash of level
      data files that I had and did not include it in the most updated set of levels.
      This means that the new level may have been lost as I purged the older placeholder
      levels in favor of the (what I thought were) most up-to-date levels.


      Regardless of what happened, I''d like to reiterate that I completely agree
      that plagiarism is wrong and I must try my best to rectify this problem as it
      was definitely not my intention to steal anyone else''s creative works.


      This weekend, I''m absolutely making it my purpose to do the following:

      1) Go through and find any notes I''ve had with level 80 to determine what actually
      happened in the design process to see where my personal errors were.

      2) Go through every level that I have to review all of them for any levels that
      may also have this problem.

      3) I will either replace this version of the level with the level I find OR
      I will completely create a brand new level that will be 100% unique to Circuit
      Dude and can only exist in Circuit Dude, with the mechanics that I have available.
      (This includes any other level that I feel is not genuinely Circuit Dude.)

      4) I''m going to push this update out as soon as possible.


      I''d like to thank you for bringing this to my attention and I''d hate to think
      that I let you down, or anyone who purchased my game. I''m a solo developer
      and this is really the first project I''ve ever sold, so I''m trying my best
      to make sure that it''s as genuine as I can make it.


      As for your other complaints, I''d like to address:


      - 1 musical track: Part of the 2.0 update, I was able to pay my friend to produce
      another track for the game... The tracks alternate every other level, and, of
      course, the ''chill'' track takes over when you finish placing the last chip.
      I know that music could be repetitive, but I unfortunately do not have enough
      funds to have more tracks produced. I tried to alleviate any repetitiveness
      by allowing the user to mute the music (while SFX still played) so they can
      play their own background music on YouTube or their own media player. If I come
      out with a 3.0, I''ll try to introduce another track into the mix.


      - Waiting and speed: In retrospect, I do wish I could have balanced gameplay
      speed and animations a little better. With the exception of restarting a level
      (I want to make sure players can cancel a level reset so they don''t accidentally
      restart) I think there are probably ways of speeding up certain animations or
      cutting down certain jingles to speed up the gameplay. Thanks for this comment
      and I''ll take it into consideration for a 3.0 if I''m able to push that out.


      Again, I appreciate your comment and I''ll make sure to follow up whenever the
      patch is out for the updated level(s).

    review: 'This review has been edited to respond to the update that addresses my
      biggest complaint- the original review text will be left at the bottom.


      First off: The fact that the developer read the review, saw that a puzzle from
      elsewhere had made it into the game, fact-checked this, responded, and made
      an update within 48 hours is exactly the kind of thing I want to support.


      I''d be borderline on recommending Circuit Dude or not, as there are things
      I really like about the game and some things that I find annoying. The pathing
      puzzles are consistently very nicely put together, and blocks tend to be used
      sparingly as part of those pathfinding puzzles in a way I haven''t really seen
      done in other games. The way blocks interact with turning doors and teleports
      is unintuitive to me, but that''s not a big deal. There''s no undo button which
      might be a dealbreaker for some, but I''ve played far too much Chip''s Challenge
      for that to really bother me. The biggest drawback, however, is that many animation
      times are far longer than they need to be which makes executing a known solution,
      or returning to a previously attempted state take longer than it needs to. Pushing
      a block has a short animation every single time, plugging in the last chip has
      a several second animation of the exit activating every single time, restarting
      a level takes several seconds of nothing (this is to prevent accidentally restarting,
      but I think having to hit the button twice in a row would do this just as well
      to confirm), while anything is on a conveyor belt you can''t move...


      But all that said, I have to go back to the quick fix and addition of a very
      well put together new level and 100% recommend this game. We need more developers
      with integrity!




      Level 80 takes the first level of Pocoman without any alteration. I don''t support
      plagarizing puzzles.


      Circuit Dude also has only one music track for the entire game, and everything
      is needlessly slow. Pushing blocks has a second long animation for a push, restarting
      a level takes several seconds of waiting, and on placing the last item in a
      level there''s a several second jingle and animation before you can move again.


      The pathing puzzles are generally quite nice, so even with the above complaints
      I''d be torn on a recommendation or not. But again: I don''t support plagarism.'
