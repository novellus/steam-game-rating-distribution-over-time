    review: The game's launcher properly detects wide monitor setups like 3840 x 1080
      or 5760 x 1080, but once you get in game it automatically shoves that to the
      lowest possible resolution and you can only pick 16:9 aspect ratios. It seems
      like the in game engine doesn't support widescreen options like 21:9, 32:9,
      etc.
