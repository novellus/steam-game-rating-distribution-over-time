The jousting and dueling mini-games are also pretty unfun, demanding repeated perfection while clearly setting up the player to fail from imprecision.  The ramps don't feel clearly defined, and there's so much clutter to the point where vision of the table is impaired, notably right behind the left flipper.\n\nExcalibur is challenging, but not in a good way.  I wouldn't recommend buying this one.","timestamp_created":1499625363,"timestamp_updated":1499625408,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4PiolN0CfZq6fw=="}
