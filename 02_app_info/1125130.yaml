    about_the_game: You and your team get together to storm the Area 51 military base
      and uncover the mysteries it holds. Find and release the captive aliens that
      are held at the base. You will unlock new and more effective classes and abilities
      as you level up and progress through the game. Fight against the military as
      they continue to hold off the hordes of raiders.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1125130/extras/naruto_runners.png?t=1565672883"
      /><br>Runners are faster than all other classes. You can punch, or dash to attack
      the enemies. When killing an enemy during a dash attack, it will reset your
      dash cooldown which can be rewarding for calculated players.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1125130/extras/rock_throwers.png?t=1565672883"
      /><br>Rock throwers can hit their target from long range. This advantage could
      help you rescue more aliens without having to get too close to enemies. You
      can throw small rocks and large boulders that will deal a lot of damage upon
      impact.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1125130/extras/kyles.png?t=1565672883"

      drinking your energy drink you get a +10 damage buff and go berserk.<br><br>More
      classes are available and there are more to come!<h2 class="bb_tag">SANDBOX</h2>Create
      your own scenarios and spawn as many units as you want! Fight in your own custom

    review: Even though it is a meme game, at least make it a fun and detailed game.
      I do not care if it is a meme game, i expect quality. Game is short and repetitive.
      There seems to be only one map. There are three classes that i could care less
      about. The meme wasn't even that funny to begin with. I just wanted it to see
      if it was a good game. They could of made it a free to play game just for a
      joke but we are expected to pay for this? No. No point in refunding it because
      of how dirt cheap it is. Poor effort, poor gameplay, poor environment, and poor
      pricing. I give it a 2/10.
