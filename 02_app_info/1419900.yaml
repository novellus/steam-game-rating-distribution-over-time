    review: '!! IF DLC DOES NOT WORK, CONTACT TABLETOPIA TO SOLVE !!

      (there is no issue with the board game itself after they add it manually)


      PROBLEM: I bought The Isle of Cats DLC, but Tabletopia doesn''t let me open
      a table, any setup, not even solo... a pop-up still says I need Premium and
      instead of opening a lobby, goes back to Home. Other users already reported
      this problem in their reviews.


      I already bought a bunch of Tabletopia DLC and they work perfectly, also playing
      in a browser: you just have to start Tabletopia on Steam after the purchase,
      so your account is updated and unlocked games appear in your Tabletopia library
      online.


      UPDATE: Apparently it''s an issue in their billing system...

      SOLUTION: "Please, forward your Tabletopia account ID and screenshot demonstrating
      your payment in Steam to support@tabletopia.com. We''ll add it manually to your
      account."


      Problem solved "manually" by Tabletopia but I hope they find a better fix...'
