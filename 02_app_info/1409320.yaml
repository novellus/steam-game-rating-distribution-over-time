    about_the_game: "According to the Russian Satellite News Agency, a professor at\
      \ the University of New Jersey in the United States gave the tragic situation\
      \ after the US-Russia nuclear war. If the United States and Russia use nuclear\
      \ weapons to attack each other without restriction, most creatures on the surface\
      \ of the earth will die. Moreover, such deaths are not instantaneous, but last\
      \ for many years. After the nuclear war, the earth will experience a 10-year\
      \ nuclear winter. Because the nuclear war will cause 1.47 million tons of ash\
      \ layer to diverge upwards, enter the stratosphere of the atmosphere, and then\
      \ within a month, it will cover the entire sky above the earth, making it impossible\
      \ for sunlight to reach the surface of the earth. The average temperature is\
      \ less than 9 degrees, thus entering winter mode. Such a pattern will last for\
      \ 7 years, and then the dust will gradually begin to dissipate, and the entire\
      \ dissipating time will take as long as Su years, a total of 10 years. If you\
      \ leave the sun for such a long time, the earth will be devastated. Therefore,\
      \ no one can bear the price of unlimited use of nuclear weapons.<br><img src=\"\

      \ The advection characteristics of the stratosphere determine that these dust\
