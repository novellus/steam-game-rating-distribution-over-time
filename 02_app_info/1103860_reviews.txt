New world to explore, new enemies do deal with. Items to hunt and a new way to access them\n\nHowever I do miss some things of the first. Like the map in the first game where you could visually see where you are where you are going and how you did at each level. Also I have not seen a way to see whether I have misses something in the level I just passed.\n\nAll said, however, this game nicely follows the path of being a wizard in VR. Hopefully new release of this title series will come out again. \n\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1609621161,"timestamp_updated":1609621161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wri54vYCe4ntvwI="}
