      Story</h2><br>This is the story of Charles. <br><br>He was once an ordinary
      man, with a simple life and simpler goals. Now, the endless run is the only
      life he knows. He is a hollow man, and his only goal is to achieve perfection,
      one step at a time. Society demands it, and what kind of man would he if he
      did not serve the common good?<br><br>Failure is <i>not an option</i>. Imperfection
      is <i>unacceptable</i>. Anything less than perfect is <i>flawed</i>. Welcome
      to the future.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br>This is an embarrassingly
      simple endless runner with randomized platforms and obstacles. Left mouse button
      or spacebar makes Charles jump and double jump. Holding them down makes him
      jump higher. You help him avoid stepping on rocks (because they hurt, I guess?)
      His running speed increases over time. Because there's no cap to the speed,
      it will inevitably be impossible to keep going, just as it will inevitably be
      impossible to keep chasing perfection.
