The art is very cute, I also liked the voicing and music.\nThe plot in the long run was weird, and though plenty about the game was enjoyable none of the endings really satisfied. So much of the game feels really neat and refined but for some reason, after playing through it completely I feel like the game was a little shallow.\nSince I did purchase this on sale it was very much worth the price, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to play something light and silly.","timestamp_created":1609057216,"timestamp_updated":1609057216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4JTS0fYCe73WvQI="}
