    review: "This game is a UUP (Unity-Used-Properly)\n\nHow was this game released\
      \ almost three years ago and has never gotten positive attention? \nThe design\
      \ reminds me of the Edmund McMillen game \"The End Is Nigh\" that released last\
      \ year (2017), although SLIDE\xB4s controls take way longer to get into. \n\
      I just bought \"SLIDE: platformer\" and played for about 1 1/2 hours, only getting\
      \ to Level 7 and without being frustrated! No game does that (now I stopped\
      \ playing though because my left thumb hurts like hell and I might consider\
      \ seeing the doctor). When I get back I will certainly find a way to continue.\
      \ \n5$ is a great price for this, cannot wait till I reach the exiting looking\
      \ areas shown in the trailer video.\nRecommended!\n\nEDIT: Played almost 3 hours\
      \ (got to Level 9) at this point and the controls still don\xB4t feel comfortable.\
      \ Especially the jumping/sliding up and down feel like they happen completely\
      \ random, don\xB4t even wanna know how a person with bigger fingers feels about\
      \ this."
