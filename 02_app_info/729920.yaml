    review: "Third in the series. This time, you head to Phoenix Hill, CA, where the\
      \ local mine dug a little too deep\u2026 As in deep enough to cause the mountain\
      \ to become a volcano. Now the city is covered in ash. Can you solve this mystery?\n\
      \nThe minigames are challenging, the HO scenes fun, and the plot engaging."
