    reviews: "\u201CI have had the chance to listen a couple times to dPoten's soundtrack\
      \ for the game Session Seven. The music adheres to a thrilling atmosphere, which\
      \ works great for the game. Although the music sometimes is a bit too present\
      \ at times in the game, it definitely puts the player in this puzzling environment.\
      \ The music doesn't get boring, but instead wants to be heard multiple times,\
      \ which is important for game music. As a personal favorite I would pick &quot;I\
      \ Was Terrified&quot;, but every track is well composed and worth a listen.\u201D\
