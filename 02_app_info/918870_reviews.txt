The gameplay is too linear and simple, completely based on hand-eye coordination. The enemies are predictable with varying speed of walking that only needs the player to use their eyes and intuition to progress however as i mentioned earlier the bugs will eventually make the gameplay utterly frustrating. \n\n1. Two objects next to each other have 'dead zone', so if you need to make a jump from platform to platform as you stand on multiple boxes, you will not be able to make the jump and simply fall and die. This is a very frustrating programming issue and you will encounter this countless times as you progress.\n\n2. Your reactions are often faster than the programming of the game allows for. Therefore you will not be able to make jumps and simply fall off the map and die. This once again is a repeated issue throughout the game.. Simply infuriating!\n\n3. Once you climb a ladder and an enemy is approaching you will not be able to jump standing directly on 'top' of it and may get killed. What you need to do is move a little in the opposite direction from the enemy. However if there is a cactus behind them, you will not be able to clear the jump and will take damage ( - 1 life) or die and have to restart a level.\n\n4. The 'life' drops in crates are rare in each level and may be down to as little as one per level so breaking all boxes and barrels once you got all the achievements associated with those simply takes unnecessary time away and does not produce the drops that you require.\n\n5. Controls are set and even when you change them in 'input' section of the menu, they don't change. I tried re-loading and re-installing the game several times and changing both primary and secondary control inputs, but it didn't make any difference so thats a big minus in my book...\n\n6. The levels are generic and don't introduce any new challanges to the player, so the game becomes 'interesting' only to those who like to get all the achievements. As a gameplay goes it quickly becomes boring and frustrating because of it's countless and glaring programming shortcomings..\n\nUnity engine is very powerful and has the ability to deliver superb results, envolving and adaptable gameplay and customizable controls. However this developer chose an easy route and brought out a very simple and mediocre title.\n\nI have played a much more interesting and progressive title back in 1989 - 'Prince of Persia'. using an old DOS operating system, so almost 20 years later using Unity engine, I as a gamer expect much more from the developer..\n\nOne redeeming feature of this title - if one can even call it that, is the price and if you are after another 'perfect game' count on your account, it's a cheap investement and will deliver exactly that, however if you are after something envolving and progressive - look elsewhere..\n\nWARNING: After getting all the achievements the game will not be counted in your 'perfect game' counter!","timestamp_created":1542238178,"timestamp_updated":1542246556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601180374622344971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwltzDiucCcOvjrgE="}
