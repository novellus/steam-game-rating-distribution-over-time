    review: 'While I enjoy HoGs, even ones that feel really old, I was determined
      to play to the finish until I reached the halfway point. I don''t know if there''s
      a bug in this chapter, but I missed one object in a scene I couldn''t seem to
      find and another never showed up and then I couldn''t go back to get the object
      I needed. After that, I''ve had it freeze several times in the middle of game
      play and I''ve had it freeze upon trying to load the game. I hate to abandon
      games, but this isn''t the first one I''ve encountered with such issues.


      I would not recommend this game at full price.'
