It doesn't feel like a lot of the best custom songs where you learn the patterns and the beat and eventually get the win.  It just feels like half the notes are off beat, and the other half are patterns completely pointlessly.  \n\nHard Pass.\n\nPlayed on Expert+","timestamp_created":1609981513,"timestamp_updated":1609981513,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40omY7fYCeO+TwQI="}
