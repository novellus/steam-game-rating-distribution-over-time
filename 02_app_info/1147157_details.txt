They were outdated in most regards, with their varying designs leading to inconsistent services and expensive maintenance. <br><br>It was decided to order a new fleet of trains that, across 2 variants, would replace every train on the sub-surface network. This new train was called the S Stock and an order of 191 was placed. The two variants would be the S7 and S8, the former being for the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and District Lines, featuring 7-cars and fully longitudinal seating, and the latter for the Metropolitan Line, which would be 8-cars in length and have a revised interior with some transverse seating.<br><br>While seating capacity saw a downgrade, the new S Stock was able to take a much higher number of standing passengers, aided in particular by a revolutionary open-plan design that saw the end of narrow gangways between coaches. This, plus greater performance and future ability for automatic operation meant the S Stock was set to transform sub-surface travel.<br><br>The S8 variant entered service on the “Met” in July 2010, with all 58 for the line in service by the end of 2012 and, as the line shares tracks with Chiltern’s Aylesbury line, you can experience modern commuter operations with Just Trains’ authentic London Underground S8!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2><br>A total of 12 Standard and 5 Free Roam scenarios are included for the London – Aylesbury route<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>JT S8 – Saturday Night in London<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – 426 07:18 Harrow-Amersham<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Builders Bag Bother (Part 1)<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Builders Bag Bother (Part 2)<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Early Start<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Empty to Rickmansworth<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – 437 07:14 Amersham-Aldgate<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Snow Sunday<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Rickmansworth Start<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Lazy Sunday Afternoon<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – At the end of the day<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Total Chaos<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Rickmansworth Free Roam<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Amersham Free Roam<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Harrow On The Hill Free Roam<br><\/li><li>JT S8 – Neasden Free Roam<br><\/li><li>Amersham Free Roam<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1107813\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >London Marylebone - Aylesbury Route Add-On<\/a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.<\/strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
