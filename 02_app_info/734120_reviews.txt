I don't regret getting this on sale. It's really short, but the story is unique and I liked playing as a toddler. It was creepy! Subtitles were good as well for any deaf/hard of hearing folks. \n\nIt's not the most polished or lengthy game out there, but I enjoyed it for what it is. I hope the developer will release more stuff like this in the future!","timestamp_created":1606341495,"timestamp_updated":1606341543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xdjagPYCcr6PsQI="}
