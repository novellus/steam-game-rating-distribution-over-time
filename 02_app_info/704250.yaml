    review: The route isn't long enough for the cost-27 miles between Raton and Trinidad,
      the main part of the route. There's probably another 20 past either town, to
      the next sidings. The rolling stock is worth it though, You get 3 of the most
      detailed engines in the game, a full Amtrak train, and a TON of freight cars
      including boxcars in 3 livers(Brown, Blue, and Yellow w/ black door), coal cars,
      gondolas, centerbeams and bulkheads, and a 5-car spine set with different loads
      for each car. Worth the cost overall, and espcecily on a sale, as I got it for.
      I would recommend this route, it's a good deal overall.
