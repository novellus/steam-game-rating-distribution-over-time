      /><br>Test your training in the arena with a more active and reactive dummy,
      that follows your every move. Move around it in full 360 to dodge incoming attacks
      and gain strategic positions for unleashing blows.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1340300/extras/yourdojo.png?t=1609840574"

      /><br>Train to become the greatest Kung Fu Master the world has ever seen. You
      will begin as a tourist to Martial Arts, with no experience and slow reflexes.
      You will progressively move onto harder tiers of training, faster and more complex,
      until you no longer need to think but simply react.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1340300/extras/CKF_03.gif?t=1609840574"

      /><br>In Crazy Kung Fu you will fight against a wooden training dummy, using
      your hands as well as your body to punch, block and dodge the various spinning
      arms. Throughout your journey you will learn how to be a master at all of these,
      building muscle memory at first, to then rely on instinct and quick thinking.<br><br><img

      /><br>All your moves are tracked, you will have statistics on speed, accuracy,
      strength, all of which will help you assess your progress, target your weaknesses
      and push towards becoming a Kung Fu Master.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1340300/extras/CKF_07.gif?t=1609840574"
      /><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1340300/extras/complete.png?t=1609840574"
      /><br>There are a variety of extra modes to challenge yourself futher, from
      catching and eating shrimp while you fight, to dodging arrows from both sides.
      And for those who want to take their training a step further they can use the
      Infinite mode and training for as long as they can hold.
