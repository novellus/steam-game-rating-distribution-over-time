    short_description: In a world where psychological states can be quantified, every
      choice has consequences, victims can become criminals, and the very nature of
      truth can warp and shift. Can detectives Nadeshiko Kugatachi and Takuma Tsurugi
      remain on the path of justice as they face the ugly truths of humanity?

    review: "As a fan of the anime, I've always wondered what is to be an Inspector\
      \ under the Sibyl System. \nWell, this game gives you the opportunity to pull\
      \ the trigger of the Dominator and judge right from wrong by your moral compass.\n\
      \ \nThe Game immerses you in the Psycho-Pass universe and you get to make hard\
      \ decisions side by side with some of your favorite characters. The voice acting\
      \ is really good as well as the music, all of the anime characters have their\
      \ traits and nothing feels off or like they won't say or do, and the UI is pleasant\
      \ and true to the anime. \nThe art is 10/10, the moment you see it you know\
      \ its from Psycho-Pass.  \n\nOverall, the characters -Nadeshiko Kugatachi and\
      \ Takuma Tsurugi are likable and have different personalities.\nIn fact all\
      \ of the characters are very well written and at some point or another, I found\
      \ myself sympathizing with Alpha and even some of the victims (or latent criminals\
      \ I guess} \nAs far as I am in the game, the choices have their impact in the\
      \ story and it can be anxious when choosing the faith of a characters as the\
      \ player can feel the burden of the choice they are making. \n\nIf you are not\
      \ a fan of the anime, the story is pretty solid and interesting, however there\
      \ are some mentions of cases that happened in the anime that you may not understand\
      \ or you will have to look it up. \n\nGood luck on your first day, Inspectors.\
      \ \n"
