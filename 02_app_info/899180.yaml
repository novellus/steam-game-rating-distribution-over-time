    review: 'Changed my mind to "not recommend", but I think it requires detailed
      explanation.

      The game is not completely bad - but there are so many bad elements that adds
      up and start poisoning the fun.


      What I liked and what feels good:

      + Clean visuals with almost no visual noise.

      + Music and sound, voice acting

      + Guns are big which is good for VR - easier to aim.

      + No stupid reloading, shooting pistols and grenade launcher feels rewarding.

      + Entering and leaving level happens without loading


      But there are issues I wish to explain in details:

      - When on a base between missions, the interface is blocked until the narration
      ends. And it happens after each mission - you can''t choose next mission or
      access upgrades menu before voice finishes speaking. Very dumb, very annoying.

      - Building turrets in a mission consumes the main resource. And it is never
      explained to player. You may finish the mission but with almost 0 money left.
      That is especially demotivating when the mission was hard to beat: you put a
      lot of effort and the payoff is in reverse proportion. The game forces you to
      replay easier missions where you can win without extra turrets at all.

      - Guns available to the player. The first two guns, pistols and grenade launcher,
      are good: requires some skill to shoot, fun to operate. But the other two...
      The effect and operation is not instantly obvious to the player. When there
      are 3 and more guns, switching to the needed gun becomes a challenge and I didn''t
      found an option to exclude unneeded guns from my arsenal. Ounce you unlocked
      it - it will be with you on every mission.

      - Upgrades for the guns may seem ok, but you didn''t feel any noticeable difference.

      - Enemies are boring: looks the same and are bullet sponges. Except the very
      basic one they require multiple direct hits to kill. It generally feels better
      when there are many low-HP enemies that one with high HP, but the game does
      not do that.

      - TD games usually prioretizes towers over manually controlled weapons (abilities).
      Towers do main damage while manual abilities are situational and in general
      do very little damage. But that is not regular top-down TD, it''s a VR game
      where you shoots in 1st person and it is the main player''s activity within
      the game. And your direct shooting is made less important that building towers.
      That feels seriously broken especially in higher levels: the game forces you
      to shoot in 1st person and focus all your attention on it, but it is not the
      way you win.

      - The difference between towers not obvious: looks like it is always better
      to use more expensive towers, no combinations of towers of different type (like
      freezing tower + splash damage tower) are involved.

      - The amount of guns and types of towers is very limited. The levels looks the
      same with no variations in visual style, the same with enemies. There is not
      enough content.


      Conclusion!

      The issues with amount of content may be hard to fix for a small dev. team,
      but it is totally unreasonable why other aspects of the game are below the threshold.
      Overall the game has good formula: TD + shooting gallery + upgrades. That makes
      it somehow interesting to play in general, but any sole aspect of the game is
      not up to the standards: TD is bad, shooting gallery is bad, system of upgrades
      does not has enough options and in turn also bad.

      The game starts to feel repetitive after ~1 hour of play.'
