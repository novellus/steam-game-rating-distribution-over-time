    about_the_game: "When Kai hears that his next door neighbor, Chris, will be staying\
      \ with him while her parents are overseas, he thinks nothing of it. They're\
      \ best friends, after all, and have been since childhood. To him, she's just\
      \ &quot;one of the guys&quot;, and a sleepover is nothing new.<br><br>But what\
      \ Kai doesn\u2019t realize is that, tomboy or not, Chris is now an adult woman.\
      \ Furthermore, she has a strong sex drive, and she's planning to use their cohabitation\
      \ as an excuse to show him sides of her that Kai never knew existed.<br><br>Just\
      \ as Chris's advances begin to take effect, however, an obstacle appears: Sophie,\
      \ Kai's most recent crush. She's a beautiful girl who radiates kindness, and\
      \ naturally attracts people of both sexes towards her. Her only downfall appears\
      \ to be that, for every nice word spoken about her, an equal number of heinous\
      \ rumors drag her name through the mud...<br><br>Will the advances of Sophie,\
      \ the girl whom Kai has been pining over for months, manage to sway his heart?\
      \ Or will Chris finally convince him that the perfect woman was by his side\
      \ all along?<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 5 different endings\
