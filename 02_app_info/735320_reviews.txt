The music was not all that great and the animation and models were a little rough around the edges. The only reason that I would recommend this is because it is made by a small studio that I believe could produce some higher quality work in the future if they have the funds. Also, at this point, VR music videos are fairly unique, so this was a novel experience.\n\nScore:\n6/10","timestamp_created":1516248231,"timestamp_updated":1516248231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xf3bg+ECf5O0lgE="}
