    review: "The most boring game I have ever seen. It is neither fun nor realistic.\
      \ It is nothing except a load of shit. \nFirst of all, the protagonist's gender\
      \ cannot be chosen. It is compulsory female. Many people studying psychology\
      \ are female but not necessarily. Secondly, the impression of the tutor is too\
      \ horrific. It not true for every tutor to be horrific. At the same time, the\
      \ tutor will not LITERALLY let you to collect 10 references as it is a EXTREMELY\
      \ SMALL NUMBER of reference. FIVE sample is also TOO SMALL. The ETHICS are violated\
      \ as the participants have WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS. Also, they need VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION.\
      \ NOT TO PERSUADE PARTICIPANTS TO JOIN IN! The sampling procedure is a CONVENIENCE\
      \ SAMPLING. THE P - VALUE IS NOT TO BE CREATED BY THESE MULTI-ANALYSIS TOOLS!\
      \ THE AMBIANCE OF THE GAME IS HORRIFIC AND EVOKES A SENSE OF DISGUST! YOU CAN\
      \ PRECISELY MAKE A HORRIFIC GAME INSTEAD OF A STIMULATION GAME.\nOverall, I\
      \ strongly not recommend this game."
