    review: "This is an enjoyable HOG game, if you like those types of games. The\
      \ minigames aren't too terribly difficult (compared to others that I've seen\
      \ in some games). I didn't need any hints and didn't use any skips. It just\
      \ took some time to figure things out. \n\nThis game has a guide, including\
      \ a section that shows where the collectibles are.\nIt has a map you can click\
      \ on to travel and that shows where you've got activities you can do.\nIt has\
      \ multiple difficulty settings\nI also has 2 types of collectibles (Glass globes\
      \ and morphing objects)\nYou can also get other types of special items from\
      \ completing the game.\nThere's an extra chapter, which was interesting.\n\n\
      The only negative I could find? The Mouse King's voice actor. It's like he just\
      \ couldn't get interested enough to wake up and do his lines. Everything else\
      \ was pretty and well done. I enjoyed the story, too. It's not what people are\
      \ used to hearing when they hear about the Nutcracker. The story is significantly\
      \ different.\n\nSo, yeah, if you like Hidden Object Games (HOG's) or point/click\
      \ adventure games, this one is a good choice, especially if you want something\
      \ that has a Christmas theme."
