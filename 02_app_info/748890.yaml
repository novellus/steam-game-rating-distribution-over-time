    review: 'holy hell this book is so good. i really felt like a rebel leader, and
      i could barely stop reading. i suppose my only complaint would be that the romance
      (if you want romance) isn''t very fleshed out. i do enjoy a not heavy focus
      on romance but i think if it was slightly more fleshed out it would have added
      to the emotional connection since i could only garner some fondness towards
      my love interest while leaving my character''s deeper feelings up to imagination.
      same goes with most other characters actually, there are some interactions but
      the heavy focus is on being a rebel leader, which is of course good and necessary
      but again my character''s relationship with her peers is largely left up to
      my own mind. still, considering this [i]is[/i] a text based cyoa i suppose leaving
      things up to the imagination is sort of the main point.

      long story short i recommend this to anyone who loves control of their character,
      you get to make so many meaningful choices, and looking to be immersed into
      a world of careful rebel scheming - you truly get to choose your own path (&
      the worldbuilding is so obviously carefully put together and interesting! an
      added bonus imo)'
