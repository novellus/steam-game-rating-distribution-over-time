    review: 'I''m a fan of local co-op party games, and this one is a fun one!


      It has a lot of different modes for good variety, and cool stylized graphics.


      The top review says that the game is not good for local co-op because of the
      split screen, but I wanted to say that it actually works pretty well.  You can
      split the screen into 2, 3 or 4 windows.  As that review said, it might be interesting
      to allow an option for all the players to use a shared map (ala Duck Game and
      Ultimate Chicken Horse), but maybe it''s just too small to see if you do that.  But
      don''t be scared off, it still works fine as is.'
