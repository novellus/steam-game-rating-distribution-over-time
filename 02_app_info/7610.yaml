    review: The Steam version is unplayable on Windows 10 without modding, be prepared
      to spend a good bit in the Steam community forums to find instructions on fixing
      it. Once fixed, it seems pretty stable and hasn't crashed once. This game is
      about as easy to approach as your average strategy game and can quickly demand
      the same time commitment as well. It's fairly easy to spend an afternoon just
      playing this game without realizing it (I have a physical copy as well so my
      Steam playtime doesn't reflect my total playtime).
