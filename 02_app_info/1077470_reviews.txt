'Course, in several cases you can sidestep the question. Sometimes it's even an option to set boundaries for what you feel comfortable and capable answering!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]First play session[/h1]\nI did experience a crash bug -- hence why I stopped at 2 hours because I was [b]hooked.[/b] It was kinda helpful because I needed the prompt to stop. Since I was expecting it from the reviews I'd read, it wasn't jarring or upsetting. And yeah, to echo the others, I would absolutely agree that the game is still worth playing. I hope they're not every 10 minutes or anything, but if 2 hours is more the average, then I'd say it's a good exchange. Oh and my save file was fine afterwards too afaik.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Crash bugs might be common.\n    [*]Near the end of [spoiler]your introduction to Dr. Freeman,[/spoiler] there is a very out-of-place voice line.\n    [*]The collectibles can be a little hard to find until you know what they look like.\n    [*]Some of the UI is a little rough -- still works tho!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutrals[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The art quality feels a little inconsistent.\n    [*]I don't know how to do certain things, but idk if that was because I missed instructions or they weren't given.\n    [*]I didn't know what some of the psychology terms meant precisely, but a quick search generally helped. [spoiler]I'm thinking of the early bit where you explain some of the ethical issues.[/spoiler]\n    [*]There was a weird bit where [spoiler]I increased the trust level for someone that was then different between a conversation and the next day at the desk. However that could have changed overnight regardless.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Literally everything about the story is enthralling.\n    [*]I don't feel talked down to.\n    [*]A video game can talk about mental health with respect and nuance?!\n    [*]Syntherapy asks really interesting questions about balancing commitments, responsibility and integrity.\n    [*]The characters feel like they have real expectations, back and forth.\n    [*]'Helping' fictional characters feels like helping yourself.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] omg just play it. jfc check the TWs tho.","timestamp_created":1608684770,"timestamp_updated":1608684997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mKHGxvYCcZ6ovAI="}
