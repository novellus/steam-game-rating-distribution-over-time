I regret it [/h1]\n\nEvil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween might be remember on Steam for one thing and one thing only. It was the first video game ever to be released on Steam by Serbs. Being an effing Serb myself, I felt like it was my civil duty to buy this game (on sale) and support the developers. \nI tried hard to like this game but I just couldn’t.\n\n[h1] The sad truth about Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure (HOPA) games [/h1]\n\nWhile our neighbors in the north-west are making games like Serious Sam https://store.steampowered.com/app/41000/Serious_Sam_HD_The_First_Encounter/ and The Talos Principle https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/, us Serbs here are mostly stuck making, almost exclusively, HOPA games. Hopa games are an interesting breed of games. They mostly consist of really detailed still images, some texts and very light puzzle solving. I actually really like HOPA games. They can be a lot of fun. Not only are they relaxing to play but you can also give your brain a nice workout and even improve your vocabulary while searching for that one hidden item. \n\nThe problem is that… HOPA games are massively produced. Before Steam opened the floodgates of Greenlight and Direct it didn’t really have a lot of HOPA games. I’m not saying that HOPA games shouldn’t be on Steam but, if I was in the mood for a HOPA game, Steam wouldn’t be the first place to look for one.\n\nWebsites like BigFishGames are the main publishers/distributors of these games and they have so many of them. Not only that, but most HOPA games seem take place in a spooky mansion with eerie music and other generic creepy themes. \n\n[h1] The story about a boy who cares too much for Halloween [/h1]\n\nThe story in this game starts with a little boy reading a stolen Halloween book that tells the “Actual” story of Halloween. As he reads this book, a talking owl appears and persuades him to figure out the actual truth behind Halloween and its origins. Seeing how the boy doesn’t have anything better to do, he sets out on a journey to escape his house and figure things out.\n \n[h1] All HOPA games play this way [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay of this game, and all other hopa games, consists of you going through rooms, solving puzzles, collecting items and, most importantly, looking for hidden objects. While item collecting and exploring rooms is nothing unusual, looking for hidden objects is where the meat of HOPA games really is. Most rooms in this game consist of still beautifully drawn images with a lot of attention to detail. Whenever you see something unusual, out of place and sparkly, you should click on it. More often than not, you will click on a sparkly place and be sent to a window with a messed up pile of junk, but don’t be disgusted, because that’s what these games are about. You are supposed to find a list of items in this pile of junk and after you finish the list, you will be awarded with an item which will help you progress, at least, that’s the idea. The object is usually a key, a piece of a mechanism or something similar. \n\n[h1] Evil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween wants to be MORE than just another HOPA game [/h1]\n\nLike I mentioned above, most HOPA games are the same and it’s really hard to tell them apart. Publishers of HOPA games don’t want too much straying from the regular formula, not even when it comes to the theme. Thus, Evil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween also falls in the category of still images, spooky atmosphere and a few puzzles. BUT BUT BUT this game is on Steam, so the developers figured they could be a bit more innovative. So what did they do? Well, they made a hidden object game where I struggled to find hidden objects. Not because these objects were well hidden but because I didn’t have that many opportunities to actually go looking for them. Instead, I was stuck going through rooms, looking for a way to progress so that I can look for more objects.\n\n[h1] The developers seem really proud of their puzzles and clues. So proud that they didn’t even let me enjoy this game [/h1]\n\nI mentioned above that I find HOPA games relaxing. While they do have some puzzles thrown in, the majority of the game is relaxing as you search for specific things in huge piles of junk. OH, but not in here, oh no! I had to EARN the right to look through another pile of junk by figuring out what the developers were thinking when they made this game. See, instead of looking for hidden objects, like in most HOPA games, here, you will spend the majority of time figuring out what the clues actually mean and how to use this item with something in the environment. So, it sounds more like this game wanted to be a point-and-click adventure game instead of a HOPA, huh? Well, either way, it fails. The game fails as a HOPA game because it has huge walls of puzzles and progression before getting to the next hidden object section and it fails as a point-and-click adventure game because the puzzles aren’t very well made or explained. For instance, you have a book at all times, where the main character journals his experience. You are supposed to constantly look through this book and figure out, based on vague clues, where to go next. The developers really want you to stop, think and figure out where to go and what to do. While this would be admirable for a game like Myst, it’s just annoying here.\n\n[h1] Not even my wife liked this game [/h1]\n\nAs I was struggling to figure out where to go and what to do in this game, my wife came to the room and noticed I was playing a HOPA game. A smile appeared on her face as she sat on my lap and happily took the mouse away from me as HOPA games are something she also enjoys. We played this game together for about 30 minutes before I asked her: “Honey, are you even having fun?”, to which she said : “NO”. And that was that. That was the end of my time spent with this game. \n\nA little fact, the first games I ever played with my wife were, in fact, HOPA games and we have never had so much trouble with progressing through one. NOT EVEN AFTER LOOKING THROUGH A WALKTHROUGH did we manage to figure out how to progress and, again, we played a bunch of HOPA games in the past.\n\n[h1] Why isn’t this game just be another HOPA game? [/h1]\n\nThat’s all I (sorry, honey) WE wanted. WE wanted to support our country and just buy and play a simple HOPA game and Evil Pumpkin didn’t let us. It’s so proud of its own puzzles that not even its hint system, easiest difficulty and a walkthrough wasn’t able to help us progress. Yeah, did I mention that this game has difficulties, a hint system and even RPG mechanics? The difficulty is probably there just so it can make the hint system not work and even with that, it wouldn’t matter because the hint system is absolutely useless. It will just point you to the nearest puzzle whether you have the right item or not. And as for RPG mechanics. Well, you will have items that will level up after a number of uses. They won’t change or perform better… actually they won’t do anything differently… but it sounds cool when you say you have RPG mechanics, right?\n\n[h1] Just play a different HOPA game [/h1]\n\nOverall, this HOPA game isn’t worth it. Just go to BigFishGames and play a different one that will actually let you look for hidden objects.\n\nNext game: EXAPUNKS\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/716490/","timestamp_created":1590736901,"timestamp_updated":1590870553,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573091864585876465","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4msbRs/ICcu75igI="}
