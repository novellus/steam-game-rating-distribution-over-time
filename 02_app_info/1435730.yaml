      The Inertial Drift OST is a collaboration between UK broken beat legend Kaidi
      Tatham and NI electronic artist Kab Driver. Inspired by cult 90s arcade racers
      but spun out with contemporary production techniques and a distinct jazzy soul
      - it transports you to a 90s retro-future where the cars are fiercely individual,
      the tracks are demanding and your opponents are ruthless.
