    review: 'This is such a delightful little game!

      It reminded me of playing old tile-based games as a kid!


      The charming characters, monsters, and art style is so cute.


      + Tile-based roguelike game

      + Charming graphics and characters

      + Challenging!

      + Different weapons and magic abilities


      - Challenging (Will take you a few tries to beat)

      - No real save systems - true to traditional roguelike games.

      - Lack of character customisation or inventory checking.


      I would definitely recommend this game if you want a short and charming roguelike
      adventure!'
