      \ /><br><br>Encompassing the vast combined landmasses of both the Old World\
      \ and the New World, Mortal Empires enables you to embark upon colossal new\
      \ campaigns playing as any Legendary Lord from both games, including any introduced\
      \ Free content packs and any you own as DLC. Players will be able to embark\
      \ on campaigns as any of the 35 existing Legendary Lords from both games. This\
      \ includes the Dwarfs, Greenskins, Empire, Bretonnia, Wood Elves, High Elves,\
      \ Dark Elves, Beastmen, Warriors of Chaos, Skaven, Vampire Counts and Lizardmen.<br><br>Unlike\
      \ the Eye of The Vortex campaign that shipped with WARHAMMER II, Mortal Empires\
      \ doesn\u2019t focus on one overarching narrative. Instead, it offers the classic\
      \ sandbox Total War experience in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world, expanding\
      \ your empire in any direction you choose with no limits. You\u2019ll still\
      \ experience the escalating Chaos Warriors invasion from the original Total\
      \ War: WARHAMMER Old World campaign, but with an exciting new twist: the forces\
      \ of Chaos don\u2019t just attack from the Chaos Wastes, but from other, unexpected\
      \ directions as well\u2026 <br><br>Mortal Empires also features many of the\
      \ new campaign features introduced in Total War: WARHAMMER II. These include\
      \ treasure-hunting in ruins and encounters at sea; rogue armies, loyalty, rites\
      \ and army abilities for the four New World races; new chokepoint battle maps;\
      \ storms at sea; reefs and shallows; universal territory capture; plus numerous\
      \ UI improvements and enhancements.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617810/extras/GIF3.JPG?t=1601638186\"\
      \ /><br><br>Mortal Empires is a bespoke new campaign map, not an exact reflection\
      \ of the Old World and Eye of The Vortex campaign maps. As such, certain factions\
      \ have unique new starting positions. The Skaven warlord Queek Headtaker of\
      \ Clan Mors, for example, begins with ownership of Karag Orrud in the south-eastern\
      \ Badlands. This puts him in the heart of Greenskin territory in the Old World."
