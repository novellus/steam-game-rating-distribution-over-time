    about_the_game: "Accompany Leona in a clever puzzle adventure to save the inhabitants\
      \ of a strange but lovely world. Featuring fresh puzzle mechanics, wonderful\

      \ game composer Chris Huelsbeck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeona\u2019s Tricky Adventures\
      \ is inspired by a clever puzzle game mechanic which was briefly explored in\
      \ the very early 90s but sadly faded from prominence shortly after. The basic\
      \ task is to match two increasingly complex patterns using increasingly complex\
      \ mechanics. While it can\u2019t be directly compared to any contemporary game\
      \ the mental skills required by the puzzles put them somewhere in between &quot;Picross&quot;\
      \ and &quot;Bejeweled&quot; \u2013 and in our humble opinion they can easily\
      \ stand up against those games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll puzzles are embedded\
      \ in a big and complex overworld full of exploration and humorous citizens constructed\
      \ entirely using beautifully hand-drawn pixel graphics. Exploration and puzzle-solving\
      \ is intertwined in clever and varied ways which draw you deeper into the game\
      \ world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComicmakers M.Musal/B.Samuel provided the story\
      \ and dialogue for Leona's world to make the storytelling and humorous aspects\
      \ of the game just as compelling as the gameplay itself. The story is an integral\
      \ part of the game and the overworld design directly builds on it to form a\
      \ coherent product that is more than the sum of its parts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nTo match the quality of the gameplay, Chris Huelsbeck and Fabian DelPriore\
      \ composed a magnificient soundtrack as well as M.Musal/B.Samuel prepared al\

    review: "Esse jogo \xE9 uma esp\xE9cie de Remake do jogo Gem'X , lan\xE7ado para\
      \ Amiga em 1991. Gem'X foi feito pela Kaiko que era um time de 3 alem\xE3es\
      \ que tentavam se passar por japoneses fazendo jogos com apar\xEAncia de japoneses.\
      \ Ele tinha conte\xFAdo \"Hentai\" porque voc\xEA via meninas nuas (anime) quando\
      \ passava de fase. N\xE3o tem nada disso aqui.  \n\nDo time original, apenas\
      \ o m\xFAsico trabalho nesse remake. E \xE9 o que precisava, a trilha sonora\
      \ do lend\xE1rio Chris Huelsbeck era incr\xEDvel no original, e aqui \xE9 novamente\
      \ absurdamente excelente, com remixes das m\xFAsicas do jogo original e m\xFA\
      sicas novas. Numa promo\xE7\xE3o, o jogo vale s\xF3 pela trilha sonora pra mim.\
      \ \n\nO jogo tem uma historinha mas n\xE3o tem nada de RPG aqui ou algo do tipo\
      \ como pode parecer. \xC9 um jogo de puzzle, voc\xEA tem que deixar o lado esquerdo\
      \ da tela igual o lado direito. As regras pra isso s\xE3o simples de entender,\
      \ mas complexas demais para serem explicadas aqui. N\xE3o tem tempo e voc\xEA\
      \ pode pular fases em que voc\xEA ficar preso, ent\xE3o n\xE3o tem frustra\xE7\
      \xE3o de ficar numa tela sem saber a solu\xE7\xE3o. \xC9 um puzzle cl\xE1ssico,\
      \ no sentido que existe um conjunto de regras fechado e espec\xEDfico e voc\xEA\
      \ tem que , usando essas regras, solucionar cada tela. Eu achava o Gem'X genial\
      \ e incrivelmente divertido, e essa \xE9 uma vers\xE3o \"relaxada\" do Gem'X,\
      \ sem limite de tempo e vidas, ent\xE3o eu achei um jogo incrivelmente bom.\
      \ Os gr\xE1ficos s\xE3o bem simples, BEM simples mesmo, beirando ao amadorismo,\
      \ mas o jogo \xE9 muito legal e eu recomendo ainda mais se voc\xEA puder comprar\
      \ barato.\n\n"
