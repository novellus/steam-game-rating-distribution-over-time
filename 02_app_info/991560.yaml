    review: 'Hey, do you like popular anime series One Punch Man? Do you like loading
      screens? THEN HAVE I GO A GAME FOR YOU!


      Seriously though, this game is a hot mess. There''s a lot of baffling design
      decisions you could spend a lot of time discussing and not even get close to
      the actual fighting mechanics of this fighting game. But for me the breakpoint
      was the loading times. And to be clear I''m not exactly running a potato here.
      But the amount of time you spend in this game just waiting to do things. Start
      the game, wait for it load, change areas, wait for that to load, run over to
      the pc who''s giving out missions and the wait for them to load in as well.
      Then wait for the mission select screen and then, finally, you can wait for
      the actual fight to load. And you better hope you''re not doing a story mission
      because get what happens if there''s any cutscenes or additional stages? The
      problem with all this hanging around is that the actual fights can be over in
      less time than it takes to get them. And honestly they''re... not that great.
      I''m no connoisseur of fighting games, but it mostly seems to come down to whoever
      stun locks or juggle combos the other person first. Can be OK as a bit of button
      mashing fun, except it''s simply not worth the wait.


      The character creator deserves a mention as it''s actually pretty good. Not
      quite City Of Heroes (RIP) levels of great, but pretty much everything you fight
      in game is made with it so it does provide some variety. But honestly it could
      do with more options for making actual super heroes. Even most of the unlockable
      options are just normal clothes.


      There''s several pieces of DLC and I did get the season pass, but honestly they
      don''t seem to add much to the game. There''s only one that I even got as far
      as accessing the missions for and they''re just like what you get in the main
      game: A couple of short fights against random monsters and maybe after you''ll
      get some extra costume pieces or whatever assuming you have the patience to
      wait for them to LOAD.


      The weird tacked on online features are honestly not even worth talking about
      since they don''t really seem to impact the game in any meaningful way. Outside
      of the strange hub structure of the town. It''s like they wanted this to be
      an MMO or something, but had no clue how that would even work with a fighting
      game. The answer there being it doesn''t, concentrate on something the game
      actually needs. Like optimisation.'
