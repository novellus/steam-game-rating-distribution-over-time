Complete waste of money.  It should be withdrawn from the market until it is more than a shell of a game.\n\nThe tech tree is extremely thin.  Only 3 branches, and a depth of 5-10 in each of the sub elements.  Dull.\n\nThe ability to customise fleets is poor, limited to the balance of 6 standard ship classes from corvette to dread.  No ability to customise ships, just general upgrades to attack/defence/speed/cost as one of the 3 tech tree branches.\n\nIt's very buggy. Frequently, the game hangs and sometimes you can recover by restarting, but not always.","timestamp_created":1606980468,"timestamp_updated":1606980468,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547924399375915527","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0v/fk/YCcuv3tgI="}
