The resolution was clipped (right side was covered where all the accept/cancel buttons tend to be), and scrolling in menus is laggy. There is a community patch to resolve windows 10 issues. The patch is basically somebodys shoddy dll files to override local ones. They solved the scrolling issue for me, but not the clipped resolution. Sadly, unplayable, but others have had luck with it.","timestamp_created":1609104284,"timestamp_updated":1609104284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwltuF0/YCdKPxvQI="}
