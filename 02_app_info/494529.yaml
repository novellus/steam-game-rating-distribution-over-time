    review: "Basically I've steered clear of this DLC due to earlier complaints but\
      \ now that i acquired it, I've changed my outlook.\n\nThis DLC is pretty good,\
      \ to grasp how good it really is, before you buy it, sit back, give your self\
      \ a couple of hours to read fully the 266 page manual . then you see how sophisticated\
      \ and detailed this plane really is. \n\nIf you'd like to really control it\
      \ go buy it and see what I mean. if you just want to jump in the pilots seat\
      \ and fly about then do that as well.\n\nAll in all this is a really comprehensive\
      \ plane. the developers have gone into great detail on this one."
