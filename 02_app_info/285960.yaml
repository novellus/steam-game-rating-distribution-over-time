    about_the_game: "<strong>Q*bert is Back  @!#?@! </strong><br><br>One of the most\
      \ critically acclaimed and commercially successful arcade games of the 1980s\
      \ is back in its Classic pixel perfect 2D form, and a re-imagined Reboot version\
      \ with state of the art 3D game-play and graphics that remain faithful to the\
      \ original concept. Both versions are exciting twitch games requiring keen puzzle\
      \ solving skills and logic. <br><br>First introduced in 1982 by Gottlieb, Q*bert\
      \ was critically-acclaimed and went on to become the third most successful arcade\
      \ game of all time (behind Pac-Man and Donkey Kong). It inspired home versions,\
      \ a variety of Q*bert merchandise, numerous copycat games and even an animated\
      \ TV series. <br><br>Q*bert Classic stays true to the original in all its jagged\
      \ 2D pixel art glory, now optimized for the modern PC with mouse and Steam gamepad\
      \ controls. As the title character, players jump around an isometric cube pyramid\
      \ and convert each block\u2019s color while avoiding familiar adversaries Coily,\
      \ Ugg, Slick, Sam, Wrong Way and Red Ball. Levels become progressively harder\
      \ with more enemies blocking your path and the tiles requiring multiple jumps\
      \ to change to the required color.<br><br>Q*bert Rebooted takes the arcade classic\
      \ and catapults it into the 21st century 3D game play that takes full advantage\
      \ of today\u2019s technologies yet remains faithful to the original Q*bert.\
      \ Featuring hexagonal blocks instead of squares, Q*bert Rebooted introduces\
      \ new enemies, playable characters, power-ups, traps, gem collecting and characters,\
      \ and new ways to play. <br><br><strong>Q*bert Rebooted highlights:</strong><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Level Select \u2013 replay all previously unlocked levels\
      \ and track progress against friends.<br></li><li>7 New Playable Characters\
      \ \u2013 introducing Q*zard, Q*bertha, Q*bot, Q*zilla, Q*tee, Q*knight and Q*nicorn,\
      \ all based on the original Q*bert form.<br></li><li>3 New Enemies \u2013 the\
      \ classic cast of adversaries are joined by new enemies Homer, Uppercut and\
      \ Treasure Chest<br></li><li>9 Achievements \u2013 these include Classic Master,\
      \ Newbert, Qbertorama, Snake Surprise, Green Machine, Ugg!, Down for the Count,\

    review: 'OMG - They have made the already frustrating control scheme multiple
      times worse!


      Digital pads are way too easy to throw Q*Bert straight up or down when you mean
      to jump in a diagonal


      ....and the analogue stick simply won''t move until you hit the extremely small
      sweet spot for the direction you are attempting; imagine three Coilys on the
      screen at once barrelling down on you and you can''t move!


      An autotargeting assist feature is required; auto jumping the player in the
      most sensible direction taking consideration the player''s input at that place
      and time.


      I''m also curious as to why so many enemies drop onto the stage at one time
      and at VERY questionable moments...it feels a bit ''Ha ha, F**k you!'''
