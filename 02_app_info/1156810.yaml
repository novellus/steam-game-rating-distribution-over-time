    developer_response: Thank you for your comment. The processing of Oculus Touch
      and Xbox Controller is almost the same implementation. Please tell me the buttons
      that do not work. I would like to try to improve.

    review: 'Works but is cumbersome since keypresses on the XBOX controller only
      work some

      of the time and maybe not the same way every time. Has potential if it is worked
      on

      Right now I''d say no unless you''re just curious .'
