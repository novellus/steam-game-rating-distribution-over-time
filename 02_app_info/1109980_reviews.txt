Should not be sold in its current state.\n\nAfter a brief intro, I was placed into the game proper. I was in 3rd-person mode, camera behind my avatar, standing in a mountain pass, snow on the ground, screams in the air. So far so good. Adventure! I took three steps, and my 3D screen was suddenly blocked by a giant 2D banner that read (all formatting and capitalization original):\n\nThe village was completely surrounded,\nwomen and children fled to the mountains.\n\nthe remaining minority is\ninsufficient for the defense.\n\nKill all the looters from the\nelf armies. \n\nNo keypress, no mouse click, no movement would remove the banner; although I could still move, all I could see were my feet and the top of my head. ESC worked to get me into the options menu, and there I found another glitch: one of the options pages has no BACK button, leaving you stuck on it forever.\n\nIf the developer cares to fix these issues and make the game playable, I will take another look.
