    review: "Do you like Match 3 games?  Do you like farming games?  Well then \"\
      Hope's Farm\" is a match made in heaven for you!  This game combines the normal\
      \ match 3 gameplay and adds lite farming that you have to do before you can\
      \ go onto the next match 3 round.  The items that you are matching are part\
      \ of an \"order\" the farm has received.  Like person A wants 45 tomatoes, person\
      \ B wants 50 cucumbers, person C wants 4 cartons of milk.  In the beginning\
      \ you have only a couple crops and a fruit tree.  Click on the tomato patch\
      \ and a water bucket appears, drag that over the field to water it.  In a few\
      \ seconds the crop will grow.  To harvest it, just hover your mouse over the\
      \ crop and a sickle appears, drag that over it to harvest the crop.  Harvested\
      \ crops go into Storage and you only have so much room so don't get carried\
      \ away stocking up on corn.  Once your \"order\" match 3 game has been successfully\
      \ played you get star points.  Once you have enough star points you get an upgrade\
      \ such as more crops and eventually chickens, cows, pigs, and sheep.  \n\nWhen\
      \ you run out of water from watering your crops you play the water game.  In\
      \ one corner of the board is a icon with water beneath it, similar to the game\
      \ The Four Elements.  The rest of the board has got a dirt background that you\
      \ dig away by matching over it. At the bottom of the screen is a Well.  Make\
      \ a path from the water to the well to finish.\n\nThe match 3 game part has\
      \ the typical bonus items that you get from matching four in a row or five in\
      \ a row.  In this game you get a firecracker that eliminates things in a cross\
      \ (up, down, left, right) around the firecracker.  Match 5 to get a bomb that\
      \ eliminates a square 3x3 blocks.  In addition to those are three bonus items\
      \ you can use at any time: a shovel that will remove one square, (I'm having\
      \ brain fog and can't remember the second one), and thirdly a Lightning Bolt\
      \ that will remove all of the same item like all the corn disappears.   You\
      \ can use those any time but they are limited in number initially and can be\
      \ purchased by some form of currency (blue stars?) that you only have so much\
      \ of and get more by completing levels.\n\nThe graphics are cutesy and bright.\
      \  The background music sound like old time folk music with banjos and harmonicas.\
      \  It's pleasant and has a down home feel to it.\n\nPrice seems reasonable for\
      \ this genre.  I bought it on sale.\n\nI'd say this is one of the good ones\
      \ in the genre, as long as you like the farming aspect because you will be doing\
      \ a lot of it.  If you don't care for farming you might find that part tedious.\
      \  I have not completed the game yet and wonder what happens at the end once\
      \ you have all the crops and animals.  I can see the urge to play the game again\
      \ from the beginning once one has finished, so there may be replay value.  Total\
      \ time to finish all 100 order (levels) is about 11 hours.  Not bad."
