I found Two Digits more manageable, but with this one I would often just resort to random combinations until I uncovered something helpful. I guess One Digit would be more my speed.\n\nOn a more objective note, I have some technical complaints about the game. The game could use a back button and a quit button, so that it could be fully mouse-controlled. Music settings aren't carried between sessions, so you'll need to mute it or turn it down every time (at least I did, I found the music insufferable), volume settings often reset to max when you leave the settings screen. Achievements don't trigger when you've satisfied their condition, first you need to quit the game, restart it and quit again. I appreciate the final three puzzles being so simple for the sake of winding down the effort or just rushing to the finish, but it could've been done better than two of the three being identical.","timestamp_created":1589184510,"timestamp_updated":1589209528,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512012004852294922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7J6RgvICcpyAhwI="}
