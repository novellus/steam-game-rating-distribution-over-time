      /><br>In the dim and distant past, Tanabe Eiji was a promising young writer,
      well-known for his poem Fireworks, which detailed the beginnings of his youthful
      and idealistic romance with his wife, Sachiko.<br><br>Twenty years later, however,
      Eiji's life has lost much of its shine. His poems, save for Fireworks, have
      fallen into obscurity, while his first (and last) novel was critically panned
      for being too depressing. Worse still, his relationship with his wife has started
      to stagnate.<br><br>In a desperate attempt to rekindle his lost creativity,
      Eiji embarks on a journey to the snowy mountains of Hakuba.<br><br>During his
      six day stay at the Azami Inn, an old and lonely building in the middle of nowhere,
      Eiji meets the inn's proprietress, the stern and indomitable Miss Kakiuchi,
      and her unwordly daughter, Reiko.<br><br>Eiji isn't sure why, exactly, but something
      about Reiko catches his attention. Though he tries to resist, he finds himself
      drawn to her charms all the same.<br><br>Could Reiko be his muse, who will inspire
      him to pen another masterpiece? Or will his obsession with her ruin the both
      of them?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754810/extras/2.png?t=1568938962"

    review: 3 hours well spent. Really, this VN is quite unique on its own and its
      artstyle attracts me in a way I cannot explain. The story, albeit quite short,
      is well-written and the pacing is good. The epilogue is, although relieving,
      I still feel like its missing something. Give this one a try, you don't know
      if you might like it if you haven't tried it. And for the low low price of 0$,
      what is there to lose anyway?
