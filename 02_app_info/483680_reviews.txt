But hey it's free and for that price it's pretty cool already. I've spent about 10 minutes on this game thus far, and so far I seem to be liking it. I appreiciate how different it is from all the other VR titles; I personally don't know any other game that let's you create your own tune in VR! I'll update this when I have a chance to play more. But overall, I recommend this, as it's creative and unique in it's own right. AN√ÅLISE DE ACESSO ANTECIPADO PUBLICADA: 4 DE SETEMBRO DE 2016\nFun free music experience. The 7.1, I think, is used great. You create different music crystals with the trigger finger, make them come into contact with each other, they start creating a beat already chosen by the game, then you can grab them and throw them in any direction to make that sound come from that direction. Then pull out more crystals and do the same thing. If you don't like the sound of one of them, you can pop them by stabbing them with your controller. There aren't too many different sounds created, hopefully that will expand. It does seem like the same song can be recreated. What I had fun with is just using 1 or maybe a small dose of a second crystal and placing the crystals like they are the instrument. For example, there was one sound that sounded like someone humming something briefly, and another sound that sounded like someone snapping their fingers. So I placed the crystals where a persons mouth would be for humming and a persons hands would be for snapping. Then the drum sounds I placed behind me where a drum set often is located on stage. I put water droplet sounds on the floor. I enjoyed it and since its free, nothing but thumbs up!\n","timestamp_created":1486410585,"timestamp_updated":1486410585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4urK+itoCdbK9cQ=="}
