It's an extremely fun game, but there are soo many bugs. I've never played a game with so many inconsistancies. Ive reported about 30 in my 26 hours of play, no response to any of them.\n\nEdit: Developer does communicate frequently, but the game is not playable. I cannot go more than one run without getting a game breaking bug that makes the run cake, or stops the run in it's tracks. Which is a shame, because if everything was fixed, I think it'd be one of the best Deckbuilding video games out there.","timestamp_created":1605336934,"timestamp_updated":1609144499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1605882763,"developer_response":"Hey, I just wanted to mention that I have seen the bug reports. I just have not had much time to work through them yet. I know this doesn't make up for not solving things sooner, but being the solo developer who works full time in health care industry and a new parent, I am having some trouble balancing my time at the moment. \n\nBut I am monitoring things and working on them as I have time. I really do appreciate the feedback, it really does help me create a better game!\nCheers,\nLuigi"}],"cursor":"AoJ4s4+f1PYCeYSirgI="}
