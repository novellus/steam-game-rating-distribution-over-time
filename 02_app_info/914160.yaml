    review: 'Zup! Arena is a simple arena fighter where you are trying to knock everyone
      out and be the last to survive. As much as I''d like to enjoy this game I can
      not recommend anyone getting this game even if it''s free now. We need workshop
      so we can make our own maps and we need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/914160/discussions/0/1741105805761273496/]bots[/url]
      added so we can at least play, as of now you can only play when you have people
      and the game lacks that. You can buy loot boxes with the coins you earn in-game
      and open them for free to get hats, emots, face, color, accessories.


      If you are interested in Steam inventory items this game has coin drops after
      each match, more for kills and being the winner then you can buy loot chests
      with them and get items. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873140323]Steam
