It's got an interesting setting that's different enough from the main game to feel exciting, while not straying too far (in my opinion) to feel disconnected. Its setup as a new hub of locations to explore (rather than a more linear narrative like some of the DLC), with a ton of interesting optional content, made this one a joy to play through. Its strange characters might certainly be too much for some people, feeling a bit Wacky Wasteland all the way through, and even annoyed me at first, but I quickly grew to it and it ended up being one of my favourite parts of the DLC, truly making it feel alive.\n\nDefinite recommend!","timestamp_created":1609730021,"timestamp_updated":1609730021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46NrY5fYCcLKjwAI="}
