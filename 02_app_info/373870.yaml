    about_the_game: "For as long as humanity existed, there has been an ancient order\
      \ which prevented the dark forces from taking over the world. The order's name\
      \ might have changed as the centuries wore on, but its essence remained the\
      \ same. They were called &quot;guardians,&quot; and our story is about the kids\
      \ of one particular guardian. One day, fearing for their lives, he left his\
      \ kids at the doorstep of an orphanage on the other side of the world. This\
      \ is where our story begins...<br>The abandoned twin sisters were named Ariel\
      \ and Belle. They didn't remember their parents, nor how they ended up in the\
      \ orphanage. From the start they weren't like other kids. The girls really loved\
      \ one another and were inseparable. They could predict the future, notice details\
      \ that most people overlooked, and hear voices no one else could hear...<br>Visions\
      \ haunted them throughout their childhood - strange apparitions, like echoes\
