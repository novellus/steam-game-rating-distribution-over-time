    review: "[i]''Art is an expression of who we are, what we believe and what we\
      \ dream about'' - Julianne Moore[/i]\n\n[u]Don't go into this expecting a 'game'\
      \ or you will be very disappointed instead see [b]Brain 43\u2103[/b] for what\
      \ it is: artistic expression[/u]\n\nWhat first attracted me to Brain 43\u2103\
      \ was the black & white artwork which achieved what every artist aims for: it\
      \ evoked a curiousity to discover more of what this project offers.\n \nAfter\
      \ journeying through the 20+minute showcase I immediately saw that the Developer\
      \ had taken a variety of techniques to get across a message, using Formalist\
      \ Art, of moral improvement.  \n\nIn Brain 43\u2103, you as the Player are invited\
      \ to consider the two mediums of art & poetry in a philosophical way. \nThe\
      \ developer also makes use of allegory with one example that I found very original\
      \ & effective being a scene where you see artwork of a girl wearing a raincoat\
      \ & holding an umbrella yet it only rains under that umbrella. It says something\
      \ along the lines of: why does she hold the umbrella & she replies because I\
      \ have a raincoat. \nThat is a beautiful way of stating 'perception' since the\
      \ girl's mentality is: she cannot see a way beyond the rain so she accepts it\
      \ & lives with it - a perfect allegory of a state of mind or mental state. \n\
      \nA final example being a girl who sits by a Lotus flower waiting for it to\
      \ blossom who is asked why she waits? This isn't immediately clear until we\
      \ see the outcome for the girl. \nNow this could be interpreted as meaning 'patience\
      \ offers reward' or a direct allegory of having the desire to perservere. \n\
      \nThis is the journey you can expect from Brain 43\u2103 and it is clever in\
      \ its design because no one person can really interpret the same way.\n\nIf\
      \ you are interested in art & philosophy this project can offer you a short\
      \ experience to revel in that. It offers reflection in many ways, I say this\
      \ because I think many things can make you reflect not only through philosophy\
      \ but also in a song's lyrics & sound, artwork in its colour and subject or\
      \ a good novel/movie/drama.\n\nUsually I would recommend Brain 43\u2103 for\
      \ its originality and its messages but I think until it is improved upon with\
      \ the following suggestions I can't recommend it just yet.\n\n[i]Suggestions\
      \ to improve are[/i]: I feel it is held back by what a 'Gamer' expects and the\
      \ main thing that stands out is the price which I personally feel is too high\
      \ for what this artistic endeavour offers. There are others on Steam similar\
      \ to this for a fraction of the price so this will deter many from taking a\
      \ chance on this project.\n\nThe lesser issues that will be spotted by 'Gamers'\
      \ is the unusual choice to have the 'player' have to delete the save-data from\
      \ their directory folder to replay it which involves 'effort' and let's be honest\
      \ the least 'effort' needed for the 'player' the more likely it will be enjoyed.\n\
      \nFinally, there are some minor misspellings BUT considering this was designed\
      \ & written with English as a second language I feel it can be too easy to critique\
      \ this. Others may argue that there are plenty of translation tools but it's\
      \ much easier to be a critic than to offer assistance. Personally I think the\
      \ misspellings don't leave the intended message 'lost in translation'.\n\nI\
      \ did wonder if it were worth adding music to the sound effects but I can see\
      \ why music wasn't used as this Project's approach relies on evoking a reaction\
      \ and music is one of the top ways of getting this. Why else is music loved\
      \ by everyone? So in using music excessively it can detract from evoking the\
      \ intended messages.\n\nThis famous quote should be considered because I do\
      \ admire the effort in this art project & I hope it does get updated especially\
      \ in its price.\n\n[b]''What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?''\
      \ - Vincent van Gogh[/b]\n\n~~~Liked what you see? You can find more at[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32839633/]\
