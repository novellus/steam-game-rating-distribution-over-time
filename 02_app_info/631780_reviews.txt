(Word to the wise: just cough up for \"The Whole Box\". It's well worth it.)\n\n   Obviously this is only going to be a smart purchase - especially at full price - for those who have a particular interest in game development. But boy oh boy, the fly-on-the-wall insight you're getting here; especially if you're contemplating working for a [i]company[/i], of any size or description. It's not quite blow-by-blow - and who'd want it to be! - but as edited sequences of events go, you're certainly seeing a lot of detail. (Almost TOO much at times!)\n\n   Then there's the [i]prototypes[/i]! Yep, that's right, you even get to play the game prototypes that were made as part of the fortnight-long experimentation periods. So yes: the value is most definitely here, and it's a downright bargain if you can find it all for sale.\n\n   A strong recommendation to all aspiring and amateur devs, whether your interest lies in AAA, \"indie\" companies, or even truly \"independent\" game-making by yourself or in small teams.\n\n   Verdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1575071520,"timestamp_updated":1575106185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631242811679840088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48qDp3e4CeqXe3wE="}
