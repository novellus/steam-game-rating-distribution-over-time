      \ countries to sell their goods profitably and make all kinds of purchases.\
      \ But this is not all. What is the fair without magicians, acrobats, comedians,\
      \ and other artists? In short, fans of different wonders will find something\
      \ to see. Zaporozhian Cossacks also gathered at the fair. Recent campaign was\
      \ very successful. The journey was long and dangerous, but everything went well\
      \ so far. Lead Cossacks intact and visit this grandiose festival."
