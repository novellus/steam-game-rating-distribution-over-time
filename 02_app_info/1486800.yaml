    review: No instructions at all. I wanted to love this game so much. I enjoy the
      Viking version but High Noon & Shinobi have me stumped. I do not at all understand
      what the other pieces are doing, can do or will do. I understand some pieces
      are supposed to be rooks, bishops & queen. I have no idea WHO they are. The
      little indecipherable video tutorial is useless. I cannot see a difference in
      any of the pieces in the "help" video. I do not know WHY pieces shoot, how they
      shoot or when they can shoot. So it is impossible to know if I am making a correct
      move or not. Why does the gun go off when I am 3x3 squares away diagonally but
      NOT when I am 1 square away horizontally. I'd think shooting the bad guy in
      the face would be an option. Guns do work at point blank range. As there are
      no instructions I cannot recommend this game. In fact I find the lack of any
      instruction at all as to the goal or mechanics that I can honestly say I think
      this game is absolutely terrible & no one should waste even a single dollar
      on it. If you can be bothered to put up a bad video attempt at a tutorial then
      you can also have a simple text screen explaining the goal of the game is to
      avoid capture, shoot enemies or capture the flag. As for what happens with the
      guns I really do not understand. They just happen, these cowboys did not take
      gun safety class & shoot from the hip at random. They frankly all deserve to
      die in a Mexican Standoff.
