Exit is not as tightly designed as its predecessor and suffers because of it, the jump dodge is incredibly overpowered and easy to abuse, and enemy bullet patterns are far more erratic than they used to be. The variety in weapons is lost when, not only are there significantly less weapons as it is, but some weapons don't function as they used to. Now some weapons are simply weaker or stronger versions of other weapons you might get. I don't mind the blessing system at all, but since the weapons aren't unique anymore as long as you hold M1 towards your enemy you'll keep doing damage. It's not only the weapons that are limited now, but the enemies and items too. After only 11 hours of play, I've seen almost everything Exit has to offer, Enter has 10x as much content to see. Finally, for some reason a lot of the art in this game looks really strange compared to the much better looking style in Enter.\n\nThat said, I am recommending this game. Even after all that, in a void Exit The Gungeon is a perfectly fine game, it just struggles to live up to the first. If you're a fan of the original and you want to see how the story ends, it's a solid 10 hour experience, just don't expect it to be as good as Enter The Gungeon.","timestamp_created":1610056069,"timestamp_updated":1610056069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+L207/YCfamxwQI="}
