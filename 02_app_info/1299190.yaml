    review: 'This game is just fun. Can''t really get enough of it for some odd reason.
      This DLC, on the other hand, is a let down:


      In the first screenshot you see the three mercs that come in this dlc. This
      was an easy purchase because the screenshot displays a legendary quality Lili
      and a legendary quality Moss. You do not receive a legendary quality Lili. You
      do not receive a legendary quality Moss. I wonder if it would be possible to
      retroactively fix this mistake? It would be nice to receive what I was led to
      believe I would be paying for.
