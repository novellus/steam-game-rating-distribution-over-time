      /><br><br>Snake vs Snake is a fast paced snake game with an insane battle mode
      with power-ups, boss fights and much more. Inspired by old classical Snake but
      with a much faster arcade pace and local multiplayer support.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Local
      Multiplayer</strong></h2>1 - 6 Players can battle it out in the battle mode.
      Use power-ups to defeat the other Snakes. Got no one to play with? Don''t worry
      you can play against Snake AI players.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Online Multiplayer?</strong></h2>
      The game itself doesn''t support multiplayer but works well with services like
      Parsec where you can play online with your friends.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Leaderboard</strong></h2>Compete
      with other players from around the world and reach the #1 spot. Prove once and
      for all that you are the best Snake player in the world.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Classical
      Endless Mode</strong></h2>Fun like in the good old days; just keep going as
      long as you can.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Level Mode</strong></h2>Beat puzzle
      inspired levels by collecting all apples. Don''t hit any of the walls. Sounds
      easy? Well it''s not as easy as it sounds!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Speed Run
      Support</strong></h2>Beat all levels as fast as possible and see if you can
      become the fastest player in the world.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Controls</strong></h2>Works
      with gamepad &amp; keyboard, yes 4 players on the same keyboard, it''s crazy
      but fun :)'
