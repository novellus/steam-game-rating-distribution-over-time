That would be okay, if the gameplay was good. But already in the first room the absence of user friendly playability makes it hard to get in the game. The music could also be better (to raise the athmosphere) but doesn´t get into a symbiosis with the game. \n\nOverall the game makes it very hard to feel comfortable. Instead of using the mouse for everything (walk, take, use, inventory) like all the other games since at least a decade do, it throws you back to a time, when every action had it´s own button. So the paste is very slow, actions take much longer and this really is an issue for you will have to do try and error a lot because not even the normal hints in the game are done very clearly. And for a puzzle game, try and error is okay at some point, but not too much cause it feels like guessing, rather than working with an idea.\n\nIf you can overlook the missing standard comfort functions, you do not need an athmospherical setup and it is on sale, you might give it a try -  and maybe if you do not expect too much. I was deeply disappointed because of reviews I read and expected a lot more.\n","timestamp_created":1552943796,"timestamp_updated":1552943796,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8rmqyekCdIOtvQE="}
