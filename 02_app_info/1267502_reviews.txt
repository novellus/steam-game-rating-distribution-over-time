It's a very detailed and good-looking route, quite long, and not laggy either. One thing I really like is that in the included scenarios, there are a range of different seasons to choose from, which completely change the appearance of the route - summer, rainy and overcast, snowy and colourful autumn.","timestamp_created":1606146330,"timestamp_updated":1606146330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2YHy+vUCd82KsAI="}
