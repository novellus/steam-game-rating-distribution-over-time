    detailed_description: <h1>FAQ</h1><p><ul class="bb_ul">   <li><h2 class="bb_tag">What
      games are similar to Arakion?</h2> The core of Arakion is based on Blobber RPGs.
      With that said, Arakion takes inspiration from many games including Might and
      Magic, Dark Cloud 2, Dungeon Master and many more to create a truly unique experience.<br>   </li><li><h2
      class="bb_tag">What Languages Does Arakion Support?</h2>Arakion officially supports
      only English. However, you can access Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Italian, Dutch,
      Spanish, French and German in various states of translation. Almost all text
      will be Translated while some will be manually translated and some machine translated.<br>   </li><li><h2
      class="bb_tag">Is Arakion turn-based or real-time?</h2> Update Two+ (currently
      in [beta]) includes both!<br>   </li><li><h2 class="bb_tag">How many people
      are developing Arakion?</h2> Arakion is primarily developed by one person.<br>   </li><li><h2
      class="bb_tag">Arakion has been in development for a while, what took so long?</h2>
      I chose to take the time to develop a quality product and engine as opposed
      to rushing Arakion to market. I was either going to do it right or not do it
      at all. Players deserve a quality game, no matter how much time it takes.</p><br><h1>About

    short_description: Arakion is a new take on the first-person crawler genre. Similar
      to Grimrock, with a healthy dose of Might and Magic, and a pinch of Fable, players
      progress through this fairytale-like world solving puzzles, slaying monsters,
      and rebuilding!

    review: "Minigames, check. Puzzles, in full force. Crafting and hunger too.  An\
      \ immersive adventure of intoxicating fantasy elements with the respect and\
      \ adoration of blobbers from gaming lore. Turnbased or real time grid movement\
      \ and combat, this one man DEV has made quite a peculiar yet familiar little\
      \ gem.\n\nWhile not complete, Arakion Book One is still playable and one can\
      \ see the ambition and ideas behind all that is unfinished. But what is good\
      \ about what is there STILL does not convey a project with direction, because\
      \ it is difficult to estimate a serious connotation of execution from my perspective.\
      \ Just hopping on the wagon now, I have seen earlier builds and read previous\
      \ reviews and they don't appear to be congruent to what is the latest build\
      \ now, which is all fine and alright, it being early access, but it is a trying\
      \ time to determine what is under construction and what is permanent even with\
      \ the cryptic content of certain puzzles or mechanics.\n\nIt is a wonderful\
      \ little world, so far, and many brilliant views of sentimental RPG qualities\
      \ from yesteryear. The game is grid based although could very well improve by\
      \ \"freeing\" the movement similar to Bards Tale IV has done, simply put, I\
      \ am not quite sure how much the DEV is standing firmly on the current environment,\
      \ as it's points of interest are sometimes not entirely centered to the players\
      \ viewpoint ie. they fall between the center of 2 grids.\nIt happens enough\
      \ to notice.\n\nDue to the independent nature, the game is missing so much more\
      \ of the finesse that usually punctuates the menus and text of similar games\
      \ detailing such wondrous looking worlds. A contrivance to me personally, as\
      \ the game deserves that added touch and I know and hope that the DEV has it\
      \ within to make that special atmospheric flair that would embellish significantly,\
      \ not looking for Disney quality but merely bells and whistles along the lines\
      \ of on screen notifications, item descriptions, battle log, menu sounds, ease\
      \ of access etc. Yes I want to see this game come to fruition and this would\
      \ most likely come near the end of development. \n\nIt is very cool and sophisticated\
      \ , this pays homage to my favorite genre. This is one to watch and worth it\
      \ as is now but know that it is a work in progress that could only improve and\
      \ surprise!"
