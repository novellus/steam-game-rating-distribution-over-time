I understand that making a game is not easy but at least be honest with your community instead of attempting to vindicate poor business practices. No matter how hard you attempt to spin it you are a business and the players are the ones who have invested in you. If you wish to do it as a hobby don't put it up for sale on a formal store front with the promise of being a full fledged game.","timestamp_created":1594591786,"timestamp_updated":1594591786,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwfbEovMCcbfzlAI="}
