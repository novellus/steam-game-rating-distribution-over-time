It does have similarities to Sega's Hang On. \nIf you looking for some nostalgia in the arcade realm of gaming, this is one you should buy. \nFor those who haven't seen or don't know what Sega Moto Champ and Tomy Turnin' Turbo Dashboard look like, \ngo to YouTube.  \n\nIf there is a future update on this game, I would invest in a patch for multiplayer mode, whether it is split-screen or online.\n[list]\n[*][b]Graphics[/b] are similar to 1980's, possibly 1990's arcade racing games. It is colorful, smooth, and fast.  I guess that would be Pun for racing game, right? :) \n\n[*][b]Sound[/b] is decent, you hear the motorcycle engines. If your character's bike passes another biker on the left or side, you will it in your left or right speaker accordingly. So the sound is non-Monaural (single speaker sound). This what most were back in the 1980's. It is more advanced than Stereo sound though. Test the sound out with your 5.1 or 7.1 Sound Systems or \nHeadphones/Headsets (Dolby, DTS, DTX) and hear for yourselves...   \n\n[*][b]Music[/b], it is Pop, Techno, and Dance. It does fit the game, and it is made intensify the game as a whole.   \n\n[*][b]Gameplay[/b] is very basic, move left or right, shift up or shift down. When your Turbo Meter is Full, shift up to use it. There is a Timer, so you need to cross the finish line before it runs out. \n\n[*][b]Replayability[/b] may be short to most. \n\n[*][b]Conclusion:[/b] Arcade games were not really made to have the length and time of a RPG, Strategy, Survival, FPS, Simulations, etc. Plus, for $3 (in the U.S.), that's a cheap arcade game! If a multiplayer feature whether split-screen, online, or both. I would gladly pay $10 to $20 for it!\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1561238446,"timestamp_updated":1561238480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyJTEwOsCfMSExAE="}
