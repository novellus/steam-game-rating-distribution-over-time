Nice designs and  graphics but a bit short on story or purpose so far. The weapons are diverse and interesting with each weapon and iteration of it having different effects and looks. Mechanics/game play are fairly standard (and that's a good thing) with comfort settings to suit most players. The \"cinematic\" scenes at the start are a bit wonky as they move with your head... All in all, it looks like it's going to be a fun game.","timestamp_created":1609341853,"timestamp_updated":1609341853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41PuP2vYCcPnmvgI="}
