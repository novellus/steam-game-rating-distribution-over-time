This is essentially a single-level bullet hell shmup, but that single level mutates and iterates so many different ways that there is easily a full game worth of content. If this came out in the 90's, it's the type of thing that the old GameFan magazine would have salivated endlessly over. Hard as nails, but HIGHLY recommended. Another reviewer pointed out the Treasure influence and I have to agree. The dev has a bunch of other high-quality shooters a well and every one is well worth playing.","timestamp_created":1609459216,"timestamp_updated":1609459216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NXP3fYCcdWfvwI="}
