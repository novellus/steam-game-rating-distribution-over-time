So I decided to try to climb a building BUT it gets so dark that I can't see what I am doing.  I want to like this game.  The videos and pics look awesome but how do I get there.  No hints, help or explanation.   I have spent over an hour playing and have gotten no where.","timestamp_created":1598218940,"timestamp_updated":1598218940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5rXRjvQCcretnQI="}
