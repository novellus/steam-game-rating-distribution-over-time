I am eager to start playing it once alot more work has been accomplished on it, esp the water dispenser will not build.. the game has terrible tutorial to help you learn   the steps to take to make and fabricate the buildings you need.. also it would be nice if you can wake up more than one person to actually start accomplishing something b4 u are getting messages you are dehydrating and starving and then start dying lol, ill be checking ;back for updates, as once those issues are fixed I look forward to playing.","timestamp_created":1604806737,"timestamp_updated":1605989307,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1605042194,"developer_response":"I'm saddened to hear that you did not have a good experience with my game.  I will admit that the current version of the game may not be as self explanatory as it could be, so in response to your review I'm now going to prioritise making a tutorial to help new players.  I hope that you will then feel able to give it another chance!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4p4Kb9vUCeo2HrQI="}
