    review: "I bought this game thinking it was going to be a goofy comedy with weird\
      \ visuals.  It is this but it is also so much more.  The story is a straight\
      \ up documentary of a daughter interviewing her father and mother who were both\
      \ involved in some high level secret stuff during the Cold War.  A lot of the\
      \ game revolves around you exploring a map and discovering recordings, intel,\
      \ photographs anything that relates to the daughter, T\u2019s, life or her parents\
      \ and colleagues.  You find the intel, solve a 9 digit code and get to the next\
      \ level.  Each level takes about an hour to play.\n\n---------------\n\n[h1]\
      \ PROS [/h1]\n\n+  art.  Let\u2019s just get this out the way because it\u2019\
      s the first thing you see on the store page.  The art is bizarre.  It is all\
      \ carboard cut outs which are drawn on one side and then are just natural on\
      \ the back.  You scrunch up into a little ball and roll around like Sonic the\
      \ Hedgehog (but the controls are not good, see CONS).\n\n+  immersive.  For\
      \ a game that looks the way it does, it sure does make a good point of keeping\
      \ you deeply involved in the story by giving you lots of real life recordings,\
      \ videos, documents, photographs, snippets of daily life.  \n\n+  its not just\
      \ about the Cold War.  There is a level of storytelling that moves away from\
      \ the parents and their roles as intelligence agents.  The story inverts and\
      \ takes a look at T\u2019s secrets, her pains, her quite frankly weird life.\
      \  It must have been so strange as a kid and teenager to never really \u201C\
      know\u201D your parents.  In the videos and recordings they are masters of deflecting\
      \ questions and changing the subject.  It would have been a very frustrating\
      \ upbringing for me and I could feel that although T loves her family with all\
      \ her heart she has been so calm and patient with them, waiting for this day.\n\
      \n+  quirks ahoy!  There are so many little powerups and things you will find\
      \ along the way that keep the game fresh and interesting.  I don\u2019t really\
      \ want to say what they are because that will ruin the experience I think. \
      \ \n\n+  unique.  I haven\u2019t really seen or played anything like this before.\
      \  \n\n+  puzzles.  There are puzzles but they weren\u2019t overly hard.  There\
      \ were only a couple where I had to rethink what I was doing.  The game is fairly\
      \ self explanatory.\n\n___________________\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n-\t Movement.\
      \  Oh my my.  The movement is just terrible.  I admit I did get used to it and\
      \ I was much more adept towards the end.  There was a lot of cursing going on\
      \ before that though as this really bad, mouse only, controlling drove me up\
      \ the wall.  I think it might be because this released on PC and mobile and\
      \ it is more suited to a touchscreen control.  \n\n-\tIts all about the tudse\
      \ bridges yo.  (I have no idea if my take on Danish slang even works.  Let me\
      \ know below).  It is a short game and could probably be completed a bit faster\
      \ than I did my playthrough.  So you might want to pick this up on a sale. \
      \ \n\n___________________\n  \nI want more of this.  And I am sure I\u2019m\
      \ not alone.   I have always said that games are an excellent medium for documentaries.\
      \  We have games like That Dragon, Cancer and Kursk.  We have excellent fictional\
      \ narratives like Edith Finch, why not do the same with true stories?  We also\
      \ of course have excellent directors\u2019 commentaries in tons of our favourite\
      \ games.  Devolver gave us a gamescon right  here on Steam to play during the\
      \ COVID-19 lockdown.  There is a wealth of potential here and I am definitely\
      \ dying to see some more high quality playable documentaries.\n\nIf you are\
      \ looking to expand your Steam library with some more diverse games, then Cosmic\
      \ Top Secret is unlike anything you have ever seen before.\n"
