As an added bonus, you also get the Sport pose set, at the same price with Kids Dressy. Note that while not specified, both packs will get you access to \"Kid\"'s version of some accessories (Table / chair), as well as additional hand gestures (+5 I think).","timestamp_created":1466843826,"timestamp_updated":1469360830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595959603786468506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw496ujtYCdqDdWg=="}
