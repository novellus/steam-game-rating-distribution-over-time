After playing it some more, I can see now why this game went free to play. It's just not very good. It's bland and repetitive. I've been saying that about quite a few VR games recently, but this game is the epitome of that.\n\nIf this was still a paid game, I would definitely give it a negative recommendation. However, because it is now free, I can give a neutral recommendation as there is enough here to enjoy. You can play it for 20-40 minutes, have some fun swinging around like Tarzan and get a nice workout ... until the blandness & repetitiveness finally wears thin and you uninstall it and never play it again.\n\nYou can't really ask for more for free.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1560648406,"timestamp_updated":1560648406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546385705471038818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1560857299,"developer_response":"Thanks for your honesty! I agree - the game is more suited for the \"free\" section. I admit the game is too hard to get to the non-repetitive stage as a new user, and my initial plan was to release a huge new update, making it easier for people who haven't played a lot of games like 'Climbey' or this one before, whilst adding multiplayer and all sorts of things. School and life got in the way though, and I haven't got to release the update yet.\n\nI do plan on releasing the update soon - possibly this summer - hopefully adding many more hours of fun.\n\nThanks for your review!"}],"cursor":"AoJwv5r5rusCdM6/wwE="}
