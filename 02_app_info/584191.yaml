    review: This is a racing game I can get behind. Stunning visuals and fluid gameplay!
      It took me some getting used to because the controls for my XBOX 360 controller
      don't mesh with what I'm used to in a gamepad-controlled racing game and you
      can't change the button config :\ Other than that, it's like racing Matchbox
      cars in hand-painted Warhammer 40k terrain. Breathtaking visuals in the tracks
      and the car models are fantastic!
