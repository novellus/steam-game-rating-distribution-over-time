I remember a tip on the game to ease you in by doing some trading between Sol & the system next door so to speak using the warp.  The idea is to gain as much as possible in upgrading your initial ship before doing the main quest, that is the first of the 3 Campaigns you can choose from.  This made it easier at the beginning of the game.  I even went as far as purchasing the biggest ship, a Carrier.  The trouble with the Carrier is its very slow speed.  Makes it impossible to make the destination on time, so be careful on that score as the bigger the ship the slower you get even with enhancements.  I would also like to point out, when purchasing a new ship size put all enhanced engines, weapons, shields, armour, and any other pieces into storage.  Only leave the 3 Command deck equipment on the old ship before purchasing the new ship, then transfer all stored equipment to the new ship.  If you don,t, you will loose all of your best equipment & only have level 1 equipment on your new ship.  Lastly, Always save your games to cover mistakes you forgot about or chances you took & lost everything - experience is talking here and don't forget ... enjoy yourself.  While the equipment is the same as Space Empires V the game play is on 2d space, and you only get one ship to use, whatever ship you started with or purchased.","timestamp_created":1601685629,"timestamp_updated":1601685629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hOX59fQCdb3ApQI="}
