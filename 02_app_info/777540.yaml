    review: Fun simple Megaman inspire platformer with some interesting gimmicks although
      there are a couple things that bug me such as only one boss in the ENTIRE game
      and for some unknown reason there's ice physics in an underwater level. But
      considering the cheap price and its the developers first game, I think its a
      game worth playing through :)
