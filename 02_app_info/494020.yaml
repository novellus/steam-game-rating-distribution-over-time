    review: "It's....a part of HELP: THE GAME, you're helping somebody. I can't be\
      \ too harsh on the game, given the story behind how it was made and what it\
      \ was made for.\n\nPros:\n\n-Helping a worthy cause if purchased as part of\
      \ HELP: THE GAME\n-Cute design, but not the cutest.\n-Working AI you can play\
      \ against if you have nobody to play with \n\nNot-Pros (Sort of Cons):\n\n-AI\
      \ has unlimited \"bumping\" power, never runs out of water to propel itself\
      \ with; AI has distinct advantage\n-Not much depth, very simple (Bump them into\
      \ the water by propelling yourself with a water gun, don't get bumped into the\
      \ water, 3 lives, up to 4 players, a powerup here and [kinda] there)\n-Not very\
      \ thrilling\n-NOT a game for hours (or even minutes) of entertainment\n\nSupporting\
      \ HELP: THE GAME gets you a copy of this."
