      [h1]Major Pros:[/h1]

      [list]

      [*]Endless Sudoku

      [/list]


      [b]Minor Pros:[/b]

      [list]

      [*]Three different board styles

      [*]Color palette is easy on the eyes

      [/list]


      [h1]Major Cons:[/h1]

      [list]

      [*]Sometimes there are multiple solutions

      [*]Other users have reported issues with crashes

      [/list]


      [b]Minor Cons:[/b]

      [list]

      [*]Sound effects are grating

      [*]Power-ups only explained from the main menu

      [/list]


      [h1]Recommendation[/h1]

      I enjoyed the endless puzzles of Sudoku Quest. I liked the variety of puzzles,
      helpfulness of the power-ups, and the easy viewing of the color palette. However,
      I struggled with the sound effects, remembering the power-up effects, and the
      possibility of multiple solutions to puzzles. I did not experience it myself,
      but other users have reported crashes with certain software drivers. I recommend
      Sudoku Quest to players looking for a simple endless Sudoku game that are willing
      to forgive it the multiple solutions and do a little investigation into software
      compatibility.'
