Thanks lots!\n\nFun game, Bad decisions.\n\nThis game's pace is the best, It really gets what I want out of a shooting gallery, quick fun with variety. That said, it feels like a mobile game in it's progression (3 star ratings) and in-game \"encouragement\". There is an announcer who has zero settings to turn off or on, that will constantly (just about every other target hit) tell you stuff like, \" You're AMAZING!\" \"Holy cow you are the best shooter ever!\" and so forth.\n\nThe announcer is so constant, I couldn't handle it anymore, and asked for a refund. Which is sad, for a pistol only shooter at a decent price, it's not a bad game. \n\nIf we get options to remove the announcer, I'd rebuy.","timestamp_created":1602203916,"timestamp_updated":1603049416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1602427124,"developer_response":"Hey Jump Gunnington!\n\nYou are right about the announcer and we just released (just for you!) a small update to be able to turn it off/on! \n\nTake care,\n\nDavid\n\n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJw1JzMnvUCfPjbpgI="}
