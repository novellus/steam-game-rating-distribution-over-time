    review: '(Front Mission Evolved - Wanzer Pack 2)


      Oh man two more pretty generic Wanzer designs for $4. Front Mission Evolved''s
      DLC was a pretty bad ripoff in general, and while these might or might not have
      good multiplayer stats, they''re pretty generic and unenviable design-wise and
      not nearly as hilariously required as the Rock Jack bazooka in multiplayer.'
