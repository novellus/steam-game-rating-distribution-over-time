    review: Others will have posted better reviews of the excellent mechanisms in
      the design of this game.  For my part, as a relatively newcomer to the modern
      board game scene, I'd say the game strikes the perfect balance between simple
      structure/easy access and depth of play.  Perfect for novice or expert alike.
