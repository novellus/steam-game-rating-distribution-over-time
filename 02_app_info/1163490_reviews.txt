Walking through a maze of 215 rooms that all look the same without any map.  So you are required to have graph paper and lots of free time on your hands.\nThe game is supposed to be randomly generated, but it is the same exact map layout each time you start a new game.  The placement of the informant, gramophone and guard are always in  the same locations every time you play. Even the password never changes.  It's always: \"Gramophone\". So I don't see any of the mentioned replay value. There's some issues with grammar and a random problem where a saved game loads showing full health, but in reality the player only has half-health.  But it doesn't really matter, because even if you die, you can still Load or Continue where you left off and keep playing.  There's no penalty for dying.  In fact I finished the game is one sitting.  It's very easy, simplistic, boring and repetitious. Not at all challenging as mentioned in the description.  Just monotonous.  For anyone who purchased this game and is stuck, I created a map below. You begin on the Yellow Square and end on the Brown Square.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1921232062","timestamp_created":1573148682,"timestamp_updated":1575235377,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.735340476036071777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49orW4e4CfYOp2AE="}
