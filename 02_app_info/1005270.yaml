      \ short and late to arrival, with the guard leader spared only for as long as\

    short_description: Demo package of a product in active development. Seemingly
      destroyed on failure to intercept a dark claim on the sacred integrity core,
      a mystic investigator inexplicably finds herself several worlds from home, forced
      to rely on individuals from where she finds herself to set things right.
