I love the tone, it makes my Epiphone SG sound like an acoustic guitar. The Rhythm track adds some of the texture you hear on the recording. The Bass track is fun to play and is fast paced in some parts.","timestamp_created":1535657238,"timestamp_updated":1535657238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw37uTxuUCce/SqQE="}
