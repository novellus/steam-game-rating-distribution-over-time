    review: "Oof. \n\nThis is probably one of the most terribly optimized games I\
      \ have ever played. The cut scenes are so choppy and flash so much that they\
      \ are probably a huge danger to folks who are at risk of seizure. \n\nWhen I\
      \ wasn't slogging though the painfully slow and choppy scenes, I was constantly\
      \ caught on objects from all the collision problems or slipping through the\
      \ floor and crashing the game. The audio doesn't work either. :(\n\nI feel really\
      \ bad leaving this review, but I have to be honest about this game. \n\nSorry\
      \ friends. :("
