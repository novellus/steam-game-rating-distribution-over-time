The plot is gold, but the actors deliver a stiff response that doesn't fit the gravity of what their characters portray, at least not at key moments. Great actions scenes with a sense of gritty realism I hope I'm beginning to see a trend back to. Reminescent of Heat scenes. Twists offer plot spinoff opportunities, I could see this done as a three parter. (admit it, the studio's are still in love with 3)\n\nI could also see a game offshoot. With VR around the corner, I would be excited to hear about an entire IP product for something like this, say as a hardcore ffafpsmmorpg, full loot sorta thing.","timestamp_created":1471485183,"timestamp_updated":1471485183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45256689190864563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wcDWzdYCd7ynXw=="}
