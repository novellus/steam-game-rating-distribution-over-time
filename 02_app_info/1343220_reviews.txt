I think the issue is so many individual parts in this game are fantastic but the narrative holding up the overall game just doesn't work.  The art direction is certainly great, the music is great, over all sound design is fantastic.  As far as visual novels go this is a high quality one.  However, to put it lightly the narrative doesn’t make any sense.  \n\nThe overall plot is that a secret division of the government handles monsters that are created by people that suffer from depression/anxiety and other emotional issues.  So that’s fine…but the game attempts to tell a murder mystery without seemingly any evidence, suspects, or any narrative focus.  So that’s a problem.  \n\nLook, this game has a problem with a lot of murder mystery games, the mystery can only be as good as the writer.  This game is basically not a mystery or at least not a puzzle mystery.  No clues exist that allow you to solve it.  The solution is utterly random and could have easily been anything.  The game is also strange in that it doesn’t seem to care about this murder mystery…at one point the game has a side plot about two children that might be creating monsters and harming people…which has nothing to do with the main murder mystery plot.  This “side quest” takes quite a long time and this game is way too short for “side quests.”  It feels like halfway through the creator decided to tell a different story.\n\nAfter that section you then go into the end game and it feels extremely rushed and nonsensical.  The ending itself seemed to have no connection to any decisions I made throughout the game and ended basically before I could blink.  It feels like the creator ran out of money and had to finish things up real fast. This games plot needed room to breathe and it wasn’t given any.  The ideas the narrative brought up in the last 30min needed to be stretched out over probably 30hrs…not 30mins.\n\nNormally, I would write a review going deep into spoilers and explain why exactly the plot has severe issues…but it’s just too exhausting to do for this game.  I literally could not begin to explain all the issues with the plot…it’s a mess.  It’s a shame because the characters, the character relationships/romances, the music, the art direction, the sound design…basically everything else in this visual novel is great and if the plot worked this would be a must buy.  It really just feels like this game was not finished…at all. Hopefully this developers next game has a much stronger focus on a cohesive narrative.  \n\nHonestly, I think the real issue is the setting of a secret government division hunting down monsters with a murder mystery central plot.  This game should have been a supernatural romance game with no murder mystery and the secret government agency should have been more geared toward just investigating why spirits are appearing instead of a paramilitary organization.  What this game clearly cares about are the actual characters and the emotions they feel and this narrative greatly hampers that.","timestamp_created":1605064440,"timestamp_updated":1605104541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621427595615386963","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41PPr2/UCe6TWrQI="}
