That is exactly what you'll get out of this game. Difficulty is fine, but it must be stressed that it needs to be fair which this game seems to actively avoid being. A standard run is like this: begin play until you meet a sudden unavoidable death. Play again through again until you meet that obstacle and carefully navigate around it until meeting your next unavoidable death. Repeat af nauseum. The problem with this is that there aren't any real gameplay elements to break up the tedium of rote memorisation of these hazards, which makes it not so much a game as a monotonous test of patience.","timestamp_created":1605812086,"timestamp_updated":1605812086,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz/z28PUCepysrwI="}
