    review: 'As much as I like Xin Xianying, I''m going to have to give her ticket
      a "Not Recommended". She''s a solid character who joins during The Battle of
      Chi Bi, but she gets 2 lines in Chapter 6 and then not at all until Chapter
      10. I''m very disappointed because it seems like Koei included her to meet a
      "new character quota" rather than actually put any effort into her story. (I
      call it "her story" because she is the only playable Jin character at Chapter
      6).


      UPDATE:  Completed Xin Xianying''s story. About 80% of her speaking lines are
      in Chapter 11, which is her final chapter. I find her ending especially strange
      because (historically), she and Wang Yuanji were the two women who predicted
      Zhong Hui''s betrayal of Jin, yet her story ends before Zhong Hui even becomes
      playable. Incidentally, she can be found in the Jin campaign Chapters 12 and
      13 as a friendly general, so why did they not finish her story? What was Koei
      thinking...?'
