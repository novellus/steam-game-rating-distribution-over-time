I know it's early access, but it feels like a game from the early 2000s.. the textures aren't great, there are much older games out there that do something similar in a way that are much better graphically and functionally.\n\nNot only that, but oddly enough I was just walking around the first time just to see what the map looked like and it said I killed a guest and was fired.. \n\nI'd request a refund if I knew how.. :(\n\nIf this were only $2.00 or something it might be worth checking out.. but even that is a bit steep ..  I'm not trying to be mean here, but you should know what to expect before you plop down money you could spend on dinner or something.","timestamp_created":1595016343,"timestamp_updated":1595016343,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531615912914276123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ43b2Yr/MCdqL3lQI="}
