You use the infinity stones as balls all of them manipulate table in extreme ways. E.g. the reality stone flips the table upside down (camera angle could a bit better but it's still cool). Extremely fun table and easily worth buying the entire package only because of this one table. EVERYBODY HAS TO PLAY THIS TABLE!\n[i]EDIT: MY GOD, ACQUIRING THE SPACE GEM IS FCKING IMPOSSIBLE[/i]\n\nThe Avengers table seems complicated at first, but it's actually a very easy table. However it's also one of the most boring ones. It's all just ramps. The missions are.... kinda ok. Imho, there's really not a lot to see or do on this table.\n\nWorld War Hulk table is also mostly rails, but at least the missions are interesting. It's an interestingly balanced table - a bit difficult to land the ball where you want it, but at the same time it's forgiving to mistakes. The missions can last a long while to complete. \n\nFear Itself has an interesting layout with the magnetic pathway below the flippers. Although the missions are boring, most of the time the point is to set your balls (if you have more) on this pathway circling around the table infinitely to let it generate points for you. Meanwhile you need to keep 1 ball out of that loop to get things done on the other parts of the table.\n\nAs it goes with all of the Star Wars/Marvel tables, I have but 1 complaint:  I REALLY LIKE YOU TABLE, BUT YOU TALK TOO MUCH!!!","timestamp_created":1435012060,"timestamp_updated":1489744306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529002547264099121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9cPr7doCebq5Pw=="}
