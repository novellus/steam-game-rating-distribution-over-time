    review: "Summary: A lot of \"unskippable cutscene\"-type delays and slow UI and\
      \ several smaller issues spoiled the fun for me, but if you don't mind that\
      \ stuff and like this kind of 'gravity shooter' game, you'll probably enjoy\
      \ this one. It's small, but decent.\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nI really expected to like\
      \ this game. I played the original game jam version and had a lot of fun with\
      \ that. I'm a huge cheapskate so I was still on the fence about getting this\
      \ version, but when I saw the new update with extra customization and configurable\
      \ controls and the game on sale, I decided to go for it.\n\nSadly, I had more\
      \ fun with the jam version...\n\nThe foremost problem for me is all the UI delays.\
      \ I'm trying to play the game, but it's fighting me and wasting my time every\
      \ step of the way. The UI animations are so long, it's a slog just navigating\
      \ the menu. And you can't navigate around whenever/however you want, you're\
      \ stuck in the rut it wants you to be in. If you hit the wrong button, you can't\
      \ just hit escape a couple times and be back to the main menu. Once you select\
      \ your ship, you can't pause, quit, or go back in any way...You have to wait\
      \ through the \"Mission Objective\" screen, the game to load, the transition\
      \ in, and press thrust to begin...and only THEN can you press escape to go back.\
      \ It makes no sense.\n\n\"...optimal speed for interface animation is between\
      \ 200 and 500 ms.\"\n[url=https://uxdesign.cc/the-ultimate-guide-to-proper-use-of-animation-in-ux-10bd98614fa9?gi=1e312a5f619d]\
      \ - The ultimate guide to proper use of animation in UX [/url] \nIn Vector Prospector,\
      \ switching menus takes 3+ seconds...\n\nThe in-game interlude whenever you\
      \ collect a gem is definitely the worst. Sooo long. It's like the game stops\
      \ and you have time to go to the bathroom. Sure, it's grandiose the first time,\
      \ but the 2nd, 3rd, 4th...? No fun. I'm not sure why it even pauses there. And\
      \ it's not skippable. None of the fluff in the game is skippable, from the opening\
      \ logos to the end game report. Unlock a new powerup? You'd better get the popcorn.\n\
      \nRemember browsing the internet on dial-up? It's like that.\n\nIt's a quick\
      \ roguelike, right? It should take about 1.5 seconds to get playing again after\
      \ I die.\nBack to Nuclear Throne I guess.\n\nSome other minor gripes:\n\n- I'm\
      \ not sure why the enemy turrets' detection range is so darn long. It's not\
      \ much fun to have enemies snipe at you from two screens away.\n\n- The controls\
      \ are basic. A tiny bit of acceleration when you start turning would have made\
      \ it much, much easier to aim precisely, but not slow down longer turns.\n\n\
      - Your thrust gets boosted if you're close to a wall...I can see how this could\
      \ save you if you were going too fast, but more often it means you get a sudden,\
      \ massive boost to your thrust when you are in a tight space...\n\n- Having\
      \ configurable controls is VERY welcome, but it has some minor issues. 1)The\
      \ menu is controlled with the gameplay controls, so it's easy to mess that up\
      \ (like if you want \"up\" to be \"thrust\"). In my opinion, arrow keys, enter,\
      \ and escape should -always- work (predictably) in the menus. 2)It doesn't tell\
      \ you when you're trying to use a key that's already bound, it just doesn't\
      \ respond. 3)It doesn't display a bunch of the punctuation keys (it shows nothing),\
      \ though they work just fine. Maybe something weird with the font?\n\n- Sometimes\
      \ the background gets pretty much pure black, so can be hard to tell at a glance\
      \ what's solid ground and what's open space.\n\n- I wish there was an indicator\
      \ for how many shots you have available. You have 3 ammo that regenerates, but\
      \ no way to see how many you have left at the moment.\n\n- I noticed one small\
      \ visual glitch: Sometimes the side edges of ground tiles don't get drawn, I\
      \ think when the falling blocks slide down away from them.\n\n- Only one other\
      \ bug I noticed: Sometimes your ship will run into blocks that aren't there(!).\
      \ I think it has something to do with the falling blocks. Bullets and other\
      \ falling blocks pass through the tile, but your ship and laser sight are blocked\
      \ by it. A bit frustrating when you collide with thin air and lose a bunch of\
      \ health.\n[Edit:] Yup, definitely with the falling blocks. Only the small ones\
      \ it seems. Sometimes after they fall there's an invisible tile that your ship,\
      \ your laser sight, and the energy pickups collide with.\n\n- I wish there was\
      \ some noticeable variation between runs. Even just varying the size and shape\
      \ of the map could shake things up (long & narrow? short & wide?), or a different\
      \ number of gems (shorter playthroughs might be nice), or wildly different obstacle\
      \ spawn rates. The same content, but more replayability. Or, you know, more\
      \ ships that behave differently would be cool too. :)\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nOtherwise,\
      \ the game does seem well made. Nothing amazing, but pretty decent. I am just\
      \ picky :) Other than the occasional foreground/background confusion, the graphics\
      \ are quite clear and nice. I quite like the sounds. It's a relatively small\
      \ download size, and it runs okay on my old computer.\n\nThere's not a lot of\
      \ content, but it's reasonable. You find the powerups occasionally during the\
      \ mission and they last for a matter of seconds. There's the basic ship and\
      \ two others with special abilities. The slow-mo ability is quite fun.\n\nPlaythroughs\
      \ are a bit longer than I expected. There's an achievement for winning in less\
      \ than 17.5 minutes, so that could be considered fast. I haven't -quite- gotten\
      \ that, and one run I putzed around digging for a while and took about 45 minutes.\
      \ :}\n\n(Note: I played more hours offline and unlocked everything.)"
