    review: 'Very good bonus to owning the game.

      Certain compositions are extremely chilling and help me get through the day.


      I bought it despite the negative reviews and apparently the developers are upgrading
      the thing by adding new compositions.


      Right now the in-game folder consists of 70 compositions, both in MP3 and FLAC
      formats.


      The only thing i believe could''ve been improved on is that the compositions
      should be numerized in additional info because otherwise the freakin'' iTunes
      keep putting the compositions in alphabetical order instead (because the thing
      ignores the given name of the file) which annoys me to no end and means i''ll
      have to numerize all 70 compositions manually if i want to hear the soundtrack
      they way its intended to be.


      P.S. Certain composition names are straight-up spoilers, so i recommend to not
      listen to any of the music before you''ll finish the game.'
