    review: 'A unique and memorable game, underrated IMO.


      An interesting short game composing of story screens and about 10 action screens
      where you have to perform a bunch of actions in the right order quickly to defeat
      each foe.


      I enjoyed it, and it''s one of the very few games that I may play again. I do
      like the fact that it''s very story based even if the story is short and simple..
      but also weird / alien in a good way.


      Worth a couple of dollars, easy to recommend for people who like something original.'
