I'm really sorry to hear that The Plague left such a bad impression. I'd really appreciate it if you could add some details-- specific feedback is helpful to our development team. \n\nI'm guessing that your criticism is a result of the recent announcement about The Plague. It's true, we considered going in a different direction with the game due to the negative associations with COVID-19. However, many of our players (like yourself) were really unhappy with that decision. We're going to listen to you guys. \n\nWe don't want to disappoint our players, so we're going to release The Plague in full as intended. We may still create Renaissance Kingdom Wars in the future, but it will be a completely seperate game. \n\nI really hope you'll continue playing The Plague and give us another chance. I promise that zombies are coming soon! \n\nThanks for your time, feel free to message me with any questions. "}],"cursor":"AoJ4za2a1vYCfICovgI="}
