This game feels so good when you get into a groove, and the cockpit designs help you get into that groove.\n\nWhile early on I had problems with getting swarmed by enemies during the mission over the refinery. After getting a better feel for the controls It felt good to rip apart planes and dropping bombs on targets. \n\nThe VR aspect of the game works only to build upon the feel of the game. There is a reason why some fans of Ace Combat are pushing to have VR compatibility. Being able to watch the bombs drop and turn a boat into scrap over your shoulder feels great.","timestamp_created":1610183604,"timestamp_updated":1610183604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8v6a8/YCc4fhwQI="}
