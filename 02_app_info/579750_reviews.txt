This time, instead of one track which lasts a little over a minute, we get three tracks which last LESS than a minute. For two dollars rather than one.\n\n   They do clarify, however, that \"every one who will purchase our tracks can use for commercial\". Can't wait to find the right opportunity to slot that \"free\" twenty-something second track into a project of mine, just so I feel like I got my full value from this purchase.\n\nVerdict: 1/10 (it WAS kinda nifty the way the three tracks segued so well into each other, almost like they were one track broken into three.)","timestamp_created":1498908223,"timestamp_updated":1498912273,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.682125508785247803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4psaI/9wCdYyYfg=="}
