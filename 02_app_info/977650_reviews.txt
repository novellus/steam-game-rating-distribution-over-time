Most of the game should be familiar to anyone who has played Warcraft III or similar RTS. However, the big difference is the cooperation needed between the tree separate classes: Builder, Miner and Warrior. The Builder is a more resource- and defence focused class, while the Warrior is the more classic hack-n-slash tactical overlord type. Both of these however rely on the Miner, maybe the most unique class of them all, as they have to design and defend a whole little Factorio-like setup for mining, refining and transmuting ore and other minerals. Because all 3 classes share resources, only when they all work together, communicate, help and defend eachother, will it be possible to defeat ones enemies, whether those are monsters in stronger and stronger waves in the Survival Mode, other dwarves controlled by AIs in Skirmish, or other players in the Conquest mode.\n\nSeems quite polished for an early access game, though with some flaws in the pathfinding; but the devs are really active on Discord, and the community seems pretty welcoming. The friend pass which allows you to share the game with friends who haven't bought it yet, is a nice touch as well. Very excited to see the ongoing development of these lovable dwarves!","timestamp_created":1610039001,"timestamp_updated":1610039001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+q/z7vYCfvSowQI="}
