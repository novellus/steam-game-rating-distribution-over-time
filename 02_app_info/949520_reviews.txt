I would love to explore a new space, discover new areas, but find my personal hauntings as well. Find that perfect meditation spot and bookmark it for ready use. A place to be present and centered, wherever I may be. I can only hope!\n\nSadly, I cannot recommend this title at this time by my mentioned criteria (below) and on principle. I even made sure to take the time to try it on all of my systems to see what was design and what might have been system specific issues or simply defects:\n\n** Tested on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift w/motion, WMR (Samsung Odyssey) | 1060 through 1080 GPUs\n\nPros:\n* Wonderful concept even if not fully realized, and I feel like this HAS been implemented with some caring rather than a quick wrap cash grab.\n\n* The environments are well crafted, and definitely have that \"iconic spot\" feel to them; That image in your head that embodies a special place, realized, on demand.\n\n* Ran smoothly on all of my devices, feels moderately optimized.\n\nCons:\n* Price - this is NOT marketed as an Early Access game, therefore I must judge it by what is promised in the description vs what is actually delivered. It is almost STRESSFULLY full of \"almost-there\", as if the road was paved until the concrete ran out, stamped \"DONE\" and then left those final few yards to our imaginations. I could forgive quite a bit of my experience if I had some inkling of intent for fixing things up, or if this is in fact the GA release and relegated to bug fixes.\n\n* Locomotion - Hello Teleport! When first using teleport as guided I was expecting a nice soft pulsating ball, or ethereal projection, gently gliding me to my destination on the breath of angels. What I got was, a very much no-transparency thick white (what I can only describe as) crosshair on the ground that joltingly appeared before me. It feels out of place.\n\n* Locomotion Part Deaux - One above them all. Swimming... I love underwater adventures, but What it turned out to be, for me at least, was less a swimming experience and more of a \"Drowning Simulator\"! It starts fine, . Then... things turned dark. I was having to paddle uncomfortably fast to try and even stay afloat. I was a rock, destined for the bottom of the ocean and there I landed. After spastic attempts to \"cruise\" along blipping and bobbing through the water it REALLY ended up feeling disturbingly like what drowning might feel like.. No matter how hard I paddled I couldn't keep the surface of the water, and if I took a break for even a second the physics would drop me like a cement-shoe-laden gangster seeing his last few moments on this earth. Sadly it is not in me to withdraw... so I put on my brave face, and paddled my little heart out until back to shore.\n\n* Tutorial - I am glad there is one! But unforutnately as quickly as it appeared, it is gone and you are left wanting. (same experience all 3 HMUs)\n\nSummary: Would be a promising EA title, if it were EA. Marketed and priced as a GM product, however, all I can say is Caveat Emptor \"let the buyer beware\". \n\nNote:\nI really do love their concept, and despite the sound of it, a lot of the implementation. So, I am going to eat the cost, and hope that this is a labor of love that will get the care and feeding needed to realize its potential. \n\nI see it... Only so frustratingly... out... of... grasp.","timestamp_created":1544445639,"timestamp_updated":1544445766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602225303649902344","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl4WJzOcCfNb6tAE="}
