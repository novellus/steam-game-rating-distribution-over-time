    about_the_game: Why is it called &quot;Bring Dad Home&quot;?<br>Because the game
      was inspired by my real experience.<br>It was at the beginning of 2019, a dark
      night on a high month, and my dad just participated in socializing and drank
      too much. After getting out of the car, what only I can do is helping him walking
      home.<br>I'm not strong, but dad had a huge body.<br>It was okay at first, but
      gradually became physically weak and unable to help him later. My dad fell and
      got injured. He was taken to the hospital immediately by me.<br>A few days later,
      our team participated in the 2019 Global 48-Hour Extreme Development Competition,
      and we got a question about family relationships-&quot;What does home mean to
      you?&quot;<br>So, we hit it off right away, and &quot;Bring Dad Home&quot; was
      born.<br>After 48 hours, we won the &quot;Most Popular Game Award&quot; in Guangzhou.<br>At
      the end of 2019, &quot;Bring Dad Home&quot; was selected for the Indie Prize
      finals.<br>We hope that this game will not only bring joy to everyone, but also
      remind you of some interesting memories with your loved ones.<br><br><strong>The
