      /><br><br>Battle Siege Royale provides a gaming experience that is both unique
      and memorable, offering hours of quality replay value. The concept is simple,
      build your fortress, choose your siege weapon, defend your lands and outlast
      the enemy. If you and your castle can make it to the end you will be crowned
      champion of the siege!<br><br>1) Pick from three weapon types<br>2) Pick from
      three game modes<br>3) Outlast 4-9 enemy kingdoms (based on selected game mode)<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Battle Siege Royale has combat and movement controls similar to a
      tank game with a gameplay style similar to a battle royale. You choose either
      a; ballista, trebuchet or catapult, defend your castle (the only place you can
      go to repair your damaged weapon) and destroy the 4-9 other player's siege weapons
      and castles before they can destroy yours! A shrinking map forces enemies closer
      together, till one kingdom reigns supreme! Offering a dynamic blend of offence
      as well as defense, Battle Siege Royale makes the battle royale genre a little
      more interesting.<br><br>More of the cooperative type? Opt for the team royale
      game mode, where you and a group of friends defend your kingdom and destroy
      all others. The premise is the same as the traditional battle royale mode, but
      with a handful of friends to have your back.<br><br>Want to sharpen your skills
      or play in the backwoods with no internet? Single player helps you hone in your
      aim and tactics while outwitting challenging AI.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1100880/extras/siege_engines.png?t=1608472760"
      /><br><u><strong>Ballista</strong></u><br>The fastest and most agile of all
      the siege weapons, the ballista is easy to drive, steer and aim; however, it
      is also has the smallest punch of all siege engines. Having a lighter frame
      and lighter projectile makes the ballista an easy target for the more powerful
      siege weapons. If fast repetitive blasts and close combat are your style, the
      ballista is the perfect choice.<br><br>Originally pioneered by the early Romans,
      the ballista made its way through history as a tried and true siege weapon,
      landing itself in medieval warfare throughout Europe. Due to scarcity of resources
      and the advent of newer inventions, the ballista was a less common weapon than
      the trebuchet or catapult. The design of the ballista is similar to a great
      crossbow, set upon wheels and launching a great iron bolt.<br><br><u><strong>Catapult</strong></u><br>Not
      as agile as the ballista, but not as slow as the trebuchet, the catapult is
      the tried and true siege engine of medieval warfare. The catapult has a sturdier
      frame and heavier projectile than the ballista, making it stronger against attacks
      and more devastating towards enemies. For those players that like balance, the
      catapult is for you.<br><br> Perhaps the most widely recognized siege weapon
      of all time, the catapult was actually pioneered earlier than the ballista by
      the Greeks. Countless variations made their way to the battle field throughout
      history, but the basic design remained the same. A bucket tied under tension
      would be pulled back with a large stone and released to launch the stone great
      distances.<br><br><u><strong>Trebuchet </strong></u><br>The undisputed king
      of the siege engines, the trebuchet launches the most powerful projectiles (with
      the largest impact radius) and boasts the strongest frame. All of this power
      comes at a cost; however, with the trebuchet being painfully slow and awkward
      to steer. If over-powered raw muscle is your style, the trebuchet is the key
      to your victory.<br><br> The largest and perhaps most powerful siege weapon
      was the trebuchet (although much less mobile). Perhaps originally created by
      the Chinese as the early mangonel, a manually powered type of trebuchet, the
      larger and more powerful trebuchet is debated as to its origins. Some speculate
      the Norman English created the first, while others speculate the Franks. Nevertheless,
      this powerful siege engine wreaks havoc anywhere it goes. The weapon has a long
      arm attached to a heavy counter weight and held by a release rope or hook. When
      the arm is released the counterweight thrusts the arm forward launching even
      the heaviest of projectiles.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1100880/extras/castles.png?t=1608472760"
      /><br>Castles are a key mechanic in battle siege royale and they contribute
      greatly to the game's very strategic gameplay. <br><br>Your castle is where
      you spawn on the map and while inside it you slowly regain health. <br><br>You
      can either hold your castle and wait for the enemies to attack or you can choose
      to go on the offensive to try however you will then be leaving your castle open
      to attacks. <br><br>Once your castle has been sieged that area of the map will
      be cut off and any players that choose to stay will start to quickly lose HP.<br><br>One
      of our favourite features for the castles is that they will be destructible
      so you can have the satisfaction of sieging them to dust.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1100880/extras/maps.png?t=1608472760"
      /><br>Our goal is to provide at least 5 maps in the game by December's early
      access release.<br><br>Each map will be based off a real life location like
      the Scottish Highlands, The White Cliffs of Dover, Iceland, Wessex, Norway and
      more! Travel to medieval England as a Viking and bring down the walls of Mercia,
      or cross the channel to Normandy and extract payback as a Saxon lord. You will
      be able to choose your patron kingdom and desired location of siege in both
      multiplayer or the single player campaign mode.<br><br>We currently have a complete
      demo map, but we are excited to polish our game mechanics and then move all
      of our resources into providing unique and historical locations for your seiging
      desires! Our goal is to provide at least four additional maps for early access
      in December.<br><br>We currently have a complete demo map, but we are excited
