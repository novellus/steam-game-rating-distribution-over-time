    review: 'This game impressed me more and more as it went on. There was a minor
      graphics glitch for me in one scene early on, which worried me, and I wasn''t
      sold on the style at first; however, the glitch didn''t affect the game at all,
      and the art, puzzles, and HO scenes turned out to be excellent. This second
      entry in the League of Light series has a distinctly Halloween-y feel, with
      witches, scarecrows, and a full moon rising.


      Pros:

      - excellent art

      - nice variety of puzzles and HO scenes

      - customizable difficulty settings

      - fully interactive map

      - better-than-usual story

      - good bonus chapter

      - second, small-but-enjoyable bonus chapter that fully rounds out the plot


      Cons:

      - I had an issue where my screen would flicker (like a refresh) in one particular
      area early in the game; it wasn''t wholly resolved by using Windows compatibility
      mode (for Windows 8, in my case), but it didn''t affect the game, and didn''t
      show up anywhere else

      - no Steam achievements or trading cards (but the in-game achievements were
      interesting)


      [b]Overall:[/b]  Highly recommended.  Most of the puzzles are easy/medium, but
      there are a few challenges. In the end, I found this game more immersive than
      many HOPA games.  I would wait for a sale or at least buy in the bundle, but
      that''s not a reflection on the quality of the game.'
