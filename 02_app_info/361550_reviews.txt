The game takes place in the distant future, where technology has vastly improved to the point of people being able to be immortal through the transfer between their normal bodies to artificial ones. The transfer itself is mandatory, as there is a global virus that infects and kills people and the artificial bodies are only a temporary solution. You wake up in some unknown yurt, completely oblivious to your surroundings, and basically try to find out how you ended up in the yurt and who you are. In your journey in uncovering your memories of your past, you find a young robotic woman that has been turned into a flower vase on your table, however her memories are as clouded as yours are. She is your only company in the deserted steppe and tries to unravel her own past alongside yours.\n\nI am fairly impressed with how the game plays out, but at the same time some things are unclear. The game offers rich, glorious graphics with the ability to explore a vast deserted boundless steppe with a distant amusement part-like building in the background clouded with mystery. This allows for spectacular screenshots and artworks to be made and you really get the feeling of freedom as fresh air hits your face and the sunshine bounces off of you. There are quite a lot of easter eggs found in this steppe, like random documents that uncover the story, the random machine found in the trees and the other quest missions like your grandpas grave and your hidden cache of toys. The amusement park is also very nicely made,a really big dome featuring a bunch of flowerbeds in front of the gate with beautiful different colored flowers. The inside of this park is empty with several pavilions that you must get to in order to progress the story, and a couple of wandering black mists that add much mystery to this dome. The story of the game is pretty decent, featuring the buildup relationship of two strangers unraveling the mystery of their past and the mysterious building behind the yurt. As the story progresses, the game does a nice job of making the player actually interested in the story by adding more mysteries to unravel such as the message left behind from the protagonists grandfather and more. \n\nHowever, I do have to address some issues. While the game has very beautiful graphics, my PC was struggling to have a decent frame rate even though my PC's specs are way beyond the recommended specs. There seems to be optimization issues with the game, as facing the dome actually decreases your frames but looking away from it increases it. While I was trying to do the first quest, you will be required to pick up some items in order to complete the quest, however the items deform into a weird in-distinctive shape that doesn't at all look like the items that they should be. It's also worse when it happens to important quest items, such as the eagle's vest, it has important numbers on it but because of the glitch you cannot see the numbers. The story, while being great and worthwhile for its short duration, doesn't make a lot of sense. The game's approach to the story is mystery and I completely understand that, but after reading a lot of documents I still cannot get many questions answered. The game also doesn't explain how the transfer is at all possible, leaving even more questions. It is a little too hard to unravel, even if you read all the documents.\n\nBut, hey. The game is really good, it has a decent story, decent screenshot and artwork tools you can try out, and you should play it. It's one of a kind.\nRATING 8/10","timestamp_created":1609889072,"timestamp_updated":1609889252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqpC46vYCdObswAI="}
