    about_the_game: '<strong>Doubles Hard</strong> is a game inspired by a legendary
      production <strong>Boulder Dash</strong>, created by Peter Liepa and released
      by First Star Software in 1984. Unlike the original <strong>Doubles Hard</strong>
      game, diamonds are collected on a three-dimensional board. The player can move
      up, down, left, right, in and out. There is also ''grab'' move. The use of the
      three-dimensional board has made it possible to design completely new levels
      that put the game on an even higher complexity level.<br><br>The two-dimensional
      version of <strong>Boulder Dash</strong> has been implemented in a huge number
