    about_the_game: This is the Environmental Station Alpha Soundtrack (titled &quot;Music
      For An Imaginary Soundchip&quot;). This soundtrack has all the tracks as <strong>high
      quality LAME-encoded V0 MP3</strong>. This is not a mere sound dump of the in-game
      audio files, but a properly enhanced and mastered soundtrack album for maximized
      aural enjoyment. See the track listing below.<br><br>01.  2:54 - Wistful Departure<br>02.  3:14
      - Valiant<br>03.  1:52 - Ammoinen<br>04.  2:03 - Onwards<br>05.  3:00 - Sinking
      Feeling<br>06.  2:22 - Submerged<br>07.  3:28 - Spinning Dandelion<br>08.  3:23

      Mecha<br>14.  1:51 - The Green Room<br>15.  3:23 - Isolator (Final Departure)<br><br>(approx.
      36:36 total)<br><br>Gone are the at times sketchy loops necessary for the in-game
      soundtrack, instead replaced by proper closures. This combined with some slight
      re-structuring means there is several minutes of new material available on this
      OST release!<br><br>Two noteworthy mentions are the tracks 10 and 15. &quot;Stranger
      Danger&quot; is a bonus track of sorts. It was originally meant to be one of
      the in-game area themes, but was at the end swapped out for sake of consistency
      and perceived lack of quality. It is included on this release for the sake of
      curiosity nevertheless. The closing track of the album is a reworked version
      of the very original 2012 trailer song. This version is also heard at the end
      of the game, or well, the first minute of it anyway. For now only available
      in the full glory on this very release!<br><br>While not a direct emulation,
      the soundtrack as a whole was originally conceived as a love-letter for the
      FM and Wavetable based sound chips of the past, which is what the title of this
      soundtrack reflects. Though sonically enhanced, the music still retains it's
      intended digital-analog grittiness as present in the game as well. All of the
      minute changes made add up to as enjoyable as possible listening experience.

    review: 'Would be nice if this can be changed from  a "DLC" to a "Soundtrack"
      on Steam so it can be installed even when the game itself isn''t.


      Very good soundtrack overall.'
