But you have \"science\" points (you gain 1 every level, and you can buy more with money) which allow you to increase bonuses (more money crates, more rocket boost, and so on), or decrease others (less drag, less obstacles and so on). You also have several items which can be bought (helmet, rocket, wings, ...) to help you go farther.\n\nThere are only 2 problems with this game :\n- the progression is much too slow, whether in experience points or in money. Currently, after 17 hours, I'm barely above level 70 (the \"endgame\" being level 100, it seems, but you'll probably have to keep playing beyond that if you want to have all high level items), and I can't even buy all items for this level. And the more you advance, the longer your flights will be, making it even slower.\n- I don't like the fact that the camera will get to the side the higher you fly. In such cases, you don't see ahead, making any kind of \"strategy\" (using wings to avoid birds) completely impossible.\n\nOther than that, good fun overall, no bugs as far as I can tell, recommended.","timestamp_created":1603013045,"timestamp_updated":1605563354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuZHC6fUCfJbMqAI="}
