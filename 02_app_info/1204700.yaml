    about_the_game: "Pangea Survival is an open-world dinosaur-centric game that features\
      \ both dinosaurs and human hunters on a series of large artificial islands.<br\
      \ />\r\nOn these islands, dinosaurs are faced with the tasks of competing against\
      \ rival species for food, water, and territory. Humans in Pangea Survival are\
      \ mercenaries; collecting and hunting dinosaurs provides rewards which can be\
      \ used to purchase more ammo, supplies, food, and better equipment.<br />\r\n\
      The islands currently have over 30 species of dinosaurs present, along side\
      \ crocodiles, monitor lizards, and fish.<br />\r\nThe biomes present on the\
      \ islands are diverse: Redwood Forests, Pine Forest, Desert Dunes, Red Deserts,\
      \ Coastal regions, Tropical Jungles, and Grasslands to name a few.<br />\r\n\
      Hidden away in remote regions, are relics of human bases, these have questionable\
      \ operative stability for communication, but may possess viable resources."
