Its gameplay is different than your typical \"call of duty\" or \"fortnite\". The main character, car has a very great character arc. The character, or should i say caracter desgn is very fantastic. Sometimes when I look at these cars Its like real life. The game is extremely immersive with amazing sound effects, graphics, gameplay, physics and music. The polish indie rock in the backgound at all times really makes the game much better. The best part of the game is the gameplay of course. Its not an innovative racer, instead it perfects what has come before. The car handling is amazing, though I suggest rebind some controls because they are a bit weird (a product of its time. This game was made 9 years ago and still holds up. 10/10.","timestamp_created":1601904959,"timestamp_updated":1601905101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jIG//PQCc9eDpgI="}
