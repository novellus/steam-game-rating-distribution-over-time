No easy pause mechanism. No speed control. You have to reset switches for trains coming the other way. Impossible to make some switch changes in the split seconds some combinations require. Stop lights are timed from when you activate them instead of when the train arrives so you have to time it at that right moment. Just a mess of madness. Maybe you should play it in a speed limiter maybe.","timestamp_created":1526445039,"timestamp_updated":1526445039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557195544242858887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42dvNs+MCede5oAE="}
