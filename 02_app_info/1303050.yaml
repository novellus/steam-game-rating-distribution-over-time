      /><br><br>First game from the Sword'n'Wands studio, Ruggnar is a platformer
      set in dark places, full of traps with no other equipment than a stock of candles.<br>His
      mining city is in decline. Listening to rumors while draining his pint in a
      tavern, Ruggnar leaves to explore abandoned places to make a fortune. But it
      is without expecting the many traps protecting these treasures.<br><br>Ruggnar
      also stumbled upon an ever-changing castle. He swears that every time he approaches
      it, the castle changes, having different amounts of treasures and different
      placements of hazards.<br>That sounds very much like a random mode!<br><br><img
