    review: 'Wow managed to get killed faster than in the first book. And not even
      from a choice I made!


      Sad to think I wasted money on these two, wish the other book that was supposed
      to have been released yesterday had been released on time.


      Bottom line unless you like dying and trying to figure out why so as to avoid
      it again maybe on your next play through (Im sure only to be killed by something
      else) Id suggest a hard pass on this series.'
