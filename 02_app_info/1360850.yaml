    about_the_game: "Isles of Yore is a multiplayer simulator that aims to make you\
      \ experience what it was like to go through life as a prehistoric animal.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Survival</h2>Claim your domain with an animal of your choosing\
      \ in an environment that best suits your needs\u2014dense jungle, treacherous\
      \ swamps, and the wide open areas of the island all offer unique advantages\
      \ and challenges. Compete with other players and AI in a bid for supremacy and\
      \ survival in the food chain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>Gameplay centers around\
      \ raising and taking care of the animal you've chosen. Balancing your thirst,\
      \ hunger, and stamina are vital day-to-day concerns as you explore the rich\
      \ environment around you alone or in a pack of friends. The initial batch of\
      \ animals selectable for play centers around small to medium sized theropod\
      \ dinosaurs like Coelophysis, with a plethora of AI driven characters stalking\
      \ the land around you. Future updates flesh out this roster further, with larger\
      \ animals and aquatic biomes planned and in the works.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A\
      \ labour of love</h2>Isles of Yore is a passion project started from a place\
      \ of admiration for the awe-inspiring history of life on our planet. The path\
      \ forged by games in the survival genre offers a uniquely visceral, tantalising\
      \ glimpse into this strange and wondrous past, and the project intends to build\
      \ on this formula with special care to highlight the uniqueness of the animals\
      \ that came before us.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>Your feedback is most welcome\
