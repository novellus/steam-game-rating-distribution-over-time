    review: 'Funny story: I actually got in contact with the lead guitarist of Megasapien
      on Myspace back in when  actually upkept a profile. He had a sense of humour
      and I bugged him about tableture for one of the songs on the game. I said that
      I actually liked the sounndtrack but that the game was a bit... yea. He agreed.


      This game is rubbish. I played it as long as I could but in the end the only
      positive about it is that they included music that the  devs didn''t produce.'
