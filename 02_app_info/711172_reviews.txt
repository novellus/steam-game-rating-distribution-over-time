No way to lower the difficulty either...\nSadly a fail on the Dev team, at the very least let the ones who cry for bloodborne difficulty games tick the \"hellish\" box and have at it, don't ruin it for the others who playing defensive, are more casual, or enjoy the base building aspect of the game.","timestamp_created":1609653516,"timestamp_updated":1609653516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7u604/YCc+78vwI="}
