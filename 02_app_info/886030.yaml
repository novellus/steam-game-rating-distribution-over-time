      /><br><br>Orphan Age is a dystopian life sim game where you play not as the
      soldiers of war, but as the children left behind. Set against the backdrop of
      an unforgiving, neon-lit dystopian warzone, your only battle is the fight for
      survival, scraping out a living in the face of extreme danger as war engulfs
      the world around you.<br><br>You will guide a band of orphans, each with their
      own skills, emotions, strengths, weaknesses and fears, through a dangerous and
      ever-changing city in a bitter struggle for survival. Constantly balancing risk
      and reward, you must make the big decisions to ensure the group stays alive.
      Build up your base, scavenge, craft and venture out into the city for new recruits,
      whilst ensuring there are enough supplies to keep going, even when it seems
      all hope might be lost.
