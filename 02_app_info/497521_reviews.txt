That and some odd bits like the 2 doors that are present don't quite cover the door frames in the game very well but you can resize those without any trouble. I also noticed that the textures for the walls had no real options for a home that would have been well cared for and had clean walls (I used what would have been white walls but it was covered in dirt).\n\nMy complains are super minor though and I love this DLC for all that it adds to home building for my games! :D","timestamp_created":1475603141,"timestamp_updated":1475603141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59516298770904541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mKKzyNcCdunRYg=="}
