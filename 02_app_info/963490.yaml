    about_the_game: <i>Abyss Manager</i> is a dungeon management simulation game.
      You will play as a new manager of a small dungeon. Make it a formidable abyss.<br><br>You'll
      start with almost nothing, recruit minions, accumulate money, construct facilities,
      develop technology, explore the realm, have the dungeon's name up, defeat other
      dungeons and win the championship of the Dungeon League.<br><br>There're more
      than 350 traits, over 300 skills and 60 races. Making randomly generated characters
      unique, you need to arrange your minions properly to deal with invaders that
      are also unique. Manage the rotation and training, deploy personnel to expedition
      and operate facilities, and participate in league matches held between dungeons.<br><br>You
      don't need to control every detail of the battles. Minions will fight independently
      according to their personalities and tactics. You can also manage the battle
      directly, which cost your actions so better make your precious decision count.
      <br>Minions won't die in battles, but if you can't pay them, they will leave
      you one by one. Choose between cheap mobs or expensive elites, it's up to your
      insight.
