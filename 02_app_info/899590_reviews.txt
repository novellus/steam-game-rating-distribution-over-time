Not a pure horror game though. There are some platforming sections, some puzzle sections and sections where you have to avoid traps. So the game has a pretty good variation. It is also quite long with a playtime of about 4 hours for such a game and for that price. Graphics are ok, framerate is good and the gameplay is usually quite fun.\nWhat I didn't like: the game feels stretched at some points, especially at one point where you think that the end of the game is near but you only got half of the game at that point. Some other levels also feel like they should have been way shorter.\nThen the story: I basically have no clue what it was about, way too confusing and fragmented.\nAnd lastly some of the enemies suck.\n\nStill overall a good game which I do recommend. But don't expect anything great.","timestamp_created":1609780874,"timestamp_updated":1609780874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519867539405822754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsdma5/YCecu5wAI="}
