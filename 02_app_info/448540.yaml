      \ class=\"bb_tag\">THE GAME</h2><br>You have just awoken in an abandoned laboratory.\
      \ Who you are, how you got here, and why are you here all seem to be a mystery\
      \ to you. Yet there is a more pressing matter at hand, is that it is obvious\
      \ you are not alone. <br>If you want to survive this encounter, and perhaps\
      \ get out of this place, you must quickly adapt. Your priority in this battle\
      \ is to keep the facility operational. To do this you'll need to use whatever\
      \ you can find, be it a flashlight to illuminate the way or concussion grenade\
      \ scare off any unsavory entities. Despite these grim circumstances there are\
      \ still clues which may aid your memory, and there is a slight chance you may\
      \ escape alive. <br>Enough talk, time is running out! Your fate is in your own\
      \ hands and it's now a battle of will!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TIPS</h2><br>GENERATORS<br>These\
      \ generators seem to have been abandoned years ago, luckily they still seem\
      \ to run. If you want to survive your priority should be to keep them running.\
      \ Don't get too comfortable though, there's no saying which generator will fail\
      \ next. <br><br>FLASH LIGHT ( Right-Click )\_<br>Use your flashlight conservatively,\
      \ although it recharges there's no telling what will go bump in the night.<br><br>FLASH\
      \ BANG ( Left-Click )\_<br>Although there are no ballistic or blunt weapons\
      \ laying around the facility there seem to be a few scattered concussion flash\
      \ bang grenades scattered about. Perhaps these will slow down any pursuers.\
      \  <br><br>OXYGEN\_<br>Sealed off from civilization it seems the facility can\
      \ only last so long with it's current oxygen levels. Any movements you take\
      \ will deplete your supply so make your moves wisely.\_<br><br>DOCTOR\_<br>This\
      \ humanoid silently lurks through the halls looking for victims. A flash bang\
      \ may stun him monumentally but it will in no way stop him.\_<br><br>MONKEY\_\
      <br>With seemingly random and spontaneous movements this feral beast will hunt\
      \ you down. If you want to survive you'll need to use the movement detector\
      \ to prepare your counter-attack, but in order for this to work the room must\
      \ be silent.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STYLE</h2><br>Terror Lab is simple-to-play\
      \ independent horror game where players can quickly familiarize controls and\
      \ jump right into the action. Taking inspiration from games such as 'FNAF',\
      \ 'Boogeyman' or 'Emily want to Play' Terror Lab aims to create an ominous and\
      \ terrifying setting for players of all skill level to endure."

    review: No story (as far as I can tell), generic jumpscare-y monsters and a bunch
      of running around and doing 'tasks' for some reason. It got boring immediately,
      after a couple minutes.
