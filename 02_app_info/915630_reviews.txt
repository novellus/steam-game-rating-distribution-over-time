But no, still the same and it would seem that no effort is being expended to remedy the problem. However, the autopilot is fully functional using the fsx keyboard commands for altitude select and Altitude lock which can be configured to an unused key on the joystick. Not ideal but gets the system working. Vertical speed and FLC then works with the UP/DOWN wheel. Once this is sorted you can then appreciate how good this aircraft is. I would highly recommend this DLC but only purchase when on sale due to the above fudge which is clearly never going to be fixed..","timestamp_created":1609605252,"timestamp_updated":1609605252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuuD84fYCdLDjvwI="}
