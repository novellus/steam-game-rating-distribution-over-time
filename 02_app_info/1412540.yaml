    about_the_game: "Zball IV is the return of physics puzzles series. Now there are\
      \ portals that instantly move objects to another location. When moving, the\
      \ speed of the object is saved, so you should be careful when moving. The rest\
      \ of the game rules remain the same.<br><br>You can use 2 types of objects to\
      \ change the direction of gravity. The 1st one is a button - just press it to\
      \ change the direction of gravity. The 2nd one is an activated object that change\
      \ gravity when it collides with a green ball.<br><br>Blocks can have different\
      \ powers - some can be destroyed when colliding with other objects or from an\
      \ explosion, some are monolithic but mobile, some can mve the green ball. Most\
      \ often, there is no specific algorithm of actions, you should rely only on\
      \ your intuition to solve the problem. Platforms interact with objects in different\
      \ ways. For example, there are platforms that make round objects roll in a certain\
      \ direction. There are transparent platforms that are divided into colors and\
      \ can only interact with objects of their own color.<br><br>There are game levels\
      \ of different difficulty and types. Some levels require dexterity and reaction,\
      \ some will require patience and caution, others will make you think about the\
      \ sequence of actions. You can see how to interact with an object by its color.\
      \ For example, green is the main color, and you need to deliver it to the platform\
      \ of the corresponding color. Yellow object reacts to explosions from mouse\
      \ clicks. Blue objects are destroyed when they collide with yellow ones. Blue\
      \ ones are not destructible, but they can be moved by yellow objects. Red objects\
      \ break down from the explosion\u2026 Gradually you will understand how the\
      \ system works and will be able to cope with any task! Exciting gameplay will\
