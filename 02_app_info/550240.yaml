    review: 'This is a game where you play as your spirit, soul, what have you, you
      are dead but you weren''t supposed to die yet so you have to go back and discover
      and listen to your memories. Yea.


      The game has terrible voice acting which left me unmoved in any manner, left
      me unconvinced emotionally, so I couldn''t really attach myself to the story,
      which is what this game is supposed to do. It''s mostly about story, and it
      is presented in a walking simulator format.


      The graphics are terrible which is a huge negative, it is a walking simulator,
      one of the things you have to nail is a world that is pretty to look at.


      The soundtrack is in the same realm as most other walking simulator type games,
      not bad, not great, just... the norm.


      I played it for 20 minutes before I quit so I can''t go super in-depth about
      the entire game.


      In short it is an ugly walking simulator with bad voice acting that is unable
      to convince you.


      I don''t recommend this to anyone, but I wish the developer good luck in their
      future games, this seems like their first game.

      I hope they take more time on the next one and are more self-critical next time.
