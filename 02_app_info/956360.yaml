      /><br>One fine morning, Ral, Mindy, AJ, and Jing go to play badminton when an
      evil being appears and kidnaps Mindy. Things seem pretty grim until a mysterious,
      old man named Lao Pi materializes and offers Ral an enchanted badminton racquet.
      He explains that the racquet can deflect any attack back at an enemy but cannot
      do direct damage by itself. Determined to rescue his friend, Ral embarks on
      a journey which will take him from the clouds in the sky to the depths of Hades.   <br><br>Navigate
      through intense, heart pounding traps and obstacles. Discover new and interesting
      ways to defeat your enemies. Meet a crazy cast of characters including a hockey
      player who thinks he is a god, a lacrosse player running an insane asylum, and
      a basketball player who turns his trophy into an actual wife.  Experience a
      storyline that pokes fun of sports figures, video games, and pop culture in
      general. Most importantly, become the greatest warrior of all time... a badminton

    developer_response: So version 2.0 is now out that addresses a lot of the issues
      mentioned. Now almost every single enemy has an animation indicating when they
      are going to attack. In addition to that, animations to the bosses have been
      added to differentiate their different attacks. Some of the boss movements have
      also been slowed down to lighten the difficulty. More improvements are coming
      with the Chinese New Year edition that will be releasing in February including
      a redo of the clocktower theme that doesn't include the part that sounds like
      the Cutman theme from Mega Man. I think while composing the music, I listened
      to so many 8-bit tunes I accidentally made some of mine sound too similar. Well,
      hope everyone enjoys the changes.

    review: "TL:DR Up and coming platformer that will hopefully continue to be improved\
      \ up to release. Consider getting it on sale.\n(Version: 2.0 Chinese New Year)\n\
      \nAfter the newest update for Badminton warrior came out, I had to give it another\
      \ try to check out the update. This review includes things that have not changed\
      \ as well as my impressions on the changes to the game.\n\nMy brother found\
      \ this game around Christmas and we downloaded the demo. We were very entertained\
      \ by the idea of a platformer that revolved around badminton, and that\u2019\
      s what drove me to buy the full game. The game is has clear inspirations from\
      \ Mega Man, my favorite series, so I enjoyed the platforming challenge.\n\n\
      The racquet is a unique idea for a platformer. Swinging the racquet is fun but\
      \ there is a bit of a delay which makes you have to predict when you need to\
      \ attack. Relying on enemy attacks means you must often wait for the enemy to\
      \ attack again before you can kill it. One reason that this mechanic is so great\
      \ is because it feels like you are outsmarting a boss or enemy and using its\
      \ own attack against it. It\u2019s satisfying to set up a spike on an enemy.\
      \ The vertical space required to do a lot of advanced techniques means that\
      \ some enemies can be jumped over and avoided entirely. The character controls\
      \ well but feels just a little floaty in mid-air.\n\nThe game\u2019s art is\
      \ alright but doesn\u2019t always have focus. Some of the bosses (for example\
      \ football, basketball, hunting, and Gorgus who after the update is still the\
      \ best character) clearly go for a good cartoony art style while other bosses\
      \ and enemies look less clean. The level art is pretty minimalistic and usually\
      \ makes sense for the stage, but while the fortress stages have some really\
      \ good atmospheric backgrounds, other stages are boring or don't match the art\
      \ style.\n\nThe music has an 8-bit style, but a lot of it is pretty forgettable.\
      \ The exception to this is the boss themes, which really drive the boss fights.\
      \ The sound effects in the game were very well implemented.\n\nThe levels themselves\
      \ present a lot of fun and unique challenges, but many require a good amount\
      \ of trial and error, so the creator mercifully gave us infinite lives. There\
      \ were a fair number of checkpoints in the game, but it would have been much\
      \ too difficult to complete multiple challenges in a row without them. Because\
      \ the character can only reflect attacks, it is extremely important that enemies\
      \ make it clear when they will attack. The game really gets into stride during\
      \ the fortress stages. The old gimmicks come back being used in ways that weren\u2019\
      t shown off in the early levels, and some of the most fun gimmicks in the game\
      \ show up.\n\nThe bosses seemed to take up most of the game\u2019s playtime\
      \ in my first playthrough. There were bosses that at first, I believed had not\
      \ pattern but after a long time I was able to dodge their attacks much more\
      \ easily. Some of the bosses were greatly improved in the update, so I was less\
      \ likely to blame the game on dying. Knowing the patterns made my second playthrough\
      \ much quicker than the first. On the other hand, some I never stopped having\
      \ trouble on. Even on my second playthrough, the lacrosse boss is still a pain\
      \ to fight. Again, thank goodness for infinite lives.\n\nUnlike my first playthrough,\
      \ I can proudly say that I beat the game this time. The fortress bosses were\
      \ greatly improved [spoiler] and the coolest one was still two Gorguses, double\
      \ the Gorgus, double the fun.[/spoiler]  Just like the stage bosses, the final\
      \ fortress bosses have a difficult pattern that can be learned and exploited\
      \ to get that sweet, sweet final victory. [spoiler] I can\u2019t wait for the\
      \ game to have a proper ending.[/spoiler] \n\nAt this point in Early access,\
      \ it feels safe to say that the game has improved since December and will hopefully\
      \ continue to improve until its release. Still has a ways to go to be worth\
      \ its 10 dollar tag. Anyone looking for a fun, nostalgic, or just \u201Cout\
      \ there\u201D platforming experience and has some money to burn should check\
      \ this game out."
