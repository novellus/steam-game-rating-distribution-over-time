The title centers around the \"Omega Pattern\" which is a brain signal that gives the person born with it psychic abilities. Enter Shaiel, a young man who possesses the Omega Pattern and finds himself constantly on the run from a shadowy organization known as Bioagora which seeks to control anyone with these unique skills. As the protagonist, you will have the opportunity to make decisions and determine Shaiel's personality as the narrative progresses. Will you be able to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Omega Pattern and Bioagora?\n\nI found the presentation in this visual novel to be above average in the genre. The manga inspired artwork is pleasant to look at and has great color. Also, there were some interesting characters introduced throughout the story some of which I would like to know more about perhaps in future installments? However, the audio I found less inspiring and the soundtrack is not very memorable in my opinion. With that said, this V.N. puts forth some solid visuals and has a decent presentation yet try as I might I just couldn't seem to connect with the story which to me is the most important part of a visual novel.\n\nI did not enjoy my read of Omega Pattern and was also quite shocked to learn that this was only the first part as I was under the impression that this purchase was for the complete novel...guess I didn't read the \"fine print\" close enough? Nevertheless, I found the story hard to follow at times yet I did enjoy the concept of shaping the protagonist's personality through flashbacks from his past. Also, I came across quite a few typos and found some of the English version dialogue strangely worded. As far as options go, there are Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards as well as an original soundtrack available. In conclusion, the story in this first installment of Omega Pattern was not a good read for me yet I will give the next installment a try when it eventually becomes available but I would NOT RECOMMEND this visual novel to anyone fan of the genre or not.","timestamp_created":1518950747,"timestamp_updated":1518950822,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.762339115142822266","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh8ah1OECfd6mmQE="}
