The characters were super endearing and the world is beautiful and fleshed out. I normal start getting bored with doing extra exploring and just start moving through the story as quick as possible but with this game i really enjoyed slowing down and going around the world and interacting with the npcs and finding treasure chest. Also I thought the combat system was fun and different enough to be unique. I kinda tend to be a hoarder and a tank and spank kinda guy when it comes to turn based games, but in this game i felt like the strongest way to fight was also the most fun, which isn't always the case imo. Use your strong expensive abilities and use mana regen abilities and items to keep going. I do agree with the other reviews however about the story ending abruptly. It wasnt even the length of the game that was the issue, it was more like It felt like you were just really getting into the meat of the story(which i was really enjoying) and the final scene kinda feels like the scene where you were supposed to be introduced to the final boss. and be like okay this is the guy im suppose to hate for the rest of the game, but its the final confrontation. Even still for $1.50 you get a bunch of game with endearing characters, a beautiful well built world, and fun engaging combat. super worth it if you are into these types of games at all.","timestamp_created":1597083682,"timestamp_updated":1597083682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzeDm7PMCeaXTmgI="}
