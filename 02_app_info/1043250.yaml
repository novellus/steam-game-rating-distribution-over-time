      \ beginning stages. A lot of hardwork and dedication is being put into it, as\
      \ of right now it\u2019s basic functions are working. Because of the nature\
      \ of StreamPad, we have decided to release it under Steam\u2019s Early Access\
      \ program. This will allow users to use StreamPad and give any feedback on what\
      \ could potentially make the application better. With dedication, diligence\
      \ and some support, we\u2019ll be able to create an application that can keep\
      \ evolving to a point where Streamer\u2019s can use it as a reliable tool in\
      \ their streams.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Streaming Focus</h2>This application works\
      \ similar to a real soundpad or soundboard. The sounds will come out through\
      \ your desktop, which allows you to hear them and transmit them on your stream\
      \ in the spot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Masterboard</h2>If you are using a controller\
      \ to play your video game while streaming, or you are broadcasting a podcast,\
      \ you can use the MasterBoard to have access to more sound files on screen.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Create</h2>You can record and trim your own clips through\
      \ the creation tool."
