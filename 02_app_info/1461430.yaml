    review: 'Short but fun game. I love the alchemy style games, trying to figure
      out different combinations. This is the first one I''ve seen with 3 and 4 element
      combinations, not just 2. I will say there are a lot of combinations that aren''t
      particularly obvious, but there''s a robust hint system if you need it that
      will pretty much hold your hand if you get stuck. There''s a lot of potential
      for growth in this, so hopefully they do more updates to add in more elements.


      Also, "clown" :D'
