    review: It is a really beautiful game, it's cute and it confronts a difficult
      object like death quite nicely. I've been watching out for this game for some
      time, and im really happy that it turned out to be such a pretty game. The story
      is beautiful and true, the animation is really cute and great, and the music
      fits the game perfeclty. All in all, a well produced game :)
