      \ Reichsbahn were keen to get dieselisation underway, replacing steam locomotives\
      \ with a modern fleet of standardised locomotives, that between all variants\
      \ could cover any duty required on the network. Many locomotive designs started\
      \ cropping up, including the V60, V90 and V164, however none managed to fill\
      \ the 1,000 horsepower market, and so a further design was established.<br><br>Dubbed\
      \ the \u201CV100\u201D, the first of this new 1,000 hp locomotive was built\
      \ in 1966 (following the production of two prototypes) and the result was a\
      \ double-ended locomotive with the cab situated in the middle, allowing for\
      \ seamless operation in either direction. In all, over 860 of these locomotives\
      \ would be built, and they were put to use on all medium traffic throughout\
      \ East Germany.<br><br>Many locomotives were rebuilt during their lifespan in\
      \ order to excel at more specific duties, one such in particular was retrofitted\
      \ with a 1100 kW engine, and these were classified as the DR Class 114. With\
      \ the Reunification of Germany and the merger of Deutsche Reichsbahn and Deutsche\
      \ Bundesbahn, these locomotives were reclassified once again to become the DB\
      \ BR 204.<br><br>There was an additional caveat however, given the age of the\
      \ BR 204s and in some cases their redundancy amongst other traction, they were\
      \ soon limited to 80 km/h and cast off the main network, making them a fleet\
