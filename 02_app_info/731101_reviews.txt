It is easy to get frustrated during this one. The other levels were a quick, relaxing and fun play through. If you like the game and want to play it, then go ahead and purchase. I felt like I had to purchase because I liked the rest of the game so much. But I really could have just skipped this level.","timestamp_created":1608393095,"timestamp_updated":1608393095,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524793386459350586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49d7svfYCebm7uwI="}
