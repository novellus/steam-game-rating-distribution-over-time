    review: "Played this game with friends and we had a lot of fun.  The graphics\
      \ are pretty and have a storybook quality.  The controls were largely good,\
      \ although playing as Jonathan (the character with the crossbow), I noted that\
      \ there are moments in the game where I was trying to aim and having some difficulty\
      \ getting the shots to register.  The worst offender here is the dragonfly ring,\
      \ which you need to be very close to to shoot and which the mage player told\
      \ me he had limited control over using his psychic ability, which meant the\
      \ dragonfly kept wiggling.  Given that Jonathan cannot aim above his head past\
      \ a certain point, it was marginally frustrating to have to keep backing up\
      \ to try to get a lock on the dragonfly ring while the dragonfly was moving\
      \ erratically.\n\nSpeaking of the dragonfly, as mentioned, there are times Jonathan\
      \ has to grapple on to its ring and then be moved around in flight to shoot\
      \ things.  This is a fun mechanic, but it also started making me a bit motion\
      \ sick.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nAs for combat, all of the enemies are highlighted\
      \ in white when you scroll over them.  This continues even after they are dead.\
      \  Given that you have to fight clumps of enemies at a time, I found this confusing\
      \ at times and periodically caught myself shooting dead enemies.  I would prefer\
      \ it if the white highlight disappeared upon enemy death to make it clearer\
      \ which enemies are still alive given how chaotic combat against large groups\
      \ can get.\n\nJonathan's crossbow does not have any weight to it.  The sound\
      \ it makes when firing is rather soft and weak, and there is no feeling of recoil.\
      \  I often found myself wondering if my shots were landing or doing anything\
      \ outside of the few moments where he would comment on it with a voice line\
      \ such as, \"bulls eye!\"\n\nAll of the puzzles have numbered signs indicating\
      \ the order in which to solve them.  I feel this does the experience a great\
      \ disservice and deprives the players of the opportunity to solve the puzzles\
      \ themselves.  There was no problem solving required at all as we dutifully\
      \ went from sign to sign.  I strongly recommend the devs reconsider this approach\
      \ and allow players to work through puzzles together without the hand-holding.\
      \ \n\nThe subtitles (in English, anyway) had some typos and strange punctuation\
      \ in places, but I'm sure that will be ironed out before release.\n\nThe guy\
      \ playing Sersi, the bear, had a great time and had zero complaints.  It did\
      \ feel as if he and I were more useful than Almika overall, and the guy playing\
      \ Almika did stop to complain at one point that we were doing almost everything\
      \ and all he did was mind control a few snails and dragonflies.  I hope this\
      \ will be more balanced at some point.\n\nOverall, we had a great time. I look\
      \ forward to the finished release!"
