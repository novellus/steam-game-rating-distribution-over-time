    review: First of all, I thought this had something to do with training, but instead
      it is a hard core campaign where you are expected to do things without any proper
      explanation, and you cannot miss the (not clearly defined) restrictions by an
      inch. Once you fail, and you will, you get shout at with a very realistic and
      very loud military personnel. I'm not taking this as I'm trying to have fun
      while learning. Asked for refund after very brief trial of this.
