And, well, you have to teleport most of the time in every level, the jumping mechanic is only secondary.\nIn addition, there are some bugs, and the level design is perfectible. In some levels, there are \"shortcuts\", that I assume are not intended to be shortcuts, which enable you to skip most of the level. Also, some saws are poorly positioned (for instance, one right before the end of the last level), meaning that you have to perform an accurate teleportation ... which is, as I mentionned above, not easy due to the controls.\nThat is why I cannot recommend this game in the end.","timestamp_created":1603727374,"timestamp_updated":1603727374,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw67bmsvUCc7qiqgI="}
