    review: "Why should you buy this game? The true question is: Why not? This shooting\
      \ game combines fighting game inputs with shmup gameplay. It is also the game\
      \ that has so many references to other games that I can't even list them all.\
      \  Main inspirations were Hellsinker and Re:frain prism memories which I recommend\
      \ checking out aswell.\n\nThis game is different from the original CD version.\
      \ I don't want to say what got changed, but it certainly made the game far better.\
      \ One big plus is that ingame documents can now be read which wasn't possible\
      \ in the other version. \n\nthe game consists of 6 stages with 3 difficulties.\
      \ It plays after akashicforce. \n\nAdvent gives 500% shield which are 5 hits\
      \ with shield and 2 with shield-off. your shield regenerates once you use them\
      \ for grazing which allows for quick recoveries.\n\nOn Another shield gets reduced\
      \ to 100% and you die instantly without shield-on. regeneration is slowed, bullets\
      \ are faster and a bit denser.\n\nAkashic adds revenge bullets and forces a\
      \ more radiant silvergun-esque playstyle. bullet density and speed are also\
      \ enhanced. \n\nwhile it certainly takes a few hours to properly learn the system\
      \ it becomes a lot of fun later once you learn to use them in more efficient\
      \ ways. \n\nmy favourite feature of the game are the options. you can customize\
      \ your inputs aswell as change the behaviour of your shield/wing. there is also\
      \ the option to enable autocontinue and autorestart which I haven't seen in\
      \ other games yet. \n\nOne thing to note is that highscores submitted to the\
      \ leaderboards allow 1 credit clears only. Take it how you want. I don't really\
      \ mind, because it allows for more optimization during the run. \n\n\n\n"
