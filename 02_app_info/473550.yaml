    developer_response: "Hi,\n\nThank you for playing the game, we are sorry to hear\
      \ the game is not to your satisfaction.  We would like to note that the game\
      \ is in early access stage and we are open to feedback, would you be willing\
      \ to work with us to improve the game with the aim to give you a good experience?\n\
      \ \nAdditional note:,The game is currently listed as LAN multi player so that\
      \ feature can be expected. When going sown slopes the players movement is restricted\
      \ on purpose to carry on sliding down the slope.\n\nCan you provide improvement\
      \ suggestions, e.g.:\n-Improve the controls, e.g. provide sensitivity sliders?\
      \ \n-Change  slope movement?\n-Change Multi player features, over internet?\n\
      \nThanks in advance and hope to hear from you soon."

    review: '**WARNING** Do not waste your time or money!


      Only a lan game that you will need friends for in order to play...


      The slopes are glitchy and that''s 80% of the map, you get stuck....all the
      time.


      The movement is wonky and cheesy, you see the price tag, you join the game...and
      you go...yea...I get it now...'
