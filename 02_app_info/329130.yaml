    about_the_game: 'And through the Kickstarter gauntlet we have arrived. Yes, we
      have a procedurally-generated universe to explore. Yes, we have eye-gogglingly
      gorgeous vector-based gameplay coupled with particle effects so effortlessly
      effervescent that you won''t have time to wonder if &quot;effortlessly effervescent&quot;
      means anything coherent. And yes, we have noises and musical moods that take
      a warm soapy sponge to your brain and massage it into cerebral splendor. <br><br>BUT
      YOU DON''T HAVE TIME FOR THAT!!!<br><br>You''re too busy crafting the perfect
      vessel, a spaceship pristine and precise and, perhaps, powerful, agile, and
      envy-inducing. Your shapes and colors will induce both fear and wonder into
      the electronic hearts of whatever insectoid, angley, squarish, plantlike race
      of alien ships that you come across in your digital safari. <br><br>And then
      you grow. And it changes everything. Now your left wing must become your right

      that you really needed to buff up that armor. Right? Definitely.<br><br>And
      then you grow again. And again. And now you''re a battleship capable of producing
      your own fleet, and each member of your fleet can spawn it''s own fleet, and
      you need it. Your enemies are constantly changing shapes, sizes, and intensities
      as ships created and honed through the experience of a thousand battles find
      their way from their creator''s computer to yours, leaping into your universe

      \ sizes of ship and destroy others....\u201D<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/09/12/build-spaceships-reassembly/\"\
