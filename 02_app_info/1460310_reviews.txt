Should've been interesting if the AI isn't so bad and mindless that you, the player, have to guide the enemy out of your way before you can continue...\n\nThe mysterious style music and the cute look design of the game doesn't match at all, very bad combination. And there's only ONE combined music track that plays on a loop throughout the whole game.\nIf the dev at least use some cute and light spirited background music to match the look, this game might be more bearable... \n\nAnd being unable to change control mapping makes it worse... the whole game is near torture of boredom while struggling with the controls. Not recommended.","timestamp_created":1608869675,"timestamp_updated":1608869743,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609168454,"developer_response":"Hi Meowish,\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for playing  The Cat Banny!
