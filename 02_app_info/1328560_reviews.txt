And is an easy recommend to anyone who has fond memories of Arcade VS. Puzzle games. In this match three gem game, you have several characters to choose from, and from chaining matches or making several matches in a row they will send over character specific garbage blocks to the opponent. Instead of pushing the opponent off the top of the screen (though it is still a valid win condition) the main focus on the game is to be the first to reach a set score goal known as quota, and the unique trash blocks that each character sends will either give you score when the opponent clears them, or stalls to give you time to pull ahead.\n\nIt is in this regard that the character that you select matters more to your opponent then you, as your opponent is the one that deals with the character specific blocks, this makes mastery of all the different block types crucial to becoming very skilled at the game, as quick thinking on how deal with trash while minimizing the time spent waiting or score given to the opponent can make all the difference. Also since you are not flooding your opponent with trash blocks and instead focusing on scoring to get your quota up, it often means that late in a battle one miss drop won't completely take you out of the game like in Tetris or Puyo Puyo, and if your fast and skilled enough you can easily recover from a few mistakes.\n\nThe story in the game is light, but hints at a much larger world and story which I personally enjoy, though since it is a puzzle game if its not your thing then it can be skipped with no loss to the game play or anything. The music is excellent, which is important if you grind at the time attack or endless modes as, at least to me, it doesn't get old.\n\nThere are only a few minor bugs that I have come across, but as of now the developer is active and trying to sort them out. The main complaints I have are, controller support seems to be limited to Xbox controllers, I have tried a few other controllers that I have and seems to have trouble keybinding some of the buttons, and that as of now, I the online lobby's are almost always empty, but both can be solved, one with some bug fixing and hopefully this gem of a game will gain enough traction to solve the other as well.\n\n\nTLDR: This is a great game for anyone who loves arcade style competitive puzzle games, with few complaints and many positives and more then worth the price.","timestamp_created":1603485804,"timestamp_updated":1603485804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530516445636749268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3vTMq/UCfdfXqQI="}
