It's certainly shorter than 1st and 2nd, and generally somewhat less striking. However, it's pretty good if you don't expect the same sort of content. The short story 1993 included in the afterword is quite good, and honestly feels like more of a Narcissu title than the main story. On a sale, I think it alone can justify the purchase.","timestamp_created":1563043913,"timestamp_updated":1563043913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40qur9usCfc2lzgE="}
