    review: This game is nothing short of legendary, don't let the title fool you,
      this game is to be taken seriously and is a lot of fun.  It is a challenge platformer
      with fresh gimmicks and a challenging slant.  If you like your precision platformer
      games tough as nails but fair as a virgin maiden, look no further.
