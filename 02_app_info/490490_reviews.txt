The gampeplay is solid and although it's rather a small game there's a lot to experience between your modular gun, your different types of shields and ultimate abilities. The gun in particular has a total of 6 different parts which each affects a specific aspect of your gunplay, ammo type, shooting type, special effects, speed, magazine type etc and combined with the right shield selection it does play a big part in your performance so you'll have to find out for each level what works the best for you.\nThere is a daily challenge but the fat of the meat consists in a campaign of 4 levels which you can play in Casual or Hell difficulty, there is also an endless mode to beat the best score. I only played the campaign in Hell difficulty and could beat it in 7.5 hours, don't get me wrong it is challenging, each time you restarts a level you'll get the same waves of ennemies but the patterns will slightly differ just enough to keep you on your toes so you can't prefire everything that comes at you or dodge every bullets like if you already knew \"how to dance\".\nConsidering the VR Arcade FPS genre, it has one of the best intensity / comfort ratio, meaning that your head will go scracth the floor to dodge bullets from time to time and sometimes you'll be surprised and react violently to dodge but you won't sweat like a sponge in your VR Helmet.\nYes it is a small game but it's a very good one I fully enjoyed it, it was great. The only thing that's really lame is the Steam Achievment list, for once I wish I had something that shows that I beat the game in Hell mode because that was a real feat, I put a lot of energy to beat it. I beat it in hell but I know there's still a big margin between my achievment and what can be done to top the scoreboard, I have not really forced myself to try every combination of gun module+shields+ultimate possible there probably is some OP build hidden in there.","timestamp_created":1602869497,"timestamp_updated":1609528702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507672667503356934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww97Y3/YCcaqfqAI="}
