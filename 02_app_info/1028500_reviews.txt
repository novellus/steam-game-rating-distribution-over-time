Nightshade is an adventure game, emulated from the NES.  It is not perfect, for one the hotkey to load save states doesn't seem to work.  It's a more basic version of the emulator overall.  But it's functional.  Besides, you can take the ROM from the game data and use it in any other emulator if you wished.\n\nFor the game itself?  There's a lot of clever bits in it.  \"Game Overs\", for the first four time, are not actually game over screens.  You can escape the death traps.  As an adventure game, most of what you have to do is understandable.  There are a few points that don't make a lot of sense, but overall the game's not difficult to figure out.  There are combat sections as well, and those are let down slightly by the game not being that responsive.  Sometimes you'll have inputs dropped which can make you take some excess damage.  And healing is limited in the game.  Limited, but there ARE ways to defeat everything, usually you can figure out patterns that let you take minimal damage.  So there's enough healing to go around.  Once you start figuring the game out, everything fits nicely into place.  I played with save states to try to mitigate damage from combat and while trying various things, but it's also a game that's gated by knowledge.  So knowing what to do will help speed you through early parts of the game if you have to start over.\n\nI do recommend this game.  More people should check it out.  And I'm glad that someone's decided to preserve some NES games and make them accessible again, legally.","timestamp_created":1607457156,"timestamp_updated":1607457156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwurX6ofYCdrKguAI="}
