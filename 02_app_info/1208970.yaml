      \ /><br><br>The battlefield is always changing in this real-time strategy game,\
      \ so unit positioning is key. The hex grid maps allow a precise level of control\

      \ /><br>First, we have <strong>Delores the Invincible!</strong> A skilled, spirited\

      \ agent uses his greed to propel him to riches! His unbridled ambition allows\
      \ him to specialize in gaining intel on the battlefield and acquiring resources\

      \ /><br>Finally, we have <strong>Mikhail the Vigorous!</strong> As a young prince\
      \ from an alien race, Mikhail specializes in ambushing the opponent and stunning\
      \ them with brute force. Despite how he may seem, he\u2019s actually full of\

      \ /><br><br>Tactical Galactical contains a generous handful of units to use\
      \ in your army, including infantry, vehicular, and air units. All units move\
      \ along the hex grid, each with different strengths, weaknesses, attack ranges\
      \ and abilities. As the game proceeds in real time, you and your opponents will\
      \ be constantly racing to see who can outsmart who first. Can you break through\
      \ your opponent\u2019s defenses before they break through yours? Can you solve\
      \ the complicated puzzle of each new terrain makeup before they figure out a\
      \ killer strategy? Get ready to flex that analytical brain!<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br>While galactical warfare breaks out across the planet, your deployment\
      \ ship will remain stationed in the sky above, firing new units down in drop\
      \ pods and providing visibility to the tiles beneath. The fun part is that aside\
      \ from your units, you can control your ship as well, moving it where necessary\
      \ to deploy units exactly where you want them. But be careful - it takes time\
      \ for drop pods to open up, and they\u2019re vulnerable to enemy fire. You need\
      \ to protect your reinforcements!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1208970/extras/TitleCrossPlatform.png?t=1592386403\"\

      \ /><br><br>Want to become the strongest in the galaxy? Jump into cross-platform\
      \ multiplayer mode and crush all your friends in 1v1 or 2v2 matches! Multiplayer\
      \ is the real meat of the game - and where we spent the most time during development,\
      \ so this is where you can really put your skills to the test after learning\
      \ the ropes in the single player campaign!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1208970/extras/TitleSinglePlayer.png?t=1592386403\"\
      \ /><br><br>Before you jump into the challenging realms of multiplayer, we\u2019\
      ve also created a unique single player campaign with multiple missions spread\
      \ across different planets! Complete with wacky animated scenes just like a\
      \ real Saturday morning cartoon, this mode will entertain you and teach you\
      \ how to efficiently play as each different character. The AI will also pose\
      \ a decent challenge, preparing you for your battles against human opponents!"
