I was therefore very tempted when I saw this is the Winter sale and thought that I would give it a try. I am glad that I did.\n\nJust like ODD, the encounters on this game are tough, without being impossible one you understand how things work, and they are also infinitely varied, as you can use different combinations of spells, heroes and nemeses. I am looking forward to other expansions becoming available, and will be buying the War Eternal box for 'real' in the near future.","timestamp_created":1609421312,"timestamp_updated":1609421312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIq/3PYCePyMvwI="}
