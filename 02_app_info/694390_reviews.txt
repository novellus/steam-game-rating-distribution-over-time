It plays just like the base game and is very well done.  It took me 1.9 hours to finish my first run and a total of 7.2 hours to finish all the Achievements.  So, at about $4, the dollar-per-hour ratio is good.  At the bothersome level, for some reason the amount of homosexual stuff in this DLC seems more irritating then it was in the base game.  It's not a big problem, but I don't see the reason it's in the game at all.  So, bypassing that, the biggest issue I have with the game is that it takes an awful lot of work to get all the Achievements.  Basically, it takes a lot of saving/loading and the exploration of all the different combinations and permutations of the dialog/action trees.  Yes, I know that's really the point of these kinds of games.  But, I guess I've just gotten too old for that.  Anyway, I'm on the border.  Since there are currently only 5 reviews for the DLC, I guess I'll err on the side of generosity and Recommend it.","timestamp_created":1572974555,"timestamp_updated":1572974555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.410594761371612549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4992lnu4Cc8Pn1wE="}
