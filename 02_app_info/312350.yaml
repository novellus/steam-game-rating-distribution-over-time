    review: 'It''s rare to find a WWI game that isn''t a dense Grand Strategy with
      iffy mechanics or a underplayed FPS.  As a fan of Order of Battle, I stumbled
      upon this game, and it is as close as we''ll get to an Order of Battle-style
      game for WWI.  By that, I mean it''s a deep and functional wargame, but on lower
      difficulties it''s a fun ''watch my territory expand and stuff go boom'' game.


      It may be more fun than it is deep, but that''s not a bad thing.  I suggest
      giving this one a shot. You''ll know if you like it or not around 1.5 hours.


      Updated review: ok, won the war as both Central and Entente.  Remember to check
      troop promotions and promote your own regularly.  It also helps replentish troops.  Really
      fun game.


      If you''re not sure which to get, this or Strategic Command, get both.'
