Don't make any mistake, this game is HARD. It's a game in which you will fail, rage, fail and repeat, but that's what makes this game so good. You see, every time you fail a level you come away having perfected your approach just that tiny bit more. After a while you'll be fluent in the exact turns and brakes that need to be performed in order to complete it, and when you finally get it you will feel like a king. Every level feels like this challenge that you need to perfect, which also makes this game perfect for speedrunners. There are lots of little shortcuts that experienced players can take, which raises the skill ceiling a lot. The 'story' is also pretty fun and ties the levels together somewhat. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, casual challenge!","timestamp_created":1605167166,"timestamp_updated":1605167166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo+ba3fUCcO7xrQI="}
