    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Elven Legend: The Bewitched Tree" is a Strategy game that is developed and
      published by Growing Grass Studio.


      "The Bewitch Tree" is the second episode of "Elven Legend." Previous episode:
      "Elven Legend."


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that the audio in the game is well done even if it is simplistic
      and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s option menu
      as well.


      Gameplay


      This is a time management strategy game, where careful planning is required,
      due to the limited amount of resources that are available; hence the words "management"
      and "strategy."


      There are three game difficulty modes to choose from: Relaxed; Normal and Professional.
      The difference between these game difficulty modes: timer speed and scoring.
      In relaxed mode there is no timer and scoring. In casual mode, there is a timer
      and scoring, but the timer is slow to drain and scoring is low. In expert mode,
      there is a timer and scoring, but the time drains rather quickly and scoring
      is much higher.


      The star and score rating depends on a couple of factors: How fast the level
      was completed. How much resources are leftover. This only applies to the casual
      and expert mode. The star rating system: Three Stars (Gold;) Two Stars (Sliver)
      and One Star (Bronze.) There is an opportunity to replay all the levels for
      better scoring and star rating.


      There are a few special bonuses: Freeze Time; Worker Movement; Worker Speed;
      Additional Worker and Addition Resources. All of these special bonuses have
      a time limit. But they can be used once the bar has been filled up. These bonuses
      are extremely useful when the game is being played on expert mode.


      There are twenty-eight different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked.


      Miscellaneous


      There is an extra feature included in the game: Wallpapers. There are six different
      wallpapers; they can be accessed through the game''s main menu screen.


      There are eight different trading cards to collect. Only four of those trading
      cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the
      trading cards: Purchased from the Steam''s Community Market; Trade with friends;
      Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.


      Final thoughts: I do not think that this game has much of a replay value to
      it. If you are into time management strategy games. Then you might find this
      game somewhat enjoyable to a certain extent.'
