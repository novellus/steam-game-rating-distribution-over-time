    review: '[h1]Simplistic, boring action game.[/h1]


      I did not expect much from [i]Repa Games[/i], seeing that their games look like
      asset flips. This might be one. If not, it is otherwise a low-effort game.


      Store page also lies or at least exaggerates greatly. It lists the following
      features:


      [quote][olist]

      [*]Increasing Complexity

      [*] Dynamic Music

      [*] Beautiful Visual style[/olist][/quote]


      First, there''s three enemy types. Each has one straightforward attack pattern.
      The game progresses in "waves" that show diminutive differences to each other;
      maybe there''s slightly more enemies in each wave. I couldn''t tell the difference.


      Second, the music seems not dynamic at all. It''s a looping track, not different
      from calm to a fierce moment.


      Visual style is okay but I would not describe it as beautiful. It''s hardly
      even original.


      [h1]Obfuscated features and bugs[/h1]


      There''s no in-game story - you can read the incomprehensible blurb about [i]Kenbo[/i]
      on the store page instead.


      You have a pistol and an assault rifle that you access with mouse roll, but
      the game never tells you this. The weapons seem to have no differences, except
      the AR is better. Ammo is only counted per clip but you have infinite clips,
      so once I found the rifle, I never saw need to switch.


      No rebinding keys nor native controller support exists. WASD moves the soldier,
      and mouse is used to aim, shoot, and throw grenades. You can jump and even double-jump.


      There''s some tactic involved: grenades kill big dudes, while shooting is more
      efficient for small and fast runners and kamikaze birds (er, "gyrocopters").
      I noticed that the big dude could not even hit me if I stood still (did I mention
      it was low effort?!).


      Grenades do lots of damage to enemies *and* you. Sometimes, a grenade spawned
      seemingly randomly to my feet, which was confusing and made me wish for a quick
      health crate. In addition to health, crate drops contain grenades and instant
      screen-kills.


      [h1]Too long, simply boring game[/h1]


      Game never tells, not even on its store page how long it is. Well, I can now
      tell you: it''s ten (10) waves. Ten waves that last several minutes each and
      that are essentially identical. I will also tell you that it was incredibly
      boring. Also, if you die, you start over from wave 1, so while it''s fairly
      easy, you can''t ease out.


      It lasted for 1 hour. I only continued because I wanted the last achievement.
      The end came suddenly in mid-fight, before I killed the last enemies. The end
      screen was just black nothingness.


      Can you tell how [b]not recommended[/b] it is?*


      [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]


      (* Psst...! Not even on sale. I can''t believe I actually bought it.)


      EDIT addendum: [i]Kenbo[/i] might also be an asset flip. Here''s another game
      with similar gameplay according to trailer, called [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1387340/My_War/]My
      War[/url]. I''ll pass that one.'
