{"1220840":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"退休模拟器 Retirement Simulator","steam_appid":1220840,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"After retirement, you may feel that you have cats and dogs, ridiculed grandchildren, listened to tea, and supported them for years. In fact, there are quite a lot of pits in the real world. Can counterfeit medicines, fake health products, and pyramid schemes be safe and secure? The eldest son is getting divorced, the second son can't hang around and go home. The granddaughter has to go to a key school. You do n’t know how to get the money for the school district. My wife is in a hurry and is sick ... you can withstand the tons of life pressure ? Don't forget, you are the backbone of the whole family, and you have to fight the disease to live to be 100 years old. This &quot;Retirement Simulator&quot; allows you, who may be in a social animal, to feel the unlimited fun and sweetness of retirement in advance ...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game type is character development + roguelike + card strategy + text adventure. Yes, it is really developed. You can have a love relationship with some NPCs and come to the second spring of old age. We hope that you can experience all kinds of fun in the game. You can play with cats and dogs, or you can say a square dance battle with other grandpas. If you are in a bad mood, you can take your children out of your breath, count them down, or urge them to get married ...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlas, the game was made by our @ DoubleThink- 重思游戏 Studio, and said that it was the studio, but only me and an elder brother of the program who did not want to be named are working hard to develop it. The game will be available on Steam and PC this year, with very low pricing and no in-app purchases.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThank you for your support and care!","about_the_game":"After retirement, you may feel that you have cats and dogs, ridiculed grandchildren, listened to tea, and supported them for years.
