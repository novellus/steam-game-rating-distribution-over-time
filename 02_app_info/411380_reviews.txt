I've only just completed it, having to use \"Hardest quality\" weapons on most levels at normal difficulty, and needing \"Inferno quality\" weapons for the final level on normal.\n\nI will however, say that the fact that you can often approach the level strategically is fun, a nice change from the pure guns blazing style of the main game.\n\nBut, be warned, the difficulty here is...well...extreme.","timestamp_created":1547383002,"timestamp_updated":1547383002,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.422730714082717896","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwudrNo+gCe/uhuAE="}
