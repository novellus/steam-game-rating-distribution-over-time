Granted, I've only played this on 2014, not on Vanilla Rocksmith. Nonetheless, as a playable song, it's a pretty fun song that, while challenging for intermediate to master, has a lot of interesting elements for novices. I haven't played the song on the bass version (for which, it seems, Rocksmith songs seem to get most of their bad recommendations), but for regular guitar it's a pretty solid song, one of my guilty pleasure songs from the 90's.","timestamp_created":1467756476,"timestamp_updated":1467756476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.689119160175323486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5s7G3tUCdK+BXA=="}
