This ain't that substitute. This feels more like Developer's First Shmup, taking Asteroids and barely improving on it. The controls feel very off, and the enemy AI is downright terrible, there's no intelligence involved whatsoever, things just fly directly at you and hover on you once they get there. I don't normally knock spelling and grammar in games, since I know developers can come from anywhere in the world, but this one is particularly bad on that front. Space Pirates and Zombies or Ring Runner would definitely be the better games in this style to go with.","timestamp_created":1415250844,"timestamp_updated":1415250844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565088510513305664","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlsPhwckCcPfvMA=="}
