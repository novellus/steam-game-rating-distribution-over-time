In it, you match blocks to summon units. Whoever loses all their health first loses. It has decent voice acting, graphics, and music. \n\nMy only real complaint with this game is that it is a little light on content. After the story mode, which is short, there is not much left to do aside from multiplayer. Other than that, though, this game is a nice puzzle game that's worth a look. :)","timestamp_created":1549479713,"timestamp_updated":1549479713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588900864124298096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4joOM4ugCeYiXugE="}
