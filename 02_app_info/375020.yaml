    review: "Another game that I could go either way on recommending. Al Emmo's Postcards\
      \ from Anozira is a very barebones HOG. You can choose between 5 characters\
      \ in the beginning to be your guide as you go around the town to the different\
      \ HO scenes. There are 29 scenes in total, here\u2019s how they breakdown. You\
      \ are given items to find in a typical HO scene. Once completed, you get a puzzle\
      \ to do as well which finishes out that town\u2019s location. Rinse and repeat\
      \ until you hit all 29 locations. \n\nThe HO scenes graphics are dated and low-res.\
      \ So much so that it\u2019s difficult to make out certain objects which can\
      \ be frustrating. For a game that says it was released in 2010, I don\u2019\
      t know why they are this bad. Fortunately, you\u2019re given a generous amount\
      \ of hints you can use if you get stuck. \n\nThe puzzles that follow each HO\
      \ scene are either jigsaw, tile slide, rotating disc or spot the difference.\
      \ All of which are easy and shouldn\u2019t trip you up too much. Except for\
      \ the spot the differences. Each picture has 20 differences, but some of them\
      \ are very subtle and you will have to look very closely. Again, the poor resolution\
      \ doesn\u2019t help this. \n\nYou can go through the game normally or in \u201C\
      relaxed\u201D mode, which removes the timer for each scene & puzzle. I enabled\
      \ relaxed mode right away as I like taking my time on these games. Doing so,\
      \ you will miss out on extra points for completing a level quickly or finding\
      \ items in rapid succession. However, points don\u2019t have any meaning in\
      \ the game. \n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+Relaxed mode which removes the timer\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\
      +Crazy mouse acceleration in game\n+Low resolution graphics. Difficult to see\
      \ items clearly\n+Runs at a strange 42FPS? \n+Score is meaningless\n\nIn the\
      \ end, I can\u2019t recommend this game unless you are a big fan of the genre.\n\
      \n[b]4/10[/b] Below Average\n"
