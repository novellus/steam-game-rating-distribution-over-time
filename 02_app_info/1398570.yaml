      \ where you play as a cyborg Stephen. He is anxious to revenge everyone who\
      \ made him who he is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore that Stephen was a usual military.\
      \ After he was wounded hard, as a result, he was in coma. He was experienced\
      \ and eventually different mutations developed. Now he wants to revenge everyone\
      \ who made him who he is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are three large levels where\
      \ the key is. So the main aim of the game is looking for the keys which allow\

      \ There will be lots of monsters dreaming to kill you. Look for guns, ammo,\
