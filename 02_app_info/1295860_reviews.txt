The way to solve each \"puzzle\" is to guess\ncorrectly at what kind of shop should go where, and when to\nupgrade them. There is no strategy or clue decoding. There is a\nhelp button that tells you the correct answer, and that's\nbasically it.\n\nTower defense games give players choices and tradeoffs. Puzzle\ngames give players the tools they need to solve the puzzle. This\ngame gives players a bunch of things to try.\n\nPros: The music is nice. The flavor text is sometimes amusing.\nCons: It's not fun. I have trouble imagining anyone finding it fun.\n","timestamp_created":1602443716,"timestamp_updated":1602443716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544626593589782715","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603795147,"developer_response":"Hi! Thanks for sharing your feedback. We reworked the tutorial in a recent patch but here are a few pointers:\n\nEach entrance may contain a different amount of Dupes, but what really characterizes an entrance is its emission rate, the pace at which Dupes will be emitted (the number of Dupes per sec). Click on any entrance at night to see how many Dupes will come out of it during the next day. From day to day, the number and the frequency will both always rise progressively. But unlike the number of Dupes, which vary from map to map, the frequency is fixed by the color of the entrance and will always behave the same during the game according to its color. Across the different maps, you’ll encounter 4 types of emission rate, from the weakest to the strongest, recognizable by their color : green, yellow, blue, and purple. Green entrances will emit far less Dupes per second than the purple entrance will. \n\nAttendance needs to fit the shop capacity. Generally, the higher the buying cost of the shop, the bigger its capacity. So, the higher the attendance, the more capacity you’ll need, and the more expensive the shop should be that you need to place there.\nThese two very important indicators can also be reviewed at the end of each day. Using the toggle buttons at the bottom left of the summary capsule, you can display above each shop respectively how many Dupes were turned away due to a lack of space (the aim is to keep this number as low as possible), the daily income and the average occupancy rate (while trying to maximize those).\n\nFollowing these simple steps should generally get you easily out of the first milestones of each map, because fitting the shop capacity to the attendance is the key to reaching the objective, and will always yield honorable results.\nOnce you get acquainted to this base principle, you’ll naturally start to build your own much deeper strategies…\n\nHere is a guide with deeper explanations and some strategy tips:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2268942477"}],"cursor":"AoJw2tTFjPUCcv2mpwI="}
