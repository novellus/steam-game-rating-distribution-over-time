    about_the_game: "Endless Burst is a fresh take on the Bullet Hell arcade experience.\
      \ Challenge your skills and endurance as you fight and dodge your way through\
      \ overwhelming foes.<br />\r\nCustomize the way you play with 9 unique and upgradeable\
      \ classes. Unlock new powerful attacks and challenges as you progress. Procedurally\
      \ generated enemies, levels, and bosses keep the experience fresh as every new\
      \ battle is a unique challenge. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSelect from 9 upgradeable\
      \ classes, each with a unique play style. Whether you prefer to get up close\
      \ and personal, snipe your enemies from a distance, or focus on moving around\
      \ the hail of bullets, there's a class to suit your play style. As you progress,\
      \ upgrade them to make them stronger, faster, and unlock devastating special\
      \ attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree game modes are available. The default Mission\
      \ Mode pits you in large room-based dungeons for you to explore, loot, and hunt\
      \ the boss. Completing each level is challenging, but securing a victory will\
      \ reward you with extra rewards and even more formidable foes. Boss Rush allows\
      \ you to fight progressively more difficult bosses so you can hone your skills\
      \ in those one-on-one duels. Finally the Custom Challenge mode allows you to\
      \ face exactly what you want and how you want. On top of choosing the difficulty\
      \ and size of the level, you can add gameplay modifiers to increase the difficulty\
      \ in various ways in exchange for better rewards."

    review: "Very strange game almost more like Zelda than a bullet hell shooter.\
      \  It's also a roguelike but it's just way too easy to die from one tiny mistake\
      \ and have to start all over.  The attack mechanics aren't very satisfying since\
      \ you can't really aim where you shoot.  \n\nCool graphics and atmosphere but\
      \ it didn't hold my interest.  Music is nice."
