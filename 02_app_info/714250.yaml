    review: "The graphics look great and it almost looks like a great fantasy game\
      \ to try and play but it's not for people who like to play with keyboard controls\
      \ AT ALL.\n\nI have never been able to successfully start a game with this game.\
      \ I have a controller but do not like to use it for MMO/RPG style games, but\
      \ this game forces you to. \n\nControlling the character with WASD, Mouse, and\
      \ keyboard is simply not allowed. You MUST use your controller, then you must\
      \ know what buttons like RB, and others that aren't the normal 4 mean. (Sorry,\
      \ I don't. I'm not a Nintendo gamer. I'm used to playing WASD, keys, and mouse\
      \ for RPGs and MMOs and such like Skyrim, World of Warcraft, etc.. I typically\
      \ only use controllers for shoot 'em up/arcader games). \n\nI would change this\
      \ review if this game had the option to change movement to keyboard in the game\
      \ options but it doesn't. No options to use anything but a controller at all,\
      \ and very user unfriendly. \n\nIF you know what all the button signals it gives\
      \ for the controller mean you should have no problems with this game."
