You find it in the folder called Shadowrun 5th Edition in the Extra folder.  The Extra folder will be in the Shadowrun Chronicles game folder.  I was able to copy the folder to my documents folder and open the pdf.  It has 489 pages full of words, tables and pictures.   Looked like any other Source book from the various publishers of the Shadowrun universe. This is the latest from Catalyst games publisher.  This is the Rule book for Shadowrun pen and paper game version 5.  There is also a separate character sheet pdf and Errata pdf. You also need a large number of 6 sided dice to play.  \n\nGet it if you are interested in being a GM for Shadowrun PnP game or going to play Shadowrun on paper.  Better if you buy on deep sale.\n\nhttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115985/Shadowrun-Fifth-Edition-Core-Rulebook\n\nhttps://store.catalystgamelabs.com/\n\nhttp://www.shadowruntabletop.com/products-page/getting-started/shadowrun-fifth-edition/","timestamp_created":1496457503,"timestamp_updated":1496597535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.713848710060119629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcOKutwCddHOeg=="}
