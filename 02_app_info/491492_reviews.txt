Read carefully as there are two versions you can buy.  The more expensive one comes with liveries.","timestamp_created":1578423354,"timestamp_updated":1578423354,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqaDXwO8CdbHG6gE="}
