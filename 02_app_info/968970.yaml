    review: "Lots of bugs but non of them game breaking so far.  Economy sucks .\n\
      \u0130 realized steam library asked to review and from there i did a mistake\
      \ i thought it released. game still in early access . anyway still playing and\
      \ had 2-3 total crash . game economy sucks its really hard to make money . to\
      \ pay your depth and buy new toys for your self .... played like 45 hours and\
      \ have 30k . and have to pay 250k just to complete a quest. after that quest\
      \ i can buy planting equipment. \n\u0130 still recomend the game its really\
      \ fun to play with good environment very cool side quests can be add. holding\
      \ RMB is a pain ( Special View ) . developers must do some on - off for that."
