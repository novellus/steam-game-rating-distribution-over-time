    review: "Game graphics are pretty amazing Good. It's a good puzzle type game with\
      \ nice story, dialogues. \nBut, I really hate, every single time on loading\
      \ screen, game freezes and i have to force close, It's only happening when game\
      \ load on a next mission like that circle loading screen. Overall, Good game.\
      \ Hope this fix soon.\n\n#update: Seems i recently found that, my Antivirus\
      \ was the problem. Just to be check, i have disable temporary, and i was able\
      \ to play it normally without any crashes, so i now switch my negative to positive."
