It's a neutral recommendation. I am rating this game a 5 out of 10. It's very bland and mediocre. But it has some merit. I think kids may enjoy playing this, especially after the parent has upgraded some of the abilities.\n\nSo the good? There's lots of heroes. The bad? You'll be lucky to unlock more than 1. This game is a grind. It's a grind to unlock heroes and it's a grind to upgrade their abilities. Once you upgrade their ability to MAX (takes a freaking long time), then the whole game is very easy. Perfect for kids under 10 years old or so.\n\nYou get to be Iron Man to start off with. Sounds cool right? Yeah, but i isn't, not in this game. You basically shoot this laser out of your hands or alternatively launch rockets. You can upgrade either ability. I recommend only upgrading the laser ability because the rocket launcher tends to drop frame rates fast. \n\nThen you unlock Green Arrow or Hawkeye or whatever hero uses a bow. Wow, this is pretty bad. Bad, but easy bow mechanic. Definitely upgrade the exploding talent. You arm will get tired from having to shoot too many enemies with this hero. \n\nSo after 1 hour I managed to fully upgrade Ironman and halfway upgrade Hawkeye. The enemy AI is dumb. They literally run around in circles. The unlocks are too grindey. I'm not sure I ever want to play this game after 1 hour, I don't care about the other heroes. The levels all look the same in any event.\n\nRate 5/10. I bought it for .99 cents and I think I got .99 cents value if I ever have kids.","timestamp_created":1530747971,"timestamp_updated":1530748012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558266699314117432","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qDss+QCf52bpQE="}
