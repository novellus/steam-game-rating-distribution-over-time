If you like searching every nook and cranny of the map to find hidden secrets and monster fights, you will get your fix here.  The soundtrack will remind you of classic RPGs like Chrono Trigger and the SNES Final Fantasy games. With the expansion pack content, the amount that there is to do in this game seems limitless. I would give it a try if you're in the mood for a well designed JRPG game.","timestamp_created":1609301091,"timestamp_updated":1609301091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q7z02PYCdP7UvgI="}
