    review: "Cute exploration game.\n\nControls play best with a controller - having\
      \ tried both ways.\nIf you can't move with controller at first, and you see\
      \ the mouse cursor, click in the game window with mouse once first.\n\nStore\
      \ page blurb text should really say \"Controller Recommended\".\n\nPlayed on\
      \ Medium graphics settings, and was only about as clunky as I'd expect a slightly\
      \ slow, non-agile, jellyfish swimming to be. ;)  \n(Remember to use BOTH joysticks\
      \ - left for movement, right for camera, use both while rotating)\n\nA good\
      \ buy on sale - I got it for 80% off.\n\nAt time of review, I've unlocked 2\
      \ of the seemingly 4 different fish.\n\nCons:  only one save-file & no confirmation\
      \ dialog - so be careful not to select \"New Game\" instead of \"Load Game\"\
      .  \nI confirmed this when deliberately re-starting after my first 8 minutes.\
      \ \n(out of 26 minutes total at the time of review)"
