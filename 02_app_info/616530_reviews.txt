For only a few bucks more than the original game, you get an awesome art book (I'd estimate 100 plus pages of illustrations, concept art, etc.) plus some nice backgrounds (some of them are a bit repetitive but some of them are really quite nice) and the crowning jewel.. the OST! I'd say the OST is worth the extra few bucks in itself, just because the music in this game is fantastic, reminds me a lot of retro style or retro inspired soundtracks like Mega Man or Shovel Knight, for example. If you enjoy \"Flinthook\" which IMO anyone in their right mind would enjoy this game, then I'd say the deluxe addition is worth it!","timestamp_created":1493103700,"timestamp_updated":1493103700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.742666423320770264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgs360dsCcN/Mdw=="}
