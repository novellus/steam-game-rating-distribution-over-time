So much better than the Snowfallen sets, imo. \n\nWX-78, Woodie, and Wigfrid are soooo good here. I appreciate Klei's ability to always make WX-78 something completely unique and interesting every time. And I feel Woodie and Wigfrid hairstyles and clothes here are much superior to default and still really capture who they are as characters. \n\nThis skin set is worth it for Wigfrid's new hairstyle alone---- You can't prove me wrong. \n\nOf course, everything came exactly as described and by purchasing these sets, you're giving Klei money to keep adding new free content to the game.","timestamp_created":1594239946,"timestamp_updated":1594239946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0eGGmPMCfd3wkwI="}
