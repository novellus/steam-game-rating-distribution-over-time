    review: As with the original, the additional soundtrack for Ori and the Blind
      Forest is beautiful and captivating. The melodies are enthralling and moving.
      The power of the songs is both subtle and fierce. I recommend this soundtrack
      wholeheartedly; it is breathtaking and a pure joy to listen to and be absorbed
      by.
