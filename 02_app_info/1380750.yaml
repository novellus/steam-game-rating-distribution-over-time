      fast-paced 2D space shooters? Where timing is important and success is sweet?
      With lots of satisfying destruction and explosions? Then read no further, this
      should be very much to your liking. (Actually just kidding, do keep on reading.)<br><br>Art
      of Space is essentially madness, as can be seen below.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1380750/extras/clustermess2.gif?t=1608266938"
      /><br><br>Inspired by online and offline space shooters of the last two decades,
      Art of Space aims to provide a similar feel/atmosphere, putting an emphasis
      on fun gameplay mechanics while the campaign is reminiscent of the early days
      of online gaming.<br><br>Art of Space gives you the chance to build a spaceship
      and tweak it to your very own tastes, both visually and stats-wise. This game
      is for people who love to try all sorts of different combinations to figure
      out that ONE sweet-spot build that feels just right.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1380750/extras/betterswap.gif?t=1608266938"
      /><br><br>If you're more of a &quot;mad skillz!!&quot; person, you will love
      the combat in Art of Space as fast-paced is what we do, and perfect timing is
      what we love. Your spaceship is a modular machine that can be destroyed and
      rebuilt bit by bit, all in the heat of battle.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1380750/extras/skirmish2.gif?t=1608266938"
      /><br><br>Meanwhile, our single-player story-driven campaign aims to provide
      a narrative around the world of Art of Space, while providing many hours of
      entertainment to the player.<h2 class="bb_tag">What this game offers:</h2><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> Manoeuvre your weapon of destruction through hazardous asteroid
      fields as you take out foes and defend allies using a wide array of weapons
      and utilities.<br></li><li> Build a fully modular spacecraft from a pool of
      ship parts and weapons.<br></li><li> Tweak your ship's stats and utility slots.<br></li><li>
      Follow along a story-driven campaign that will provide many hours of entertainment.<br></li><li>
      Test your skills in the Endless mode to see how you measure up to others, or
      just take it easy and use it as a playground to try out your newest configuration.</li></ul>
