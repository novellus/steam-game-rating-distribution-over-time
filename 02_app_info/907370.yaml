      This DLC has 4 more characters, with better animation, more CGs and more enchanting\

      \ in high school. She was raised by her divorced mom. They didn't have much\
      \ and her mom was always away on business trips. She was so alone and helpless\
      \ that, even got picked in school, she had no one to turn to. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n2. Madoka<br />\r\nShe was often sick as a child, and lived with her\
      \ brother. They moved a lot and they have no money or time for school. Although\
      \ she's already come of age, she still messes around like a kid. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n3. Mafercca Rossi<br />\r\nA young witch who lives in the forest and\
      \ focuses on arcane and alchemy. She doesn't know much beside those two, even\
      \ a bit clumsy. She also hates those who believe violence can solve everything.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Hill<br />\r\nIn her 19 years of being, she spent 16\
      \ of them as a slave. Although she remains meek about her status quo, and she\
      \ follows her master's commend to the letter. There seems to be a small fire\
      \ that  is breaking out."
