    about_the_game: 'Once upon a time, in a small, unremarkable village, there was
      a timid little boy who didn''t have any friends. One day, while playing alone
      in his bedroom, he was rudely interrupted by a family of dirty rats. Chasing
      them out of his room, the little boy suddenly found himself lost in a vast,
      mysterious forest, where he happened upon a magical crown that imbued him with
      the power to command. The little boy -- with his newfound companions Liam, Verde,
      and Howser the Bull Knight at his side -- has (rather surprisingly) become the
      leader of the small, down-on-its-luck kingdom of Alpoko.<br><br>With his newfound
      powers of persuasion, the little boy began working to raise Alpoko from the
      depths of obscurity and poverty into the dizzying heights of absolute power
      and prosperity. With Howser offering effective advice and unrestrained ambition,
      and the citizens of Alpoko sharing his grandiose plans (whether they want to
      or not), the little boy marches ever onward to his ultimate goal of World Domination!<br><br>Initially
      released for Wii to rave reviews, this cult classic real-time strategy game
      juxtaposes cutesy fairytale visuals with some decidedly adult cynicism for a
      zany, irreverent adventure to build, enhance, and maintain a mystical, magical
      kingdom. Making its way to PC for the first time, this edition of the game remains
      faithful to the Wii original, but brings all its charming, sassy fun to a new
      audience. Can you keep Alpoko safe from the Onii and help our little hero become

    short_description: Once upon a time, a little boy from our world found himself
      in another, more mystical world where a magical crown made him ruler over a
      floundering kingdom called Alpoko. You are this little boy, and it's your duty
      to make Alpoko great...so you can then expand its dominion and take over the
      world!
