The amount of customisation is surprisingly good. There are currently some bugs but the game will get better as it develops. With most being resolved by saving so if the game closes you just load a save you made, loosing near to no progress. Doesn't take long to get used to the controls either. Just make sure to read what the help says and you'll be set. Other than that, it is an enjoyable game.","timestamp_created":1589493757,"timestamp_updated":1589493757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xL7NivICfefghwI="}
