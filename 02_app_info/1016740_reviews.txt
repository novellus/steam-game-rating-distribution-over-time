Notably, the controls in this one basically don't work, and one of the early story missions can't be completed because the last enemy falls off the map but you still have to kill them to proceed. Also the translation is gibberish, but that was probably implied in \"Chinese grindan MMO.\"\n\nAlso there's a cash shop because of course there is. It's in RMB though so it's hilariously cheap, but the fact the game is nonworking and terrible more than makes up for this.\n\nNot recommended for anyone.","timestamp_created":1567039454,"timestamp_updated":1567039454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507341623306274414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws4+17ewCfayk0QE="}
