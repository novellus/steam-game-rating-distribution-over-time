    review: "Why would you make it disabled by default? \n\nThis is not a free DLC,\
      \ I understand that it is a way to support the developers and I paid it for\
      \ this unnecessary feature because I like the base game, but every time I loaded\
      \ the game I forgot to enable it and missed some lines of Ransome the *Beeping*\
      \ Clown. \n\n*Beep* you developers!"
