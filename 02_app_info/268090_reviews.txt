For $1 you get just over 6 HOURS of really great game music.  No idea why they are charging so little for this soundtrack, but I'm not complaining.  It's easily worth a good bit more though and I would've happily paid $10 just as quickly, especially now that I know how much music is here.  10/10 for sure :)","timestamp_created":1609514459,"timestamp_updated":1609514459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ497Oi3/YCecW2vwI="}
