    about_the_game: In the game, as a commander, you only need to give your knight
      commands through visual programming, they will automatically execute and defeat
      the enemy (of course, if the command is wrong, your knight will be defeated
      ).<br><br>what? Visual programming?<br><br>Yes, it is a programming game. But
      you don't have to worry about not programming, because in the game you only
      need to create commands, connect commands, click send commands, and everything
      is done - yes, it's as simple as this is &quot;visual programming&quot; ^_^.<br><br><strong><i>*

    review: "I've only put 20 minutes into this, and don't think I care to finish,\
      \ but as a 3$ game, I'll give this a weak recommendation. There are certainly\
      \ better games out there and this won't take long to complete or greatly challenge\
      \ the player. Its mechanics aren't super interesting. \n\nHowever, this is the\
      \ dev's first game and I want to be supportive of anyone coming out with a new\
      \ idea on limited resources. I hope to see more from them and for them to expand\
      \ better on their concepts."
