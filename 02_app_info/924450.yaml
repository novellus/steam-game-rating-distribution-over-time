      \ Alice, dumped him, taking their daughter away from him. Now he must return\
      \ home at the request of his ailing father, who wishes to see his granddaughter\
      \ before it\u2019s too late. But things take a turn for the absurd when Ray\
      \ realises his daughter and her mother have built a new life with his former\
      \ P.E. teacher, a controlling and regimented figure who is the direct opposite\
      \ of Ray. After Ray is found sleeping in his beat up car outside their home,\
      \ Alice feels guilty enough to invite him to stay. From his first bumbling efforts\
      \ to get close to his daughter - who treats him with complete contempt - to\
      \ the catastrophic effect his presence has on Frank- he manages to create chaos\
      \ all around him."
