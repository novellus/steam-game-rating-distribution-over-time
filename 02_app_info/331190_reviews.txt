I repeat, DO NOT. It will make you hate your life and the game. Aside from that, the game is OKAY. Its not amazing. But everything about it is decent. Everything from the character movement, levels, mechanics, enemys, graphics could be better IMO. But it's worth a playthrough. But I repeat, DO NOT attempt master mode initially.","timestamp_created":1596388191,"timestamp_updated":1609302780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhvX62PYCdtGAmQI="}
