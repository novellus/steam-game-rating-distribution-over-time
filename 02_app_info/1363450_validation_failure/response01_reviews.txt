With the \"Hand of God\" feature it makes it easy to relocate an animal if they escape their enclosure. But be careful as the animal can glitch out of existence making selling and re-buying the animal building again a necessity.\n\nIf all animals are used with a large Inn, land space gets cramped and farming will have to be minimized.\n\nFor the Sheep, Cow and Goat buildings place fencing only around the animal opening front of the buildings, leaving free the rear door for worker access to feed and collect product. The \"green person\" (Staff access point) is buried inside the rear door and almost impossible to see when placing building. It is possible to build the Sheep, Cow and Goat buildings in a row to economize space with a few fence pieces at the rear corners and a long fenced enclosure along the front, leaving all the rear doors accessible.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2226279001\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2226279596\n\nFor Chickens, Geese and Turkey buildings, fencing can also be built around the animal opening front, leaving the side wall Staff access point open. The Staff access for the Duck building is at the rear. Watch for the \"green person\" when placing the building to see this. It is possible to build a square bird enclosure to economize space leaving all Staff Access points open with buildings as the corners and a few fence pieces between the buildings.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2226278016\n\nTroughs are only for Horses. If a Trough is placed in an Animal enclosure a Horse will try to get to it even if it has to enter the Inn to do it. Bad placing of these can have bad effects. Best left at the front of the Inn ... think of usa old wild west movies.","timestamp_created":1599613445,"timestamp_updated":1599869337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42pfpv/QCetrWoAI="}
