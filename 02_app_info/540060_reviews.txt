She is offered a job at a local boutique, which is where we come in, and the game offers a nice introductory level to help us get started if we are not familiar with what we need to do.  Soon afterwards, it transpires that Angela's heroine, the fashion designer Truly, is holding a televised competition to find the most talented, exciting new designer to ultimately replace her - which will take place over 5 exotic locations (in addition to the starting point of the boutique) containing 15 levels each.  Of course, Angela is hopeful of being selected to appear on the show.  Will she get there?  And if so, what will happen?  Life is never that simple..\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIs exactly what you would expect from this type of game: serve a series of customers with the item(s) and/or service(s) they want within a timeframe that keeps them happy, in order to earn points which you can then cash in for additional features to make your efforts quicker and/or more efficient as the levels progress.\n\nIn this game, those bonuses can be purchased for the duration of each location, such as an extra changing room or additional make-up table so you can serve more customers concurrently; or be repurchased one level at a time, like the magician who performs a trick and improves everybody's mood, which effectively boosts their patience timer and gives you longer to serve them before they leave in a frustrated rage.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n- The story is told via cutscenes between each of 90 playable levels, and it is this which really holds the game together and maintains player interest.  It is very well written and you will find yourself cheering on certain characters whilst pantomime-jeering others as their true natures become apparent.\n- Aurally the game also performs well, there is a lovely cheerful introductory song and respectable accompaniments throughout.\n- Graphics are right up to scratch for the type of challenge, clean and quickly identifiable as they need to be, whilst remaining colourful in keeping with the overall theme; and some of the dress options are gorgeous.\n- Responsiveness to clicking appeared to be flawless.  Even during my most frenetic activity, I never had to click the same thing twice to be sure that Angela would respond accordingly.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- There are a number of additional “challenges” thrown in to many of the levels, such as having supplies delivered to the wrong place and having to move them across the room in between serving all the customers; or having to prevent an underhand competitor from sneaking in and sabotaging your work.  These are fun at first, but are very limited in variety and the same ones repeat over; which makes them increasingly tiresome as you progress further.\n- While crediting the developers for throwing in little extras to challenge the player, I feel that some of these additions simply don't work well.  There is a mouse in the majority of the levels which you need to find and click on; but it is very small, often hidden behind other scenery so you can see only part of it, and it doesn't stay visible for very long.  When you are really busy keeping up with demand, unless you are very lucky and just-so happen to look in the right spot at the right time, you are likely to miss it altogether.\n- Most of the achievements in game are fun to get, but one of them demands you score 500,000 points in total; and you are not going to get very near to that when you have played right through the game, which effectively forces you into grinding some levels over and over to get there.  An avoidable introduction of grind is [i]never[/i] a smart move.  Throw in the likelihood of mouse-spotting adding to that inevitability, and you have some player frustration in a game which could have easily been completely free of it.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nOverall, the negatives in the game are pretty small and pale in comparison to the fun that you should have from playing it.  There is a lot of repetition – as is the nature of the genre, I suspect – but the gameplay levels are split by delightfully enjoyable cutscene story updates, and a desire to see how everything pans out should be comfortably enough to keep you invested until the conclusion.\n\nAt full price, this game costs £10, which might be a touch above fair value, but on offer (and at time of typing, it is less than half price), it becomes a bargain.  If you like time management games, or fun stories, or simply fashion, then [i]Angela's Fashion Fever[/i] should appeal; and if you like all three of those, then the question is, why haven't you bought it already?\n\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one!
