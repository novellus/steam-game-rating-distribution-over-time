The soccer rules and soccer field embedded into the table is really cool and fun to play.\n\nTable is moderately easy, you don't lose ball a lot. Mind you, the various teams are color/music schemes only, the basic layout of the table stays the same. I went with FC Barcelona, but after a while I find the music a little annoying, so maybe choose another one ;-)","timestamp_created":1441053208,"timestamp_updated":1441053208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645551741123199463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3N3dws8CeLL8Qw=="}
