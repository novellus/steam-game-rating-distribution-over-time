Now let me give you some criticism; 1. I think that characters could get some work (face or body gestures) Idle poses are 'fine' but they just give a lazy-uninspired vibe of a game overall. 2. The classroom background is bright, like [b]bright[/b]. It burned my eyes through all the game. 3. The CG Gallery is bugged, It just show 1 CG. And finally! 4. It would be nice to have an Spanish translation if you don't mind, it can be easier to get to more people.\n\nThe story was nice, but I got the bad ending in my first playthrough and I really don't understand why, maybe I missed something along the lines but I don't know why she would do that. I need answeeers. And even when I get the 'good' ending the story ends so abruptly!\n\nFor my review:\nI think this is a game from a starter-tier developer, don't expect a higly elaborate VN 'cause it's just not meant to be. It's a great soul-made work, a short cold and warming story for fxf-love seekers.\n\nHopefully, I would like to see more of your works on Steam, dev.
