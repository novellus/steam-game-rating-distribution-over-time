    review: "I can't really say how appropriate this music is to the game it accompanies...largely\
      \ because I haven't played so much as five minutes of said game yet. But I CAN\
      \ say, for such a moody-lookin' game, this sure-as-sh*t ain't a moody f*ckin'\
      \ soundtrack.\n\n   Look, it's fine. It's sufficiently melodic, very well produced,\
      \ and offers a whole lotta tracks for not a lotta cash. I guess that, er, \"\
      chilled urban grooves\" (taking a punt here) just ain't my cup of tea. I bought\
      \ this soundtrack in the hopes that it would at least be at the cuter end of\
      \ spooky, but it's nothing of the sort. \n\n   I'll give it a thumb-up, but\
      \ only barely, and would only seriously recommend it to anyone whose musical\
      \ tastes never swerve from the dead-set middle of the road.\n\n   Verdict: 5.5/10.\n\
      \n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages:\
