EXCEPT people who thrive on bullet-hell \"impossible\" games.  If that's your thing, then have a go at this one and be proud of yourself if you get past the third level.  If you just want a FUN space/flight combat game that you don't get frustrated and throw your controller out the window after ten minutes, this game is not for you.  Me, personally, I don't want my gaming experience to cause frustration.  I play after work, or on weekends, when I want to relax and forget about the facts that I am homeless and have an incurable disease that is slowly killing me.  I want stress relief, not added frustrations.\n\nMusic is crap, sound effects are terrible, there is no volume or mute option, there is no options menu at all.  The combat is simple to learn, controls are fluid, but the difficulty is UNFORGIVING TO AN EXTREME.  One hit will kill you, then you respawn right back in the middle of the mess that just killed you but now there are even more bullets flying around the screen so you instantly die again... and again... and one more time for the game over.  You have a shield but it's only good for about two seconds and is manually activated.  Then if you manage to get to the first boss good luck dodging the crazy amount of bullets it shoots at you... oh wait you can't dodge because it shoots sticky webs that prevent you from moving and then you die.\n\nJust, no.  Forget this game and go buy something less masochistic and more fun.","timestamp_created":1577046436,"timestamp_updated":1577046436,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463917523622512817","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwit3Sl+8CfJWY5gE="}
