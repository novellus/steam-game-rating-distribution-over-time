    about_the_game: 'Welcome to the strange and miraculously existent world of Nigel:
      The Minuscule Adventure! Explore a not too vast and not very satisfying adventure
      as Nigel travels across 3 worlds in search of reversing a manifestation created
      by poor life choices and burnt eggs. Meet new adventurers to join your party,
      complete quests for those you meet along the way, and most importantly: Have
      fun for a minuscule amount of time in comparison to other, much more popular
      video games. Nigel: The Minuscule Adventure is an open-world RPG adventure that
      comes with 3 possible (and very astonishingly similar) endings for extra replay-ability,
      if you wanted that for some reason. Battle strange creatures by taking turns
      (because there is... um.. Maaagic.. that uh, makes people take turns when they
      fight) in hopes of reversing the chaos which you have created. Be sure to support
      me to allow me to create new (and hopefully much better) video games in the
      future. I don''t have a Kickstarter or a Patreon or anything, just support me
      in thought, I guess.'
