    review: "I really love Metroidvanias and would really like to give this a thumbs\
      \ up BUT\n\n- How can it be that you lose 80% health by just walking through\
      \ a door? A door that you walked through three times before!\n\n- How ist it\
      \ that you have this gravity spin and it just works when IT WANTS to work? \n\
      \nThis is not hard as nails, this is xxxx\n\nPro:\n- Good retro atmosphere\n\
      - Crisp controller feeling\n- Soundtrack\n\nI do not refund because I like \
      \ support people that produce Metroidvanias."
