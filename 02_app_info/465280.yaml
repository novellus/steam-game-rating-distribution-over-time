    review: "I've said I recommend the game, but it's with caveats. I bought the game\
      \ with 90% off - at that price it's worthwhile. I would not pay full price.\
      \ \n\nI enjoyed the story, and the overall visual and gameplay style reminded\
      \ me of Monkey Island.  The visuals are nice.\n\nThat said, some things I didn't\
      \ like were:\n- The debug screen coming up when you hit LT and RT. I don't know\
      \ how this is still in there when there are years of complaints about it. \n\
      - The game mechanic is a bit awkward at times. Why do I have to look a person\
      \ up and down and associate an item with that particular spot of them, not just\
      \ associate it with the person? \n- Who on earth thought the control for the\
      \ cypher/dials was acceptable. \n- Sometimes the controls were a little janky...\
      \ I used an Xbox controller, but honestly, I think this type of game is better\
      \ with a mouse, where you can click anywhere on the screen, not have to navigate\
      \ to a point for a hotspot to show."
