Although the abilities were simple and straightforward, they certainly aided in the completion of some of the more challenging levels. I also liked the tension created by the time pressure cards present on the tableau. If you remove too many other cards without removing the time pressure obstacles, a card will either be subtracted from your deck or added to the board, depending on the obstacle color. Blue obstacles remove a card from your deck, while orange ones add an additional one to the tableau. \n\nAs always, there is room for improvement. Although the player can have up to two uses for each ability, the in-game display does not indicate how many uses you have remaining. Therefore, you'll sometimes be caught off guard (having only one use of an ability when you thought you had two), and may not be able to finish levels that you thought you had \"in the bag.\"\n\nThere are also level obstacles that cannot be removed unless the player achieves a streak of perhaps four card removals. This isn't a bad idea in theory, but since the layouts are randomized, there are times when you just can't achieve the streak necessary with the cards available. You'll remove all the cards above the obstacles and then be forced to restart the level in hopes of a more favorable draw. This never feels good.\n\nIf you also enjoy this style of game and have played most of the more popular iterations on Steam, DigiMight isn't the worst developer you could check out next.","timestamp_created":1605536866,"timestamp_updated":1605536866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477561056613922119","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Yvd6PUCeM/drgI="}
