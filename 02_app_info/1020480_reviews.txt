The concept is simple, but it's a fun one to play with a friend via local co-op, and the game has enough levels to keep you occupied for a few sittings.  The Battle Mode is a nice extra feature as well.  Easily worth the buck it'll cost you.","timestamp_created":1549698382,"timestamp_updated":1549698382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5fO6OgCcuuzugE="}
