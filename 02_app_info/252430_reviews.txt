Every time I start it, my monitor turns blank and nothing happens. Most annoying ist that once that happens, there is no way you can stop the game running, neither Alt+F4 nor windows-button nor task manager work. So you hav to manually switch off your computer every time. As you can see from other reviews and from the forums, this problem has persisted for years and developers could not be assed to fix it. The fix that is proposed in the forums has also stopped working. Gonna ask for a refund, fuck this game.","timestamp_created":1594416668,"timestamp_updated":1594416668,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vOonfMCcqW1lAI="}
