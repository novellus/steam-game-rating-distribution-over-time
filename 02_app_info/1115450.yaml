    review: Currently it's one of those "I wish there was neutral" reviews. The gameplay
      is ok, nice to build, although the placement is a bit wonky, can't get stuff
      neatly packed easily, roads placement snaps only to ends of stretches of roads
      you've placed and sometimes their colouring "pours" over buildings when you
      put them too close, making the buildings look brown. Biggest issue is lack of
      purpose besides building everything. Also it's quite easy to survive, just put
      a few people on farming and you're set (also you can keep farming throughout
      winter, which is weird). As it is, I wouldn't recommend purchasing unless you're
      a big fan of the genre and want to try it badly. I usually get way more hours
      from any game of the genre, this one just doesn't have more than a few hours
      of gameplay in it's current state. Hopefully more gets added and it gets better.
