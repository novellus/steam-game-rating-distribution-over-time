    about_the_game: '<strong>Catch the celebrity.<br>Avoid the paparazzi.</strong><br><br>Paparazzi
      is a <strong>local multiplayer</strong> game of cat-and-mouse. The celebrity
      runs, dashes, and hides while the paparazzi tries to take constant photos of
      them. It''s a simple yet competitive arcade-action game with a Where''s Waldo
      feel. It''s a test of focus and reflexes and a silly take on celebrity culture.<br><br>Each
      match is a tug-of-war battle between a celebrity (battling for dignity) and
      a paparazzo (battling for money). When the paparazzo player takes a picture
      of the celebrity, the paparazzo gains money while the celebrity loses dignity.
      If the celebrity collects an adoring fan, they regain a chunk of their dignity.
      At the end of each round, when the celebrity reaches the limo, the winner is
      the player that has more dignity or money!<br><br>Matches can be played multiplayer,
      with one celebrity player and one paparazzo, or single player as celebrity vs.
      a paparazzo AI. <br><br>NOTE: This game was intended to played with your friends!
      We''ve got a single player mode for you to hone your celebrity skills, but the
      intent of the game is to bring friends together in fun competition!<br>The game
      also supports Xbox 360 controller, which is the preferred way to play celebrity!<br><br>The
      game contains:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Six unique levels<br></li><li>Seven
      silly characters<br></li><li>Four celebrity powerups<br></li><li>A big handful
      of dumb jokes</li></ul>'
