It's such a weird experiment but it's wild to think that so many of these recorded answers are statements that people would never make to their own family and/or friends.   It's also interesting that in about an hour of listening to the recorded answers, there was never a \"bad\" one.  Simply absolute strangers peeling back their psyche and explaining deep failures and thoughts to someone they'll never hear from themselves.   This isn't a fun experience but it's an intensely insightful one.","timestamp_created":1609048951,"timestamp_updated":1609049035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556313991546630859","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j/qy0fYCee7SvQI="}
