    reviews: "\u201CI\u2019ve been more frustrated by Duet than by any other game\
      \ this year; on the flip side, few other games are as fun when you succeed.\
      \ The game has a clever premise: instead of controlling one character, you control\
      \ two\u2014little dots that are linked together, occupying opposite spots on\
      \ a single circle. Move a character right, and the other moves left.\u201D<br><a\

    short_description: Elegant and minimal, Duet asks players simply to navigate two
      orbiting spheres past an increasingly complex maze of falling obstacles. As
      the difficulty increases, the tension mounts, and a peculiar narrative unfolds.

    review: 'This is one of those mobile masterpieces that are 100% worth the time
      and money. The mechanics are fun and incresingly challenging, learning curve
      is adequate, music/sound is wonderful and so are the minimalistic graphics.
      It''s a relaxing yet fun experience.


      Keep in mind that this is a mobile port, though. It''s relatively simple and
      it''s designed to be played with 2 fingers.


      ---------------------------------------------------------------------


      It''s been a few years and it''s still entertaining to get in and play a daily
      challenge every now and then. Like, considering the type of arcade simple game
      that it is, the gameplay loop is surprisingly amusing and the game overall feels
      polished and smooth.'
