It seems it needs to be used in connection with the actual game somehow.  Maybe it gave me extra music while playing the game?  I don't know.  I don't even know if I've been able to listen to the soundtrack.  I thought when I bought it that I could download some music.  That doesn't seem to be the case.","timestamp_created":1560418217,"timestamp_updated":1560418217,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wo2LqOsCc4OpwwE="}
