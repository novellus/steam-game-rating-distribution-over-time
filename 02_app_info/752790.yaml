    review: 'This game does not work for me, already when booting it up the developer
      intro has like 15fps, when I skip it the menu seems to be working fine, as soon
      as I start the game up the fps drop from 60 and above to 1-5, this makes the
      intro sequence pretty much infinitely long and the game unplayable. I''ve checked
      the task manager but everything seems to be normal. I''ve also tried multiple
      compatibility modes but none worked.


      I am going to request a refund from steam, but I''d be happy to buy the game
      again once the issues have been resolved.'
