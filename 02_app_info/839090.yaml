    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><u>Galaxy Defender</u></h2>Listen here defender,
      it is your job to fight off incoming drones inside a narrow glass corridor floating
      through space. Destroy the waves of drones by hitting space balls at them using
      your futuristic space wands. Rack up enough kills using the same ball will create
      a power up for an instant smash. Gain points for destroying drones and enough
      points will spawn more balls for more destruction. Good luck defender the galaxy's
      or more like your glass corridor's fate awaits.<h2 class="bb_tag"><u>Gameplay</u></h2>The
      objective of the game is to achieve a high score by destroying as many drones
      as possible by hitting them with balls. Each match you start with one normal
      red ball. After accumulating enough score the game will spawn another ball that
      you can use as well. If a ball destroys 3 drones it will get a power up and
      start to glow. The next drone it hits it will instantly destroy. The balls get
      destroyed if they fly passed the player into the purple void. Drones come in
      4 levels signified by their color. Level 1 drones are blue, level 2 are cyan,
      level 3 are green and level 4 are purple. Each level takes that many hits to
      destroy so level 1 is 1 hit and level 2 is 2 hits and so on. The drones spawn
      in waves of 1 to 5 every 3 seconds based on length of round. The game ends if
      the drones get too close to the player or the player runs out of balls.

    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      There are so many racquet / brickbreaker games in VR. Racket NX and Holoball\
      \ are still the kings of this subgenre. Galaxy Ball Defender, unfortunately,\
      \ is near the bottom. \n\nHere is my list from personal experience:\n\n1. Racket\
      \ NX\n2. Holoball\n3. Plannes\n4. Duo\n5. Arcade Saga\n6. Ready Player One (Smash\
      \ & Fracture) * FREE\n7. Proton Pulse\n8. Slum ball VR * FREE\n9. Magical Squash\n\
      10. Pingball\n11. Galaxy Ball Defender\n12. Not even woth mentioning games this\
      \ bad (note: did not include tennis/ badminton / pure racquetball games or ping\
      \ pong) ** Never played Super Pixel Smash, but it looks good **\n\nSo why is\
      \ Galaxy Ball Defender so low on the list? Well, the ball physics are off. Hitting\
      \ the ball would lead to often strange results. You can control the general\
      \ direction where the ball goes if you hit it well, but that's it. Several times\
      \ the ball would go up and down the corridor as though I had hit a foul ball.\
      \ I think part of the problem is the paddle. It's like a thin baseball bat.\
      \ Not good for this type of objective game. Easy to mishit and generally impossible\
      \ to be precise. \n\nThere's only one game mode. You lose and you start back\
      \ to zero. There's local leaderboard only. Only 1 boring and simplistic environment.\
      \ The rules are not explained. It said to press grip to bring ball back to you,\
      \ but that never worked on the Oculus Rift. Extra balls spawned, but I had no\
      \ idea why. Different shapes and colors. Not sure what they did. Sometimes I\
      \ lost and wasn't sure why. Is there a certain distance the drones can get to\
      \ before you lose? They didn't seem that close. Who knows. Nothing explained.\n\
      \nRate 4/10. It was only $2 on the Steam summer sale, I played only 10 minutes.\
      \ It's probably something I'll never play again without major updates. But I\
      \ won't refund. It's not the worst game, just compared to other racket games\
      \ it's pretty dull."
