      gameplay. No rogue elements, no random content, everything is handcrafted and
      deliberately designed. Backtracking is not a dirty word.</strong><br><br>Based
      on the comic book of the same name, <strong>BioMech</strong> casts you as <strong>Tatiana
      Rocheva</strong>, a Russian soldier who served her country in Iraq.<br>After
      being captured and tortured, she was outfitted with enhanced cybernetic limbs
      giving her inhuman strength and speed.<br>Now, Tatiana is being sent on her
