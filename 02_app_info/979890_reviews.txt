The graphics are ugly, it's full of jump scares, it's not fun, movement is very slow, you can't run, it's super boring. If you die, you start at the beginning of the level, btw. enemies kill you in one hit. Also just one hour long. \nStay away from this one.","timestamp_created":1608918624,"timestamp_updated":1608918624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8LzBzfYCfJuPvQI="}
