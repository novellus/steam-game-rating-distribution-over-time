In a good way.\nYou get into the game, and the first couple of levels you're sitting back on you're chair, thinking this is a pretty chill, but somewhat simple game. The more you proceed to the next levels, the more \"game mode\" you sit on your chair, things get hard. Quick. The complexity of the game shows to be much more than expected, you need to think of which route to take, when to jump, a second earlier or late and game over. This game is seriously amazing, with a nostalgic sense and feel with the overall look, but the complexity and overall enjoyment of other great games out there.\nFor 2,99â‚¬, you'll enjoy this game much more than you'd ever expect.","timestamp_created":1592158509,"timestamp_updated":1592158657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nqOD2vICc62FjgI="}
