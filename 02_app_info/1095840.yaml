    review: 'I gave this a thumbs up, because it''s a decently made solitaire game.
      And for about 6 or 7 hours, it''s fun. But I''d also like to give it a thumbs
      down, because it quickly becomes boring...VERY boring. It''s as repetitive as
      heck. And although there are in-game achievements, there are NO Steam achievements
      to give incentive to play thru to the end. I''ve played for over 10 hours, and
      I see no end to this tiring repetition.


      I would only recommend this to people who are crazy about card solitaire, and
      ONLY when it''s marked down cheap. You''ll get SOME fun out of it. Then you''ll
      do what I am doing, and uninstall it well before you''re done.'
