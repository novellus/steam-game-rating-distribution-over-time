    review: 'I liked it. It took politics and a murder mystery and actually made it
      engaging with the use of a mini game of high vs low numbers. Didn''t love the
      PC being a crying lovesick mess out the gate, but luckily didn''t have to deal
      with it much.


      I actually did really well at the mini game. And then I died a horrible death
      XD I may try it again someday, but once through was enough for now.'
