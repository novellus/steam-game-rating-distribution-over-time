    review: "Great game, especially enjoyed the reloading mechanic and the fact that\
      \ you can throw enemies' grenades back at them. \n\nHowever, I completed it\
      \ in 22 minutes, which would be okay for a free demo, but not for a full game\
      \ (or episode, in this case). There is no mention on the store page whether\
      \ the next episodes are included in the price or not.\n\nIf the price was a\
      \ tenth of what it is I would have kept it.\n\nAsked for a refund, but It'll\
      \ stay on my wishlist and I'll re-purchase it when and if all episodes are released\
      \ and a bundle is on offer."
