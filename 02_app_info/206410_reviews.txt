I loved it so much that when I saw it on Steam I had to buy it and relive my childhood. It's such a good Rube Goldberg puzzle game. The elements can be wacky and the overal experience is great. I would recomend it to anyone who likes Rube Golderg machines and tricky puzzles.","timestamp_created":1594568428,"timestamp_updated":1594568428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnunrofMCcMHqlAI="}
