    about_the_game: Puzzle in the RETROWAVE style, where you have to solve complex
      and difficult tasks in order to move the hexagons so that they all fall into
      the luminous places on the level. Hexagons can move in one direction and move
      other hexagons, they can not move at all, they can jump over cells, and they
      can move in two directions at once. All this creates many combinations of solutions,
      among which you must find the right ones. Sometimes levels will throw you really
      hard puzzles, but everything can be solved. And RETROWAVE helps. Many pleasant
      tracks will calm you down while you concentrate on solving problems. And in
      total 100 levels are waiting for you. Can you master them all?
