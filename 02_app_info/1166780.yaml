    review: 'This is a wafer thin but somewhat entertaining concept. For the price,
      it''s still worth getting and encouraging development of these sorts of games.


      Yes it has a bit of Stanley Parable/Portal to it. But it is largely one level
      done five times with minor variations. It doesn''t really evolve and I never
      felt that compelled to move on. There are a couple of small puzzles, but largely
      it''s a walking simulator. (I love walking simulators, so that''s a good thing.)


      But it''s so cheap... I found it quite interesting and I want more of this sort
      of experience. So that''s why I put it in the recommended column and would be
      interested in more from this developer in the future.
