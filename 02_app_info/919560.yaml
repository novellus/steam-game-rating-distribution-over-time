    review: '[b]Monster Farm[/b] is an idle casual game where you earn coins by your
      monsters.

      You upgrade your monster by matching two to become a better monster.


      For all the achievement hunters out there, it is a must play game because it
      has a fair amount of achievement that can be easily unlocked. I left a few guides
      in order to help as I saw that there was not even one.


      However, I must say that the game is dead and the only purpose is for its achievements.


      Overall, it is recommend if you want to get some easy 100% achievements.'
