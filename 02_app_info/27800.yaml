    review: Psychedelic retro joy from game-making maniac Jeff Minter. Wondrous sights,
      sounds, and music await you as you clear web after web of abstract monsters,
      flowers, and bullets. The visuals go out of their way to overwhelm you, but
      with practice, you'll find yourself adapting to the insanity and recognizing
      threats by mere sound and motion. A truly unique experience that no arcade-lover
      should miss.
