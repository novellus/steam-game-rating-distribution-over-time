Equally important the sniper rifle load out is very good too.\n\nBlack Hawk Down's single player missions for a sniper. There are a total of sixteen missions set during the Somalia Civil War of the 1990s. (The game is a homage to the film of the same name). At the start of every mission the player will be briefed on what the objective is. Missions objectives range from neutralizing the terrorist in a town, to assassinating Mohammed Farrah Aidid. For all the missions the player can choose a sniper rifle for their primary weapon. Most of the single player missions are based on true events, that is what gives this game a little more respect. Also there is nothing more satisfying that being a Delta Force sniper landing in the L.Z in a Black Hawk helicopter. \n\nBlack Hawk Down's sniper rifles, sidearms and other accessories. There are a total of five sniper rifles in the game. M24, M21, Barrett M82, PSG-1 and a McMillian MCRT (which looks like the M24). The M24 is my favourite, I pretty much played all the single player missions with this sniper rifle the first time. My only negative critique of the sniper rifle is that all five sniper rifles have the same cross hairs. The sniper rifle can be chosen for the primary weapon, for the player's secondary weapon, a sidearm is available. Only two hand guns are available; the M9 Beretta and the Colt M1911 (this is too do with the realism of trying to keep it P.C wit the Delta Force of the 1990s). As for accessories, there are two types of grenades; frag and smoke. There are also rocket launchers and even a claymore, if that is your thing. \n\nSo if you are a gamer who wants to be a Delta Force sniper, and land in a Black Hawk helicopter in the war zone in Somalia. Then Black Hawk Down is for you! Just try not to pay attention to the budget graphics. For example, the enemy A.I is the same character mod.","timestamp_created":1610074324,"timestamp_updated":1610076429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rJOC8PYCd5+4wQI="}
