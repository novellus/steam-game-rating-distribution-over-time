That honor belongs to Sonic 2, another amazing game. But it is my favorite. On a technical level, the game pushes the Genesis to its absolute limit, and the gameplay is a fun mix of speed and platforming action. Sonic 3 & Knuckles is the single greatest Sonic game. But its legacy is slowly being forgotten, as legal issues have made this Sonic 3 & Knuckles' last release. So I urge you to purchase this masterpiece of a game as soon as you can, because it might not be here forever.","timestamp_created":1597945858,"timestamp_updated":1597945858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566666662693023682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/di/hvQCdbzWnAI="}
