It's difficult to make everything work, but it doesn't feel difficult, and if you meet the fail condition, doesn't force you to restart. Just asks if you want to restart or if you'd like to keep playing in Endless or Creative. Challenges for each level of which, again, there are many. Controls are simple and easy to learn. Even has a night mode.\n\nOnly real downside is that some colors are too similar to each other, which might make it hard to keep track of your rails.\n\nOtherwise, if you're into something that will kill time, this will certainly do it. Got it on sale, but it's probably worth full price.","timestamp_created":1609904912,"timestamp_updated":1609904912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6O7z6vYCcYzzwAI="}
