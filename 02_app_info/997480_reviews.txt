Actually, it sounds pretty good when you just want to relax and not care about real life that much.  The graphics/music/SFX are pretty.  You can even set the background as your own desktop!\n\nApparently this was the third game, but you can play them out of order (I think... Or just play them and put the story line together in the end).  In this one you first rebuild the kingdom... and then you save it!  The knights/warriors said they will fight for you, but you do all the work.  Why?  Because you got magic and they can only melee upfront and the enemies are too scary for that kind of tactic.\n\nThere are cut scenes too.  Didn't expect that one, but it was cool.  Alright, so obviously you play Solitaire games the entire time, but to switch it up you get different... \"Quests\" (Let's just go with that).  Sometimes you gotta buy buildings or make a relic (they are just for looking at, but they are pretty) and of course you gotta fight those pesky enemies!\n\nDo you have to clear the board like in many other Solitaire games?  Well, remember I said this is for a more relaxing game play?  I meant it.  You don't have to.  Unless you want extra gold (for building levels) and/or a perfectionist... then that's up to you.  As long as you find what they tell ya (There is also a hint button if you feel even lazier.  :) ), then you are good to go.  I would have wanted the gold goals to be higher and even the \"Quest\" items to go up in number the higher you climb in levels... but I wasn't bored and wasn't pressured, so they did things right.\n\nAbout bugs... (No game is perfect okay!) if you find a key to unlock the chains or an axe (I think I only got one single axe level though), DO NOT PRESS THE UNDO BUTTON.  DON'T DO IT.  You will never ever open the chains/leaves ever, ever again!  Also, they might glitch on their own (which rarely happens) and sometimes your \"helping tools\" (the ones above your cards, like the sword) refuse to take a card out, but that's also rare... but it happens.  Just be wary.  Don't panic!  Either go on or hit the restart button.\n\nSo overall, if you are a quick player: you will fly through this game.  If you take it easy and just steadily enjoy it, you will get things out of it.  However, you be the judge if you should play the game or not.  I am not going to tell you to enjoy it.  :>\n\nThank you for the relaxing, fun and semi-challenging game!!! :) :> =)","timestamp_created":1606076923,"timestamp_updated":1606076923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x5/p+PUCd6n5rwI="}
