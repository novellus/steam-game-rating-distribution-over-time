    review: "What kind of game is this? Not a gem, not by a long shot, but there are\
      \ some good things here.\n\nThe sparse tags may be a little misleading, but\
      \ this is actually a rogue-lite game. Death is basically your save mechanism.\
      \ You're expected to die and you'll do it a lot, and that's okay. When you die\
      \ you keep your money and experience gained, so even repeated garbage runs in\
      \ the first floor aren't really a waste; you can take the time you need to get\
      \ the hang of it (Not that there's much of a learning curve, more like picking\
      \ up on the game's little idiosyncracies over a few play sessions)\n\n The game\
      \ employs a perk-tree system spread across three distinct playstyles, namely\
      \ an assault marine with big guns, a nimbler \"assassin\" with higher mobility\
      \ and lighter weapons, and a specialist that uses the game's more unusual weapons\
      \ more effectively. In terms of the gameplay mechanics, it's not that adventurous\
      \ but that's probably a good thing. There's at least some fundamental design\
      \ principles at work here.\n\nOnce you're in the main part of the game, that's\
      \ where the issues start to arise. You move at a pace that's slow enough that\
      \ I'm pretty sure the character's feet are sliding on the floor, which also\
      \ highlights some less-than-perfect animations. Frankly, not a dealbreaker for\
      \ what's obviously an indie title who's development staff can likely be counted\
      \ on one hand. My biggest gripe has to be the frankly broken reload, which is\
      \ far too slow and seems unresponsive at times, with those times often while\
      \ you're being sprayed in the face with flames or pelted with enough plasma\
      \ balls to put this game into bullet-hell territory.\n\nInterestingly the slow\
      \ movement speed and the erratic weapon spread are somewhat intentional, as\
      \ the perk system does allow you to mitigate the damage and move more quickly\
      \ with appropriate perk choices. Nothing fixes the reloading mechanic though.\n\
      \nThe second thing is the weapon system, which divides the game's 50 or so guns\
      \ across several categories. Weapons in the same category share a common ammo\
      \ pool, so bringing two pistols or two assault rifles is a mistake; you'll want\
      \ to diversify. (Amusingly, most of the guns are simply renamed real-world weapons.\
      \ The starting assault rifle is an AK, for example. The game's more unique weapons\
      \ are in the special category, including a rather satisfying laser rifle)\n\n\
      Where the game shines is once you start getting into it a little, and you start\
      \ enjoying the destruction on screen. Explosions occur with EVERYTHING, which\
      \ is itself a hazard and a tactical boon to you if used right. There are few\
      \ things more satisfying that clearing a room with one well-placed grenade,\
      \ with said room exploding in a cascade so furious your computer seems to fail\
      \ to translate that into audio. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having a little\
      \ fun playing this game.\n\nOverall, none of the problems it has really compromise\
      \ its core design, so I'd say give it a try if you've got a dollar to spend.\
      \ If you're into other twin-stick-schmup games like Alien Shooter you'll feel\
      \ right at home."
