The DLC is worth it for that song alone.\n\nWhen I was a child, my mother used to sing me \"Country Roads\" as a lullaby. The way she sang it, it carried the feelings of adventure, of longing, of missing home more than actual words ever could.\nWhen the vocals at the end of \"Marinera\" came up in the game, I pretty much burst into tears and had to think of those lullabies from all those years ago.","timestamp_created":1601671648,"timestamp_updated":1601671648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550714790821075439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsLrE9fQCf6+8pQI="}
