It is okay game but I would not recommend it to buy it for longer play. Multiplayer only works on the same network too(local network multiplayer), so you need something like Hamachi. Game has a lot of desync but there is no problem if you are doing coop playthrough. It is short with not too many levels, so it gets boring after some time. \nIf it was still supported and not the Abandonware I could fully recommend it as it has potential.","timestamp_created":1605737142,"timestamp_updated":1605737258,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwcPZ7vUCeJGZrwI="}
