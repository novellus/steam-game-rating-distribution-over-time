    review: '35 dollars for 6 characters, who they are charging 7 dollars a piece
      for. The only value of the season pass is its a buy 5 get one free. Furthermore
      it doesn''t include any of those characters colors, stages, and now it also
      doesn''t include an absolutely scummy season pass which you will also have to
      pay for if you want some of the colors or cosmetics for these characters.


      Absolutely disgusting business practices.'
