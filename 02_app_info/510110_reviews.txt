It does its job well; it just doesn’t do anything else beyond that.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nOne of the most defining elements of the first New Yankee game was its pace. Since we had many workers to gather food, wood, gold, and mana, there was not a moment of downtime on any level. This sequel tries to follow a similar vein but still attempts to tone down the speed somewhat.\n\nThe worker count is up to nine now, but we can only receive resources from production buildings when we assign a worker to them. Also, the levels are closer to little puzzles, where we must follow an intended order and timing to stand a chance beating the countdown clock.\n\nAs a result, we get a time manager that is both fast yet still methodical. Trial and error is a large part of playing New Yankee 2… although some may say that it is a too large part of the game. Those, however, who enjoy puzzle-ish time managers, will love this one.\n\nAs usual in this genre, there is barely any story; it is mostly pre-level banter among the many characters. Although I have to admit, seeing the big, burly protagonist cover in her from his wife has a few funny moments.","timestamp_created":1583914526,"timestamp_updated":1583914526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655211508274078369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw07Sq5PACcOqx9wE="}
