      Purchases</strong> : To support development, there will be items made available
      for purchase within the game, but they will never be offered to gain an advantage
      over others. For example, you are able to purchase skins and weapons with the
      in-game currency &quot;Coins&quot; for use immediately, however you can also
      unlock each and every weapon/skin from leveling up. So it is up to you, the
      player, if you wish to grind it out, or support the developers and get to use
      a specific weapon/wear a specific skin without waiting.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/394380/extras/weapons.png?t=1599732875"
