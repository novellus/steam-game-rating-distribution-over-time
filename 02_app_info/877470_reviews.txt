The music didn't help like you need to be pumped up but it just felt like some royalty free midi \"creepy town\" music or whatever. Not saying it was but that's what it felt like.\n\nI've been playing a lot of doom recently so one thing that really stands out is how sluggish and clunky the movement is. \nAlso I'm not sure if it's a sprite issue or what but I noticed enemies would get stuck together and be unable to move. The enemies in general at least as far as I could be bothered to play didn't have a ranged attack so it was just kinda dull kiting them and either killing them or just walking past. Like there were a couple of pumpkin men with guns but mostly just not.\n\nLike it's not total garbage or anything but it's just kinda a worse version of games from like 30 years ago and I don't really see any reason to play it unless the idea of a pumpkin in a toilet is your idea of peak humour or something.","timestamp_created":1559655007,"timestamp_updated":1559655007,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577990889549255371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sdirkesCcKTdwgE="}
