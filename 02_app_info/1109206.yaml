      \ American railroads was ordered by Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific, the\
      \ planned 256H-series power plant was both delayed in production and then proved\
      \ unpopular. As a result, only 68 6,000-horsepower SD90MACs were constructed.\
      \ In what was first intended as an interim solution, but which proven permanent,\
      \ EMD instead constructed 410 of its 90-series locomotives with 4,300-horsepower\

      \ the 6,000-horsepower SD90MACs proved to have a short service life, the SD9043MACs\
      \ have gone on to serve extended careers. Union Pacific rostered the largest\
      \ SD9043MACs fleet at 309 units and while most UP units have now been retired,\
      \ many SD9043MACs remain in service with second-hand owners, either in as-built\

    review: Just picked this one up today with it on a special promotion sale and
      I have to say this is a very good locomotive with very bright headlights and
      you can open the windows and here the sounds of the loco even more inside the
      cab and the breaks are very good as well.
