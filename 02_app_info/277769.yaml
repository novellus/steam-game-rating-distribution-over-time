    about_the_game: "One of the most powerful single-engine diesel locomotives in\
      \ the World comes to Train Simulator, the General Electric AC6000CW.<br><br>The\
      \ 1990s saw a huge horsepower race between North America\u2019s two major locomotive\
      \ manufacturers, GE Transportation and Electro-Motive, both keen to harness\
      \ an anticipated demand from the railroads for high-powered freight movers.\
      \ The results were the AC6000CW from GE and SD90MAC from EMD \u2013 both 6,000hp\
      \ models.<br><br>Between 1995 and 2001, a total of 314 AC6000CW locomotives\
      \ (in two variants) were constructed for CSX and Union Pacific in the US, and\
      \ BHP Billiton in Australia. To achieve 6,000hp in a single-power-plant unit,\
      \ GE collaborated with Deutz MWM of Germany to develop a new engine, the 7HDL16.\
      \ Due to an eventual lack of demand for units of this size and the subsequent\
      \ development of the more efficient and reliable GEVO power plant, the AC6000CW\
      \ was the only significant rail application of the 7HDL-series power plant.<br><br>The\
      \ AC6000CW packed considerable specifications when it entered service \u2013\
      \ units measured 76ft in length and weighed 425 tons. The locomotives are noted\
      \ for their North American wide-nose cab styling, massive 5,500-gallon fuel\
      \ tank, and huge rear \u2018flared\u2019 radiators unique to this GE locomotive.\
      \ A total of 207 7HDL-powered AC6000CWs were built. Additionally, to hurry the\
      \ model to market, GE built 106 locomotives for Union Pacific with GE\u2019\
      s standard 7FDL engine rated for 4,400hp, which were intended to be converted\
      \ to the more powerful engine, but this re-powering program never materialised.<br><br>The\

    review: I got this on the Fall sale knowing the wheel slip problems this thing
      had. Well, I have since solve that problem. I noticed the engine is very wheel
      slip happy, and when you apply sand it only does the front truck. You think
      that would be no problem, but then it starts acting up again. This time I switched
      on the second sand button in the cab for both trucks, and I've been down to
      10 mph 100% no wheel slip, which by that point you were too far gone spinning
      you had to restart. I was always a big fan of the "Big Six" and so far it has
      been that one child who behaves half the time, but you still love them.
