    review: Simply put, Space Cat is a fun and challenging NES-inspired, Arcade-Style
      platformer. It's filled with variety, charm, and challenge all mixed together
      just right. The soundtrack is also stellar and I find myself listening to it
      still on occasion. One thing I personally had trouble with was the keyboard
      controls. They are personally uncomfortable to me, so I would highly suggest
      using a controller for this game. With a new update having just recently launched,
      adding a bunch of new, quality, content, I'd say now is better than ever to
      pick up this game, especially for $5.
