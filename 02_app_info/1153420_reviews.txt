I appreciate the hand drawn feel.\n\nI love the characters. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the Chibi style, and these are the complete opposite. My problem is that I can't find any other character sets that match up to these. Sadly, I may have to suck it up and get creative with the included templates.\n\nIt's a bit pricey, but so is everything else for RPG Maker :)","timestamp_created":1578806156,"timestamp_updated":1578806156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrsOLzO8Cd/G66wE="}
