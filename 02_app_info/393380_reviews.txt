Have been wanting to play it for a very long time and finally have the opportunity. has a very steep learning curve and even only 30 hours in, still trying to learn how to do everything properly. Community is very good and for the most part very helpful and understanding, of course there is the occasional exception. Cannot wait for the developers to add even more factions. Hopefully they can come up with a way to factor in proper Fire Support bases, the ability to knock over and cut down trees with explosives and impacts from heavy vehicles would be nice too, maybe even being able to add mouse holes in walls etc to make better firing positions, battle scarring would also be much appreciated, being able to use the ground as cover after an air strike or artillery strike etc. But the game is still in early development, overall I'm really impressed with it and it would have to be one of my favourite games.","timestamp_created":1609855777,"timestamp_updated":1609855777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jre46fYCf93awAI="}
