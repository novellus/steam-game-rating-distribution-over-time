    review: Certainly not worth 10 bucks, but then again, neither are the other VR
      sushi games, and they all look identical. This one actually looks pretty good
      in comparison and doesn't seem to use as many canned assets. Should easily compete
      with the 3 copies of Counter Fight being sold. Wait for it to drop to 5$ I suppose,
      but if you already have one of the other sushi games, I say cheeze it. [spoiler]I
      tried sharp white cheddar cheeze its today, yuck. [/spoiler] https://youtu.be/0F6PpOrQ7lw
