Strato's Sylph Asterism caught my attention when I was browsing the shoot 'em ups tag since I'm always interested in less conventional shmups, but ultimately didn't feel very interesting or enjoyable.\n\nThe controls are simple: you fly around with the WASD keys, aim and fire your primary and secondary weapons with the mouse, and have a few additional keys for dodging, melee, and reloading.\n\nFirst, you cannot aim at all while moving. You can fire, but you only do so exactly straight ahead. This feels strange and unintuitive, and also means you are generally either moving or firing, even if the enemy you're firing at is in the general area in front of you. Additionally, you cannot smoothly transition from a dodge into any other action. It locks your direction, prevents you from firing, and even drains some of your momentum. Furthermore, you cannot dodge or attack (obviously) while reloading. Many of the actions lack smooth interaction with other actions, and since none of these maneuvers have much technical or tactical depth, the gameplay feels stiff rather than deliberate. It simply was not that interesting to be on the offensive or defensive, and there was no real way to combine the two into a more skillful playstyle. There's just nothing to the gameplay to make it satisfying.\n\nThere's not much game to experience the gameplay with anyways. You get five levels, but only two of them (levels four and five) are interesting. As far as I can tell there are no additional difficulties, so those five levels are it. The first level even has a tutorial built in that must be played each time you replay that level, hurting replayability even more. Like the gameplay, there's just nothing here. You can choose a different character on some levels, but they aren't distinct enough to be interesting.\n\nThis game doesn't really seem unpolished on an overt level, but it certainly is unpolished in more abstract, intangible ways. Lack of mechanical fluidity, lack of interesting level design, lack of technical depth, lack of content. Not bad, perhaps, due to the presence of bad elements, but due to the lack of good ones.\n\nI don't recommend this game. It's boring. Its levels are uninteresting, and its gameplay isn't fluid or technical enough to engage. I certainly don't recommend it for $15 USD, and I'm honestly not sure what price I would recommend it for.","timestamp_created":1593215886,"timestamp_updated":1593215886,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513513505458831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq6TE+fICdNrEkAI="}
