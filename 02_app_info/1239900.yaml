    developer_response: "Thank you for posting your first review of my game!\n\nDodge\
      \ skill invincible time can be changed using skill points.\nThe default is 0.2\
      \ seconds and is very short time invincible\nIf you press P during the game\
      \ to assign points to \"Dodge Skill Upgrade\" in \"IDENTITY,\" the invincible\
      \ time is extended.\n\nReduced the percentage of zombies that only long distance\
      \ attack\n\nWhen a character takes damage and health reaches 0, the character\
      \ dies.\nAt this time, if the health item is in use, the health will rise slightly\
      \ from 0.\nDeactivated the health item upon death.\n\nVending machines are on\
      \ the -1, 45, 49, 63, 80, 81 (central area), 87, 90, 93, 106, Defense Mode maps.\n\
      The word \"Store\" has been added to the top of the vending machine.\n\nThe\
      \ area where zombies spawn indefinitely is an area used when there is a shortage\
      \ of accessory upgrade materials.\nRunning over the area too fast can make it\
      \ difficult to class Up the accessories.\n\nThe automatic acquisition of items\
      \ has been activated.\n\nGrenades are made to stun and spread monsters around.\n\
      The grenade stun time has been increased to 10 seconds to better suit the concept.\n\
      \nThe problem with the focus of the widget is a bug where the direction keys\
      \ in the direction of movement are not released.\nexit the widget, click on\
      \ the game screen, and press the direction key in the direction you are moving,\
      \ it will be resolved.\n(The bug has been resolved.)\n\nI apologize for any\
      \ inconvenience.\nIf you find the gaming system inconvenient or boring, I would\
      \ appreciate it if you let me know :)\n\n\n\uC81C \uAC8C\uC784\uC5D0 \uCCAB\

    review: "When you play this kind of Zombie game, you must be expecting to kill\
      \ bunch of the zombies, chasing you, with guns.\nBut is this game, Zombies spit\
      \ some projectiles like blood shit to you from distance, making you busy dodging.\n\
      In the story mode, you will find some invisible walls that prevents you from\
      \ crossing some places until you do the exact thing that has been told. Seriously?\
      \ Well may be I've expected too much. But really, nowhere to find ammo until\
      \ may be certain point? cause I've never seen one after the first floor! I could\
      \ not clear through the zombies because of the short of ammo, WTF? You could\
      \ have given us great experience, but this, is disappointment. And seriously,\
      \ why press F to pick up ingots? they are just money, aren't they? They just\
      \ get all mixed up this background and hard to find, and you need to recycle\
      \ in in the inventory to make money? what were you thinking?!\n\n\uC880\uBE44\
