Seems difficult at start but once it clicks the flight model is very intuitive. A more focused space experience which is truly unique in its genre. I am already trading and building my fleets while interacting with the universe around me. The backdrop to all this is a hard sci-fi one which feels more realistic than a lot of the fantasy settings we see. Reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey in many ways. A complete game also which is rather cool in the age of never ending early access! I would really like to see more games like this or a sequel!","timestamp_created":1609161405,"timestamp_updated":1609161405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pM7f1PYCdsaMvgI="}
