I was under the impression I had the choice between mp3, FLAC, etc. which entails ability to find the files and DL them. I definitely bought both the game and the OST, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nSoundtrack is beyond amazing in-game though which is why I want it so bad. I would really love to listen to this at work to boost productivity lol.","timestamp_created":1508396815,"timestamp_updated":1508396815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qZrdmd8Ce5vZiAE="}
