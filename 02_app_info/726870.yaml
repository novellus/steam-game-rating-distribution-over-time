    review: "I love interactive fiction and was pleasantly surprised to see this 'remaster'\
      \ on Steam. Quite a bit (from what I remember, but it's been a loooong time)\
      \ has been changed, pretty much all of it for the better.\n\nUsually when you\
      \ play a game like this, it's hard to get all the puzzle pieces to fit and make\
      \ a place seem like more than just an inventory hunt. This game definitely doesn't\
      \ fall into that common trap. It's 'oldschool', harkening to ye olde Zork days,\
      \ but does so with eldritchian glee. \n\nDefinitely a step up from Lurking Horror--\
      \ actually, it might be the best horror IF out there?"
