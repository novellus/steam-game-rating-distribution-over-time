This title follows the adventures of the swashbuckling Captain Firebeard and his band of pirates as they attempt to pull off one of the biggest heists in all of history. Prepare to set sails for a thrilling escapade ripe with dangerous combat, dubious encounters and bountiful riches to be accquired as you attempt to make Captain Firebeard the king of all pirates...Blackbeard be darned!!!\n\n[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]\n\nThis visual novel has a fantastic presentation that includes some beautiful artwork on the characters and backgrounds throughout the story. The illustrations are filled with bright eyecatching colors and shading. Also, the characters change facial expressions depending on their current mood so that really helps with immersion although I must admit that there is a lack of ambient sound effects which, on the other hand, hinders immersion. One very noteworthy aspect of this V.N. is the inclusion of a very fun minigame that you play in order to accomplish various goals during the story such as sneaking into an armory to pillage weapons or assaulting a military compound. The minigame itself plays much like \"Pac Man\" if I had to compare it to anything. By replacing Pac Man with Captain Firebeard and the ghosts with enemy soldiers this is the basic framework of said minigame. \n\nYour objective is to collect a certain amount of coins scattered across the map while avoiding death at the hands of the cutlass wielding patrolling soldiers. There are a couple of cutlasses laying about which once accquired by Firebeard gives him the chance to kill the soldiers for a small amount of time. It's a very simple game but still quite entertaining nonetheless and it also adds a nice bit of gameplay to the visual novels narrative which is always a welcome addition in my opinion. The dialogue is also brilliantly voiced as the actors do a fantastic and highly believable job of capturing the spirit of this V.N.. The soundtrack is excellent and fits in well with the story and really kept to the overall pirate and caribbean theme. In summary, this wonderfully stylized novel takes you on quite a fascinating adventure from start to finish. \n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\nI'm a big fan of pirates and adventure so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I truly enjoyed this visual novel because at first glance I was expecting it to be merely okay yet it turned out to be a much more enjoyable experience than I had anticipated. The story is engaging, the characters are very memorable, Captain Firebeard is hilarious and the inclusion of the minigame is a fantastic compliment to the wonderful narrative. As options go, there are a small amount of Steam Achievements to hunt down but sadly no Steam Trading Cards to collect. The basic visual novel settings for sound/volume control and text speed are present. Also, there is D.L.C. in the form of an orchestral soundtrack and \"The Curse Of The Golden Crab\" which tells an extended new story with one of the members of Captain Firebeards crew. In conclusion, Captain Firebeard And The Bay Of Crows was a thrilling adventure that any fan of the visual novel genre would be proud to be a part of so this title is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","timestamp_created":1532257430,"timestamp_updated":1532257430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.749967634677886963","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn53q4OQCcozPpgE="}
