As it stands, there is one, and only one game mechanic - use your right hand to jet around an area and shoot at red walls using your left hand, while avoiding the random things flying at you or blasting them. The only variety comes in the layout of the levels.\n\nThis description I just gave is literally the whole game. Half an hour in, and I had every achievement unlocked, and no desire to play the other 5 levels given there was every indication they'd be as repetitive as the first 5.\n\nI think this title needs to cook for a great deal longer - you can do a lot better for your $10.","timestamp_created":1482102393,"timestamp_updated":1482284574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613073825836181641","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0/TCj9kCeKbHbA=="}
