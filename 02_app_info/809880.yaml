      /><br><br>Degrees of Separation is a 2D puzzle-adventure game that requires
      players to harness the elements of heat and cold to succeed. Two contrasting
      souls, Ember and Rime, are separated by an enigmatic force, and must use their
      respective powers to progress through a spectacular world of fantasy and adventure.
      Players take on the roles of Ember and Rime in single-player and cooperative
      multiplayer to solve the game's environmental obstacles, drawing on their unique
      skills to traverse through beautiful, puzzle-filled environments. The two will
      learn to lean on one another, their individual forces working to bring them
      closer together...or tear them apart.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/809880/extras/Degrees-Steam-Key-Features-Header-White.png?t=1574364830"
