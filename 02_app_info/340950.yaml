    review: "This was the first of two games produced by this company... http://www.backwardpies.com/\n\
      \nIt\u2019s a Zen like, relaxing, build a tree game. Your trees must provide\
      \ cover for mushrooms on the ground, while at the same time avoid blocking sunlight\
      \ for all the flowers. It's aimed predominantly for children and adults to play\
      \ together. Problem is that there really isn't much on offer here and you will\
      \ probably be bored with it within an hour or so. This isn't to say it isn't\
      \ enjoyable to play, it is, but there isn't really anything challenging here.\n\
      \nThe hand painted art is very stylish and the sounds of children laughing and\
      \ the gorgeous accompanying music will often inspire a smile. There is a number\
      \ of animated birds and butterflies which also help you become at peace as they\
      \ brighten up your tree and make it come to life with all their fluttering\u2019\
      s and noises.\n\n34 levels, but they all follow practically the same principle,\
      \ after you have done the first couple you can literally jump to the last level\
      \ and pass it easily. You will then be given a key to open a door and credits\
      \ roll, the end. This game is like another one I have played and if you enjoy\
      \ this, then you would definitely enjoy 'Reach for the Sun' also available on\
      \ Steam but has a bit more to offer in the way of a challenge than it does content.\
      \ Because of the lack of playability on offer here I would honestly recommend\
      \ to wait for a sale. Normal price seems way overpriced simply on the basis\
      \ that there are a LOT of better games on offer that go rather cheap on Steam.\n\
      \nTips for developer...\n* You like to make informative games (your web page\
      \ says) but there isn't anything informative here other than flowers like sunlight\
      \ and mushrooms like shade. Maybe add a section where you unlock an information\
      \ card with each tree you successfully grow as it would encourage the gamers\
      \ to try each tree.\n* Steam achievements would be a plus even for an easy game\
      \ like this.\n* It would have been interesting if the tree had to attend to\
      \ the wildlife as well. Rebuild nests. Feed. Water.\n* Seasonal mechanics would\
      \ have been an interesting way to teach children as well such as rain, snow,\
      \ and intense heat, autumn.\n* Trading Cards, would really like some backgrounds\
      \ for my steam profile of this game as the pictures are so relaxing to look\
      \ at.\n\nIn final a game all about making a connection, but due to its simplicity\
      \ you may wish for a summer sale...\n\nBelow is me playing the game first few\
      \ levels, then showing you the last one...\nhttps://youtu.be/wJJCvwC3WBg\n\n\
      \nIf you enjoyed reading this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page.\
      \ Thanks...\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6843548/"
