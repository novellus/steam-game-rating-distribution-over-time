    about_the_game: You play as a bold ball that needs to run through all the hi-tech
      security systems. Bumping into the security bots means death, same does a fall
      from too high. Collect health points and look for finish blocks to go to the
      next level. In this game you just need get to the end of the level and avoid
      collisions with dangerous enemies. Some places can not be passed without using
      the special ability of the ball - to draw lines in the air. These lines will
      help the hero to move around the map more freely, climb in high places, or create
      an obstacle for moving deadly traps. But use this ability wisely, as the paint
      supply is limited.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Hand-drawn
