      \ fantasy races and classes and manage dozens of fighters as they battle in\
      \ a variety of different terrains against easy to highly intelligent AI or other\
      \ player-controlled clans. <br />\r\nTrain and hone each fighter\u2019s skill\
      \ through monthly training as well as directly in combat. Build secondary skills\
      \ such as dodging, shield blocking and dual wielding as well as attributes such\
      \ as strength, intelligence, hit points, and magic points. There are 200 items\
      \ and 42 spells available to equip your gladiators, including armors, bows,\
      \ weapons, magical staves, and more! As each combatant grows with your clan\
      \ they will age as well and eventually retire. Careful planning and management\
      \ of your clan can ensure you never have an off season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\

    review: "Good game if you are into old-school fantasy roguelike tactical games.\
      \ Has an interesting concept and is executed fairly well for being made in 2005.\
      \ I felt like the information of text was a little overloaded, but quickly found\
      \ myself learning the ropes. My only complaints are:\n\n-Graphics are fine,\
      \ the lack of resolution support leads to a lot of graininess and makes the\
      \ text hard to read.\n-The UI is not self explanatory, and lead to my death.\
      \ Would of been nice if the game explained you needed to put a checkmark next\
      \ to new recruits to have them participate in battles. \n-Misclicks are easy\
      \ to make and fatal like many others have stated controls aren't very polished\n\
      \nAll that aside, you should know that is what you are getting yourself into\
      \ purchasing this. I do think the un-discounted asking price is steep, but I\
      \ found this game fun and inspiring and hope to put some more hours into it\
      \ in the future."
