    review: 'The game looks promising but is a confusing mess  right now. Clicking
      on cards sometimes registers and sometimes does not. Character can move but
      no means to interact with anything. The game needs a tutorial. This is waayy
      early alpha at best.


      Nice graphics, nice music but little else seems to be present. You can move
      your character, discard cards and that was about it.


      Keep an eye on it but I cannot recommend it ... yet'
