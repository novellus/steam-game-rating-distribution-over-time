Doesn't require any significant grinding or farming.\n\nCONS:\n- Mostly default assets. A lot of non-default assets tend to be lacking.\n- Relies a lot on community in-jokes and references\n- Created during a series of Twitch streams. Stream chat had [i]a lot[/i] of input.\n- Too simple to have really fulfilling gameplay if you're looking for something with more meat to it.","timestamp_created":1595700150,"timestamp_updated":1595700150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7//Iw/MCf57BlwI="}
