    review: "I'll be reviewing all the Payday 2 DLC on a x/5 scale in relation to\
      \ the weapons and heists available as of 2020. \n\n[h1]Weapons[/h1]\n\n[b]Bernetti\
      \ Auto Pistol: 3/5[/b] While the super-low damage stat may be off-putting, a\
      \ couple of skills will do well to make this pistol worth using. Really, it's\
      \ the rate of fire where this thing shines. The base stat, for one pistol with\
      \ no skills, is 1101. That's already nearly the pace of the Vector/Micro/Jacket's\
      \ Piece. But when you factor in Gun Nut Aced and the ability to dual wield,\
      \ you can have an effective fire rate of [b]3302 rounds per minute.[/b] That's\
      \ faster than the fucking Minigun. Add on skills like Trigger Happy, One Handed\
      \ Talent, and Low Blow and your theoretical DPS will become truly immense. However,\
      \ there are some downsides. Stability, while decent enough, will strain under\
      \ the pure torrent of outgoing fire. Accuracy will never be good. And of course,\
      \ with great rate of fire comes with great ammo usage; you'll probably need\
      \ to use an ammo bag even if you pick up most of your drops. But if you tailor\
      \ your build just right, you can effectively become a hurricane of lead.\n\n\
      [b]Czech 92 Pistol: 3/5[/b] The CZ finally makes its way into Payday 2, and\
      \ honestly kinda baffles me. Its rate of fire, damage, accuracy, and stability\
      \ are all slightly better than the base game's Glock 18c, yet somehow it still\
      \ feels worse to use. Maybe the recoil animation is more disruptive, maybe the\
      \ firing and handling noises are worse, maybe it's just nostalgia. But for some\
      \ reason that I can't explain or understand, some reason that defies the objectively\
      \ better stats, I would rather use the G18. \n\n[b]Igor Automatik Pistol: 4/5[/b]\
      \ Like the Bizon before it, the Stechkin APS applies black magic to its 9x18\
      \ rounds to make them undeservedly powerful. Now while it's not quite 7.62 levels\
      \ here, it's still as powerful as the Crosskill class of handguns. And when\
      \ you apply all of the pistol skills to what is stat-wise an automatic .45,\
      \ you gets some shockingly high (and stable) DPS. Really the only problems are\
      \ the low ammo capacity and stability. Also, instead of using the same slightly\
      \ janky reload animation that the other two weapons in this pack share, the\
      \ heel-release is actually used! This results in a slightly longer, but overall\
      \ more satisfying animation that helps ease the pain of Jonas Wallin (the old\
      \ animator) moving on from Overkill.\n\n\n300% more automatic pistols in Payday\
      \ 2 for three bucks. Pretty damn good buy."
