I don't give bad reviews quickly but this has some pretty serious issues and after 7 levels of the campaign I'm not wasting any more time on it.\nSome redeeming qualities are the lore, creature design of myth units, the music is good and artwork but they fail to make a long time fan of the series be patient enough to sit out the glaring issues.\n","timestamp_created":1610141014,"timestamp_updated":1610141014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/8L48fYCcvjRwQI="}
