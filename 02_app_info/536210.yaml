    review: 'It is difficult to give this work a fair review. On one hand, every technical
      aspect works very well. It plays smoothly, and all the pieces preform what they
      are supposed to. It is meant to be a purely passive experience. As a free product,
      it delivers a properly working product.

      Unfortunately a Passive experience lives and dies on the contents of the story,
      and it is impossible to not compare this to Wall-E, a bar that this animation
      is in no way capable of living up to. The design is simple, yet uninspired and
      unexpressive, the character has only a single line, and yet nothing is done
      to use that line to convey an actual sense of dialog. Wall-E, Groot, and other
      characters with similarly limited vocabulary still use that minimalism to convey
      entire paragraphs of context.

      As for the story itself, it is either too vague, and I am missing it entirely,(which
      rarely happens) or it is so over simplified as to not even be recognizable as
      a story. There was a head, there was a problem, he met another head and together
      they pressed a button, and the problem was solved. For some reason that is meaningful?

      Perhaps all of this could have been ignored if there was something added by
      making this a VR experience. If any of this somehow showcased how a regular
      experience can be made more impressive by using VR as the medium, I would at
      least be able to say it''s worth trying, but I don''t feel anything like this.


      This feels like a school project where the student was busier checking to make
      sure they met all the stupid structural criteria to qualify for the grade, and
      then making sure they didn''t write anything too difficult to animate, that
      making sure the story was actually enjoyable was never factored into the equation.

      I don''t usually do this to a free product that has no actual technical issues,
      but I just can''t recommend this one.'
