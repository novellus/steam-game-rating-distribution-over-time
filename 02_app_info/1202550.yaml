    review: "What I write for this review is the experience I had with the game, everybody\
      \ will experience things differently. This is my honest review if you don't\
      \ like it well tough. Also no game is safe from a review whether its early access\
      \ or full release, now onto the review.\n\nZombie Busters VR is an anime stand\
      \ still shooter game. You only have to turn to look in different directions\
      \ to eliminate zombies for a score playing until the game is beat or you die\
      \ in the end totaling your score. This game has no relation to the other Zombie\
      \ Buster VR game even though they are almost similar just one is anime style.\
      \ \n\nThe game-play is what you expect from a stand in one place type of game.\
      \ You have no moving option which isn't a bad thing as long the game is good\
      \ for the style.\n\nSounds in the game is okay nothing out of the ordinary except\
      \ that there is no audio option to turn the game down, you have to turn it down\
      \ on the computer so you don't blow your ear drums out.\n\nThere is only one\
      \ weapon in the game & all the characters use the same weapon. The only thing\
      \ to make them powerful are shoot-able power ups to give you a few shots to\
      \ eliminate zombies faster & easier but no way to store the pick ups for later.\
      \ the only issue I have with the weapons is they are not proper height so shooting\
      \ is awkward.\n\nThe characters are okay without English audio or subtitle its\
      \ hard to understand what each character is saying.\n\nThe bosses are unique\
      \ & have their own powers making them different but in the end there is nothing\
      \ to really do to specifically beat them. Just shoot until they die avoiding\
      \ or prevent their ability from damaging you. The only boss I have trouble with\
      \ is the giant boss. Not sure how to defeat him before dying. \n\nThere is no\
      \ co-op which is disappointing since that is on feature that got me to buy the\
      \ game in the first place.\n\nZombie Busters VR is a good game & with more updates,\
      \ fixes & more features it can be a fun game but with the audio, no co-op &\
      \ weapon issues I listed its not really worth playing to be honest. The game\
      \ gets a 4/10 score making it under average & making it not recommendable."
