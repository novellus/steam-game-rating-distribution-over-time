    review: Camp W is a thoroughly cute and enjoyable little VN. It's structured like
      a dating sim, but without any of the creepiness that makes dating sims gross.
      You turn up at summer camp, you can choose which people to hang out with, at
      the end you might make a friend. It's totally platonic and much more representative
      of real-world relationships than most VNs. I guess if you play through multiple
      times you can uncover a bit more of the lore, but i was happy with one playthrough,
      which takes about 2 hours. The dialog is light-hearted and sprinkled with silly
      puns and a few clever jokes for grown-ups. The characters are stereotypes, but
      not in a way that feels too forced given they are mostly children. I played
      as an adult and found it charming, but i think children the same age as the
      characters would enjoy this game too. Wholesome without being cloying. Just
      great stuff. Definitely worth buying if you are even a little bit into VNs.
