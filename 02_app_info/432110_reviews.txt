Both games are now normally sold and I couldn't help notice that 'Phoenix' sells for almost [i]twice[/i] the price as 'Intro'. So imagine my surprise when I managed to successfully finish Phoenix in no longer than 20 minutes, while I've been busy with Intro for at least 40 - 50 minutes. That's just bizarre...  And it gets worse: I own other visual novel games which sell for even less than 'Intro' does while they provide an easy 90 minutes worth of gameplay.\n\n[h1]Don't address adult subjects if you're not going to follow up![/h1]\n\nThis is the part I plain out dislike...  So the main protagonist (Shizume) is looking for a job and ends up as an escort, she even allows someone to grope her. However, the pictures themselves show absolutely nothing. Heck... even 'Intro' was more naughty than this game.\n\nWhy bother to bring up adult topics like escort services if you're not going to follow up on them with the animations? That's just bad...  Keep in mind though: I'm not necessarily looking for b00bies here, but [i]you (devs)[/i] opened the door to it and then you don't deliver.\n\nAnd that's where my \"wasted potential\" comment came from, this could have easily been avoided. For example... instead of doing escort you could have made Shizume apply for job as a (semi-) erotic dancer. She'd had to dress up in a skimpy outfit (which could easily be displayed because it would be less revealing than her undies) and perform in public which could then embarrass her a little bit. \n\nIt seems to me as if the game wanted the 'adult tease' but without doing the work for it, and yah, I think that's the cheap and easy way out.\n\n[h1]In conclusion....[/h1]\n\nIt's really a shame because this game honestly has [u]a lot[/u] of potential, it really does. The drawings are very solid, some truly manage to create the right atmosphere for the story. I also enjoyed the music that's been used, very fitting for the genre.\n\nBut it's just bizarre that a game which easily costs twice as much as its predecessor (or demo?) provides a lot less contents, so much that it's easily noticeable.\n\nI don't hate on this title, I also don't think it's bad or something, but I simply cannot recommend this to others for reasons shared above.\n\nThanks for reading!","timestamp_created":1593292031,"timestamp_updated":1593353312,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525542378425598145","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8MLQ/fICe+TpkAI="}
