      a 9x9 grid, where each row correlates with one of your spell slots. You can

    review: 'This is an annoyingly fun lil game. The gimmick of only casting spells
      when you''re on the associated row feels fun at first but really opens itself
      up to more depth as you unlock more characters and familiarize yourself with
      each area. Each encounter uses the same enemies each time, but their abilities
      are interesting enough that just placing them randomly around the board each
      run still makes them feel like a unique puzzle each time. The play field is
      a little overstimulating at first but was easy to get a hang of, which is really
      helped by the vibrant and expressive art. I especially loved the player character
      art. Each PC option radiates overwhelmingly smug energy in a new and unique
      way. Overall: recommended!'
