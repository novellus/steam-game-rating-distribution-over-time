Once again, another good Visual Novel developed by Afterthought Studios.\n\nThe art for this VN is good and really simple. The atmosphere formed when it is combined with the gentle and relaxing BGM at certain scenes is just great. I find myself lost listening to the BGM and forgetting to press \"Next\" until the text changed due to auto-forward. During the serious scenes, the BGM is nicely matched as well.\n\nThe character interactions between Engel and his Guardian Angel are funny and I like it.\n\nStory wise is good, to see the thought process of Engel and the choices he makes in the progress of the story. It is definitely much better to read it again in New Game+! Definitely worth getting there along with the twist.\n\nNo doubt this being a good VN, there are a couple of minor flaws in the game but that does not hinder me and my experience being positive.\n\nGiving this a 7.5/10!\n\nDo get this game and play it","timestamp_created":1508564661,"timestamp_updated":1508564661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614215672016143799","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sL7dnt8CfLXwiAE="}
