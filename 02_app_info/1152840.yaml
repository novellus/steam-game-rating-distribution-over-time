    short_description: Every year or so a Gator Parade is held. In which, a noble
      candidate must solve the problems of the local townspeople in hopes of becoming
      the next Gator Mayor. The only problem is that you slept in and now must rush
      to the big city with a strange collection of friends made along the way.
