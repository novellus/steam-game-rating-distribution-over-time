    about_the_game: 'A steam-ship period naval combat games focusing on fleet-scale
      battles in real time. The naval combat game allows you to set up battle squadron
      groups, their formations and management, with realistic ship models and characteristics,
      as well as advanced ballistic and weapon models. <br />

      <br />

      (Alternative History) In the second half of 1880s, the policy of imperialism
      in the tropical Pacific led to a local naval conflict between the U.S., Chile,
      the German Empire and the Kingdom of Spain.<br />

      None of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of
      colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule Oceania.<br

      Panama Crisis with Chile vs USA 1885<br />

      <br />

      In 1884 Chile emerged from the War of the Pacific as a potential threat to the
      hegemony of the United States. The Chilean navy, then the strongest fleet in
      the Pacific, was able to confront American policy. In 1882 Chile refused US
      mediation in the War of the Pacific. In 1885, as the United States Navy occupied
      Colon, then part of Colombia, the Chilean government ordered its navy to occupy
      Panama City and to force the American squadron to evacuate Colon.<br />

      Caroline Islands Crisis with Germany vs Spain 1885<br />

      <br />

      Germany began her colonial enterprise very late and was, therefore, at a disadvantage,
      finding all the desirable places already occupied. The Spaniards claimed the
      Caroline Islands as their colony, but did not actually control them. Germany
      disputed the Spanish claim.<br />

      <br />

      In August of 1885, Spain sent warships to Yap (Caroline Islands) to assert their
      territorial claim; however, the German government was aware of these ships and
      its squadron arrived the night before the Spanish landed.<br />

      Marianas Incident with Spain vs USA 1887<br />

      <br />

      To strengthen its position in the Pacific Ocean; the United States needs to
      control at least one of the tropical islands such as the Spanish Mariana Islands,
      or the Samoan archipelago. Events in Cuba and internal problems did not allow
      Spain to strengthen its colony in Oceania. The Great powers were not interested
      in supporting the interests of Spain in the Pacific and did not interfere in
      the conflict. <br />

      <br />

      None of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of
      colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule the Mariana
      Islands after 1887.<br />
