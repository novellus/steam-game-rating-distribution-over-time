      \ you control the guests of a costume party.<br />\r\nA mysterious entity grants\
      \ powers to some chosen ones, imprisoning them in a magic barrier. They will\
      \ have to fight each other if they want to free themselves from this prison.<br\

      \ her symbolic fairy costume. His faithful bodyguard, Louren\xE7o, will have\
      \ much work to protect her in the troubled events that will follow. Besides\
      \ them we also have angel, succubus, scarecrow, platypus and many beings full\
      \ of personality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSYSTEM<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIn the TRAF\
      \ universe, the characters gained powers according to their fantasies. Its cosmic\
      \ and human powers are represented in the arrangement of the 4-button attack,\
      \ in which we have two for the normal and two for the powers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nHuman attacks are on the normal weak and normal strong buttons.<br />\r\n\
      The powers are represented on the alpha and beta buttons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      To perform the powers, you expend the energy of your Ghana Bar. This bar is\
      \ also important for various actions such as canceling defense and allowing\
      \ cancellations that extend combos. The most efficient way to fill it is to\
      \ hit normal attacks on the opponent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the character loses\
      \ his life energy, his barbell gains benefits. Among these advantages are a\
      \ lower expense of winning for supers and cancellations between powers, thus\
      \ allowing larger combos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLAST FORCES MODE<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe Bar of Ghana still has a surprise factor.<br />\r\nIf the character is\
      \ not defeated with a Super, then this bar can assume the role of life. this\
      \ represents the character fighting to the last forces.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n\
      In this case, the Bar maintains both functions, both Ghana and Life characteristics,\
      \ giving the player more opportunity to win, but costing each error.<br />\r\
      \n <br />\r\nEach character has a unique style of play and a wide variety of\
      \ combinations to explore. The cancellations are very free, having as main limitation\
      \ the amount of Barra, requiring a good administration of this on the part of\
