    review: "\"You don't really drive the machine, you ARE THE MACHINE, and pretty\
      \ much every movement you make with your hands, arms, head, neck and upper body\
      \ can control the steering. I'm not sure VR racing can get more immersive, more\
      \ personal than this.\"\n----Me and my pup, Chiquita\n\nBut steering can also\
      \ be quite simple, such as using an XBox-type controller, or just leaning from\
      \ side to side, or even lying on your back with only your hands steering. \n\
      \n(Review section on playing as a disabled gamer toward bottom. But keep in\
      \ mind, R42 is NOT a \"disabled game\". It is a game that this reviewer believes\
      \ just about anyone can play and enjoy tremendously.)\n\nI\u2019m a big fan\
      \ of Steam-offered driving/racing games (owning dozens), and at the very least\
      \ the Store Page description of R42 offered something new and unusual. And I\
      \ must say, R42 has delivered! It took me a bit to understand that my every\
      \ body movement while waiting at the starting line might change the direction\
      \ faced, but that is easily understood, and that unprecedented degree of response\
      \ is THE strongest game feature (IMHO.)\n\nWhile R42 stresses the use of VR\
      \ controllers (Oculus Rift and Rift S, in my case), it seems that they can act\
      \ entirely as the gas pedal. What was so difficult for me to originally realize\
      \ is that movement control is achieved by a combination of leaning and moving\
      \ the controllers from side to side. If you wished, while acclimating to this\
      \ concept, the controllers could remain stationary. (They could rest in your\
      \ lap, if you wish.) There are three types of controller use available, but\
      \ I can only speak for the VR controller method. Gamepad allows for more traditional\
      \ steering control. Centroid is the VR controller method, and seems to provide\
      \ the most complete amount of \"full body\" control. Bike is for VR controllers\
      \ to be held to the front of the body (such as while lying prone.) For ultimate\
      \ control it seems best to combine leaning with a side-to-side controller movement,\
      \ which can result in a great, rapidly responsive means of movement control.\
      \ For anyone thinking this doesn\u2019t present a challenge; please allow me\
      \ to respectfully correct you. It can be every bit as challenging for your body\
      \ to do the steering (perhaps more so) than the more traditional controller\
      \ driving techniques of stick or wheel. But whichever your choice, it's a new\
      \ world of driving control to me, and one I am excited to explore. But I can\
      \ say with some confidence that there may be no more immersive way to drive\
      \ than for your every movement to act to drive your vehicle. In fact, it's much\
      \ more a feeling that you ARE the vehicle. (DON'T scratch your nose in the middle\
      \ of a race! And try not to sneeze....)\n\nThere are essentially two challenges\
      \ to each track: finishing while scoring the best time, and finding shortcuts\
      \ that can cut large portions off of each track's time. (There is no such thing\
      \ as cheating in R42!) Currently there are 10 tracks, and more are being added\
      \ regularly. Multiplayer isn't ready yet, though you do race against named AI\
      \ opponents. The global and friends leaderboards are now available (not within\
      \ R42, but within Steam), and they update immediately upon exiting.\n\nOn some\
      \ tracks the goal is to collect as many speed-enhancing power-ups as possible\
      \ to improve your time, and while the challenge to react quickly enough is great,\
      \ it's far from impossible. Some tracks involve (literally) \"leaps of faith\"\
      \ into space, with numerous possibilities for your landing site. Other tracks\
      \ don't have power-ups, but require tight corners, and that constant lookout\
      \ for the elusive (and sometimes numerous) shortcuts. And I must add, the Discord\
      \ community is made up entirely of helpful and supportive R42 gamers (and almost\
      \ instantly responsive developers.)\n\nAs a disabled gamer, VR has been both\
      \ a godsend and a crushing disappointment. I love the opportunity the best of\
      \ VR games give me to feel that I have, however briefly, left this bed that\
      \ is my home at least 23 hours of most days. But many otherwise excellent VR\
      \ games involve too much physicality (for some of us), and thus too much difficulty\
      \ and discomfort. And so when I encountered the R42 Store Page, I was immediately\
      \ intrigued. And I have not been in the least disappointed! What I love most\
      \ about R42 is simply the exceptionally fluid feeling of movement. It's as wonderful\
      \ a feeling of movement as I've ever felt in any game (of any type) in my life.\
      \ The controls are perfectly responsive to even the slightest movements, and\
      \ can be adapted to gamers standing, sitting, or lying prone. No use of fingers\
      \ is needed to control, and in fact a rubber band can be used to activate a\
      \ trigger's only setting: ON. And if you choose to integrate VR controllers\
      \ into your steering strategy (highly recommended!), they can be strapped to\
      \ your hands, arms or wrists, and still be 100% functional. I have had no issues\
      \ with nausea, even with a severe and chronic sinus issue. The freedom of movement\
      \ that is denied me IRL has found its way into my life by way of R42, and I\
      \ am deeply grateful for these developers, and for their passion both for this\
      \ game and for their customers.\n\nAt the bottom it says, Do you recommend this\
      \ game?\" (Hmmm... What do you think?)\n\nThank you for reading. I hope you\
      \ have the opportunity to enjoy R42 as much as I have."
