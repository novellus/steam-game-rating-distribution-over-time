    review: "I believe Silver Grappler deserves way more hype than it got. The small\
      \ amount of reviews and one total walkthrough online do not reflect the game\u2019\
      s quality. In silver grapple, you play as a janitor in a scientific research\
      \ building where an earthquake occurs.  it\u2019s your job to round up any other\
      \ survivors and make your way out of the building. The main mechanic is the\
      \ grappling hook, which allows you to swing on certain walls. The momentum of\
      \ this feels amazing, playing this game makes you really feel like Spider-Man.\
      \ This game reminds me a lot of Celeste. One very simple concept, but used in\
      \ many very clever ways with new mechanics in each area. It\u2019s also really\
      \ hard (I died like 4500 times over the whole game), but you restart at the\
      \ beginning of each area like Celeste, allowing you to get right back into the\
      \ action. What silver grapple does differently, is that it\u2019s a metrodivania.\
      \ There is a big focus on exploration, and gaining upgrades to use in previous\
      \ areas. A lot of the game is fairly linear platforming, but unlocking things\
      \ and having to go back made me feel smart. I really liked getting a new upgrade,\
      \ getting to experiment with the controls of the new mechanic, and then go back\
      \ to where I remembered needing it earlier. It keeps the game fresh, but still\
      \ keeps the focus on the grappling hook. On the other hand, this brings in one\
      \ of my gripes with the game: there\u2019s no way to mark the map. Many times\
      \ I found things to go back to, but I had no way to remember where they were.\
      \ This made me heavily reliant on the one walkthrough that exists. Another thing\
      \ that made exploration difficult is that sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell if\
      \ certain elements are in the background or not. More than once, I consulted\
      \ the walkthrough only to find out the next place I had to go was a door in\
      \ a room I had already explored but didn\u2019t see because it was a black door\
      \ over a black background. Also the map is incredibly expansive, which makes\
      \ backtracking tricky. But overall, these issues were minor compared to my enjoyment\
      \ throughout the rest of the play though. The game also has a pretty interesting\
      \ story (at least for what it needs to be, it does take a backseat to the gameplay.)\
      \ There\u2019s an interesting twist, two different endings, and even a side\
      \ romance. You get to learn a lot more about what\u2019s going on with the plethora\
      \ of notebooks you can collect, which are a fun distraction. All this together,\
      \ makes me really sad for the creator. Because it\u2019s clear he put a lot\
      \ of love into this game, but it didn\u2019t get a lot of attention. Apparently\
      \ I have 16 hours logged into the game, but some of that might have been when\
      \ I left the game on to look up a walkthrough. If you like Celeste or even just\
      \ tough platformers I would highly suggest it.\n\nAlso, here\u2019s how to get\
      \ the good ending because I found that no one discloses that information and\
      \ you\u2019d have to play the entire game over again if you wanted to get it:\
      \ [spoiler] When Zach says he needs to go and find someone, you need to save\
      \ the person he goes to find [/spoiler]\nIf you would like to know where that\
      \ is, look here: [spoiler] In the hospital, you go into the door with the cross\
      \ above it. Then you go into the room with the elevator and take it down. You\u2019\
      ll need the red, yellow, and blue keycards to open doors, and then you\u2019\
      ll come across that character. [/spoiler]\n\n_Ratings_\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nStory:\
      \ 8/10\nMusic: 8/10\nExploration: 6/10\nOverall: 8/10"
