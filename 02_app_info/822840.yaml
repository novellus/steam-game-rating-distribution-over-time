    developer_response: 'Hello Zaxtor !


      Thanks for your feedback. As you may have noticed, this is an early access title,
      so everything is far from perfect. The game is not finished, obviously. This
      is why we released it as an Early Access title and not a finished version.


      As for the bugs you mentioned in your video, they have all been fixed. We take
      your feedback very seriously. As such we would like to thank you again for your
      valuable input !


      We are quite a small team, this is one of the reasons the game is Early Access.
      We are counting on people''s feedback to address any issues with the game early
      in development.


      We hope that with future updates you will be able to enjoy our game.


      Regards,


      The S.E.E.D. Team'

    review: 'UPDATE (April 4, 2018):  Looks like I''m still the only one silly enough
      to buy and review this mess that''s an obvious money grab scam from their own
      trailer on the Steam store page.  However, I want to point out the following
      occurances since my review and video were made in this image to make it all
      public knowledge:

      Only the worst of the worst games earn a spot in my "M.I.S.S." Games video series:

      https://youtu.be/viG1arJwq-8


      Seeing unfinished game projects using free assets on Steam is nothing new these
      days, but at least most of the developers who toss up these messes onto Steam
      set the price of their garbage with a one or two dollar price tag in hopes of
      generating a few sales.


      That isn''t the case with "METAL : Iron Age".  This developer for some crazy
      reason seems to believe that his buggy, unfinished, mess of a Unity game is
      worthy of a $25 price tag.  Don''t let the price tag make you think that this
      game might have some redeeming value.. there is NOTHING of any value what-so-ever
      in this game.. err not game but rather incomplete bug infested tutorial project.


      This game makes most GameGuru games and games like "The Slaughtering Grounds"
      by the infamous Digital Homicide look like masterpieces, and the asking price
      for this game has to be an early Aprils fools joke.  There is simply no other
      logical explanation for this.  There is also NO excuse for this game being on
      Steam, but hey.. that''s a whole different subject for a different day.


      This game earned my lowest score of any Steam game ever, a mind boggling -16%
      (yes negative 16 percent score)'
