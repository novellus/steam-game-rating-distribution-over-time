    review: "I\u2019d probably go with a mixed review if I could. The hidden object\
      \ scenes are okay, but the point and click adventure part has some pixel hunting\
      \ and there is no instant travel map or even a regular map. The setting is 19th\
      \ century New Orleans where you have to save the city from evil forces that\
      \ use voodoo. Fortunately, you have begun learning voodoo yourself and are able\
      \ to pick up a few spells along the way. It\u2019s an interesting premise, but\
      \ I\u2019ll go with a thumbs down because the story is incomplete. The game\
      \ ends on a cliffhanger and they never made a sequel. \n\nThis game was released\
      \ in 2011 and runs okay under Windows 10. The version sold on Steam is the ordinary\
      \ edition, not the collectors\u2019 edition with a bonus chapter. The bonus\
      \ chapter was added in the middle though, so both versions have the same cliffhanger\
      \ ending."
