    review: 'DuelVox is a decently made little time-waster.

      You control your left and right hands by pressing down the equivalent mouse
      buttons while moving. Your aim is a little off in perspective to where the gun
      is pointing at (with no rectangle, imagine KC:D bows). It requires a bit of
      practise, but it''s actually pretty fun to play with, once you get used to it.

      You can get upgrades in the store, including laser-aim for easier targeting
      too.'
