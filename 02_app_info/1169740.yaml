    developer_response: "The game is in Early Access and has changed a lot during\
      \ that time thanks to feedback from our community. We have no control over Steam's\
      \ refund policy, so don't get angry with us. We think Mr. Miyagi would have\
      \ some wise advice that the Early Access game is changing and it is worth giving\
      \ it a shot before a sentence is passed.\nWe are only an independent game developer,\
      \ but we try very hard to make the game as good as possible \u30C4"

    review: 'Nothing at all to make this stand out from any other title in the genre.
      Totally okay to miss this and not feel bad about it. The whole game is a pretty
      dry and static grey haze of basic top-down shooter mechanics.


      On top of that, they didn''t honor my refund within Steam''s parameters.


      2/10 - it''s a working game, good for you!'
