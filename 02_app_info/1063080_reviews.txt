The basic plot of this episode is that the Fuhrer wants to beat out Disney to ensure that Germany is the key player in world wide animation. You're key decision is whether or not you will use actual German ideas, or contract out to foreign companies. SPOILERS AHEAD: In my play through I decided to use the glorious German animators, and Flute recommends first Ninja Turtles, but later Transformers. With the help of Leni Riefenstahl, you manage to make the most kick-ass cartoon ever, and you also get a massive toy deal, making Germany the talk of the animation and toy industry for the next thousand years!
