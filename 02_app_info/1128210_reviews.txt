Combat is also a little 'floaty' i.e weapons just sorta phase through enemies instead of colliding like most melee-focused VR games. Can't really fault it for $4 but I'm left-handed so I'm unable to play the game properly.\n\nThat said, the aesthetic was pretty cool and there are killable passive NPCs which you almost never see in VR games. Voice acting was a bit funny but I suppose it holds a certain charm.","timestamp_created":1608724688,"timestamp_updated":1609078739,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508928596973419189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g6Kk0vYCdPG2vAI="}
