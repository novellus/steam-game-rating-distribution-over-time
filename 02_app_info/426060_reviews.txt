You must clear ALL the monsters on the level to win the challenge. There are no new monsters, traps, or puzzles. It is essentially jump into the map, evade and fight until you clear all the monsters. Monsters give no experience points or treasure. The only expereince and treasure you get are after you finish the challenge a bag appears near the area exit. I have played through ALL 9 challenges and must admit the loot is junk! I think I got one item in all 9 challenges that was worth anything. The rest were stones and 25 copper, 18 copper, etc... Not very rewarding. Oh and you get some experience too when clearing a challenge (about 400xp which is a joke compared to the number of monsters you just cleared).\n\nA point system is generated somehow by your success and is displayed on the wall outside each challenge. Weird thing is that the score board for each challenge does not seem to  show you your highest score at completing the challenge, but your last score. So, if you scored 40,000 the first try and then entered the same area a second time and scored 38,500, the score board for that particular challenge would show 38,500 as the score and not the high score of 40,000.\n\nI am a fan of this game, but not so much this DLC, I think for $3.99 considering the complete game is $12.99 is a bit high for the little content you get. The challenge idea is a nice one, but becomes boring fast as the challenge is the same all the time. Enter area, kill all monsters. No quests, or differing goals. Do NOT bother picking this up for $3.99. $1.99 or $2.49 yea maybe at that price point.\n\nI would have rather seen a DLC that adds new dungeons (not arena maps), new monsters, new quests, new spells, items, skills, etc... Hell, I'd like to see a DLC with all of that and a complete EDITOR to make your own maps, quests, items, spells, skills, monsters, stories, etc...","timestamp_created":1457986520,"timestamp_updated":1457986664,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.725978434085845947","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5N6xu9MCc7moUw=="}
