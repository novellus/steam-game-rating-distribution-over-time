Eggs 1942 is a gritty, dark, and disheartening story from the perspective of soldiers. It tells the sad story of what it's like to fight on the front lines through dialogue and the world around it. This game is amazing. A true hidden gem among the rubbish that steam sells. In the modern AAA environment it's great to see such bold steps being taken by an indie dev. An absolute must-have for any real gamer.","timestamp_created":1604349945,"timestamp_updated":1604349945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4yqytxfUCfc3xqwI="}
