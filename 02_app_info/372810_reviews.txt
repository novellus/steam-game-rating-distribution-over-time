There is some really good stuff in here and some of the pictures in-game can truly set a good atmosphere.\n\nWell, now you can enjoy some of those outside the game using this DLC. The reason I'm calling this honest is because the preview on the store page shows you [i]exactly[/i] what you're going to get: 9 anime pictures. And if you want to know what I meant with atmosphere: take a close look at the city overview, it's one of my favorites. [u]That's[/u] what I call setting up a good atmosphere.\n\n[h1]In conclusion...[/h1]\n\nSolely looking at the artwork and the price of the DLC I think this is a solid buy and a welcome addition to the game. Like I said above (and in the review of the actual game): I may not have enjoyed the game all too much, but I was quite pleased with the artwork, some of it is simply plain out good. Which makes this a good buy I think.","timestamp_created":1593911379,"timestamp_updated":1593911379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567680895328521729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w7ChjvMCcbjwkgI="}
