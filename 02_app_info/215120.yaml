      \ do know, however, that nothing existed before Arua. The Goddess of life, souls,\
      \ and all existence created the universe as she saw fit\u2026 a calm and beautiful\
      \ place where souls could dwell peacefully. The deep matters of the universe\
      \ cradled the waves of life, on which all beings would sway soothingly. This\
      \ perfect universe was called the Sea of Souls.<br><br>Life would bring shine\
      \ to the Sea of Souls, in the form of seven planets. Arua created these out\
      \ of love, and dedicated each of them to the inhabitants that she breathed life\
      \ into.<br><br>&quot;The planets, as your lives, dear ones, are all yours. As\

      \ will receive from them.&quot;<br><br>And thus, the Gods were created, to watch\
      \ over all life that Arua had created among the seven planets. And Arua named\
      \ the planets after each of the Gods and Goddesses that would look after them:\
      \ Junon, Lunar, Eldeon, Orlo, Karkia, Skaaj, and Hebarn.<br><br>Each planet's\

    review: No Invert mouse setting.  Unplayable for those of us that use that.  Looked
      promising, but I don't expect to ever be able to find out how I would actually
      like the game.
