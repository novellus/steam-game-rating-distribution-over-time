    review: "Omija\u0107 to, to jest g\xF3owno. Wygl\u0105da \u0142adnie, ale mechanicznie\
      \ to dno. Trzymanie broni, celowanie, prze\u0142adowanie wszystko jest tu zepsute.\
      \ Pr\xF3bowa\u0142em z uporem, bo wygl\u0105da \u0142adnie, ale niestety nie\
      \ da si\u0119 w to normalnie gra\u0107 bez wkurrwa na to jak kto\u015B to zepsu\u0142\
