    about_the_game: <strong>Light and Embers</strong> is a relaxing experience.  Just
      sit back and listen to the crackle of the fire and the chirping of the birds.  We
      provided you with several logs so if the fire starts to burn out you can always
      add a log or stoke the fire to keep it burning.  If you need help relaxing we've
      provided you with a few songs that we hope you will enjoy.  <br><br>Please sit
      back and relax :)<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1306250/extras/Light_and_Embers_Steam_Description_2.png?t=1600902571"
      /><br><br><strong><i>FAQ</i></strong><br><i><strong>What kind of game is Light
      and Embers?</strong></i> Light and Embers is more of an experience than a game.  Think
      of it as a fire simulator but without all the work and stress of actually having
      to keep a fire burning. <br><br><i><strong>What kind of gameplay is it?</strong></i>  You
      sit back, relax, and listen.  When the fire starts to burn out you can point
      and click with your mouse to add a log or stoke the fire. <br><br><i><strong>How
      much play time is in the game?</strong></i>  You can sit and enjoy the fire
      for as long as you wish.  The fire will burn for around 5 minutes if you don't
      add logs or stoke the fire.  There is an infinite mode where the fire will never
      burn out. <br><br><i><strong>Can I bring marshmallows? </strong></i> Yes, but
      they will not roast on this fire :(

    short_description: Relax. Listen to the crackle of the fire and the chirping of
      the birds. Add a log or two if the fire starts to burn out. Enjoy a calm and
      stress-free campfire.
