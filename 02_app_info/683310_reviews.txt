It comes with a story mode inspired by Cybernoid and a seperate survival mode named Eugatron inspired by Robotron and Llamatron. I don't think I've played any of those games but I have played similar games on the C64 and I enjoy twin stick shooters.\n\n[b]Cecconoid[/b]\nLooks like a greyscale+red reimagination of Cybernoid with smooth gameplay, nice multiplier system, plenty of rooms, a few secrets and multiple upgrades. It's pretty tough. You start slow with a wimpy shooter but with every upgrade you improve. However when you lose a life you drop your upgrades. If you then don't pick them up quick enough they disappear and you're stuck with a vanilla spaceship again for the time being. You just need to learn from your mistakes and get ahead further before you die again :) Some enemies and items will give out stars on destruction which will increase your multiplier when you pick them up. Other items give out '100' bonuses you can pick up which will be multiplied by the multiplier\n\n[b]Eugatron[/b]\nYour spaceship is thrown into the middle of a room with enemies which you have to clear before you get transported to the next. There are indestructable big enemies that just move around slowly, enemies that can be destroyed some of which shoot while others spawn new enemies. There are also items that give out the '100' bonuses upon destruction. When you reach certain scores an extra life is awarded.\n\nFor a relatively simple survival game it took me quite some time to get familiar with it. Once it started to click it became very enjoyable and I worked myself up the leaderboard. I was clueless about some game mechanics which were later pointed out to me by the developer.\n\n[b]Tips[/b]\nThe first enemy ship in Eugatron that gets destroyed will give out an upgrade if you're the one that destroys it.\nPicking up an upgrade will make you invincible for a short period of time.\nYour multiplier drops when you shoot.\nTry to get your multiplier up before you pick up bonuses.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIf you like challenging 80s retro shmups Cecconoid might be a game you enjoy. If you like twin stick shooters and/or survival games Eugatron will be a game you enjoy once you get accustomed to the 8-directional shooting.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nHere's a recording of me reaching the top score in Eugatron. In each level I tried to raise the multiplier to maximize scoring.\nhttps://youtu.be/4pcXhgWWR_E","timestamp_created":1594378163,"timestamp_updated":1597485659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t5bk+PMCdMCklAI="}
