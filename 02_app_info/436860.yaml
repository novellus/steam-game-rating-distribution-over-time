    short_description: Arctic alive - a simulator with elements of survival horror.
      The action takes place in Siberia on the research station &quot;Arctic&quot;.
      There was something in what is necessary to understand the player. The world
      is open for exploration.

    review: 'This is my review of Arctic Alive:


      STORY

      You are trapped in a cell for some reason and you need to escape.You are into
      some kind of laboratory of some kind.Threw the game you will find notes before
      everyone died in this laboratory.Somekind of experiments were done and some
      people got infected to it.The rest of the people who didn''t got infected tried
      to survive,but unfortunately they did not.In short it is a good little story.I
      liked it.


      Survival Mechanics

      Whether you played this game 30 minutes to finish.You will be introduced to
      a lot of mechanics.First of all this is a survival horror game.Second of all
      I enjoyed these survival mechanics, because it is more complex,like for example
      to shower or use water to fill the gardening can or water canister to water
      the plants   you need to go to the basement and manually pump water but to get
      there you will face an enemy.


      Enemies

      As I said this is a survival horror game, so there is an enemy that hunts you.This
      enemy is the people who got infected.You can hit the with the axe that you will
      find in a room in the basement and they will die temporarily and make a puddle
      of liquid that will hurt you when you go threw it.In general the enemies are
      great but sometimes they are annoying.


      To be clear this game is not perfect because there are bugs that I encountered.There
      is a game breaking bug where you cannot find the artifacts.To be more clearer,I
      did not finish the game because of that bug even If I reload a save.I cannot
      find any artifacts,I searched every room,every angle but there was not signal,
      and yes I searched the outside.For the final verdict I give Arctic Alive 8.5/10.-1
      point for the bugs(there were more bugs,not just the one that I said in the
      review for example) and -0,5 point for the performance issues I had(by that
      I mean the frame rate drops frequently).I recommend it.'
