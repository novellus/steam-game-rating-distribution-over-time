    about_the_game: Powerboat VR is an advanced speed boat simulator designed specifically
      for VR. It includes a robust physics engine which allows the boats to react
      realistically to the fully dynamic 3D ocean wave system which is capable of
      simulating everything from a calm lagoon to white capped and unpredictable open
      water. <br><br>The world of Powerboat VR includes several tropical islands each
      offering a variety of inshore, offshore and open water races pitting you against
      AI opponents. If you wish, you can even invite a local Co-op player into these
      races. You will require all your skills to navigate the changing sea conditions,
      drive your boat optimally and plot the winning course. <br><br>Between races
      you are free to explore the islands as you wish or you can earn extra XP by
      delivering cargo between the island's cities, towns and ports. As you earn XP
      you will unlock additional boats which you can then pilot at anytime.<br><br>While
      on your travels keep an eye out for various animal life such as sharks and birds
      - you never know what you might spot!<br><br>Key Points<br><br>1. Fully physics
      driven boat/buoyancy simulation.<br>2. Various types of races from short, technical
      courses to long offshore/open water racing that transitions between different
      sea conditions.<br>3. Diverse range of boats available including R.I.Bs, sport
      and powerboats.<br>4. Dynamic 3D ocean wave system with varying sea conditions.<br>5.
      Dynamic &amp; controllable time of day.<br>6. Fully interactive VR controls.<br>7.
      Play how ever you wish - race, deliver cargo, explore or simply enjoy the sun
      setting over the water!<br>8. Need some help? This game supports local, <strong>none
      VR</strong>, co-op so a friend can join in to help you earn extra XP!<br>9.
      Varied wildlife to discover and observe including fish and birds.<br>10. Support
      for room scale, standing and seated VR experience.
