Fun concept of having dueling players build decks to play specifically against one other person in a draft duel but the mechanics of the game make 90% of matches a rock paper scissors match of do you get to play your cards or does your opponent get to play theirs. No matter how cool of a deck you can build, either you win because you just did damage and the other player didn't get to do anything to make the match interesting or your that player who doesn't get to play. The only \"close matches\" I've played were mirror-like matches where both players just punched each other until the one with initiative gets the killing blow. I believe the game is still being developed while I'm writing this review so I'm sure they're still tweaking and I hope the experience gets better but unfortunately for me that would require completely abandoning several key mechanics that I believe they want to define the game.","timestamp_created":1609095397,"timestamp_updated":1609095397,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ46Ofj0vYCd9zrvQI="}
