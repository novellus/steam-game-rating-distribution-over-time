    review: 'Played on Oculus Rift S


      This is a wave based VR Archery game where you have to defend your village from
      enemy minions along with your own life. You only have your bow to defend with.
      You do get to pick a upgrade/spell after a few waves which you can use if you
      hold an arrow pulled at max strength for a few seconds, but besides that you
      don''t get anything else. The village has it''s own HP along with you having
      separate HP as well. The game ends once you get hit enough, or enough minions
      reach the villagers.


      Controls:

      Pressing the A button on your right controller switches which hand is holding
      the bow, while you use the other hand to pull an arrow back with the other hand
      via the trigger button. You only stand in one spot, so there''s no movement
      or teleportation, and you also can''t rotate in-game.


      Pros:

      - Variety of different enemies to kill, with some running straight at the entrance
      to your village, some summoning more minions and others that will attack you
      directly via projectiles or flying into you.

      - Some upgrades do make it easier to deal with groups of enemies or aims arrows
      for you

      - It''s cheap at only $3 AU.


      Neutral:

      - Nothing really stood out either in sound or music

      - Some upgrades aren''t that good, like the multi-shot upgrade.

      - You only stand in one spot, so it can be hard to hit some enemies


      Cons:

      - Aiming the bow is weird/bad because it mainly follows the hand holding the
      bow, and it would regularly lose track from time to time or aim in a slightly
      or completely different direction. I''ve haven''t had this issue in other archery
      games.

      - Once shot, the arrow is pretty quick at the beginning of the shot, then loses
      alot of it''s speed near the end. It wasn''t fun to shoot the bow.

      - There are no in-game options to change, nor is there any menu. I can''t even
      quit the game unless I access the Oculus menu. (Oculus platforms can''t access
      the steam VR menu in games when the bottom left button is disabled, like this
      one)

      - You can''t re-centre where you are in-game, and there are no ways to rotate
      the camera so you have to rotate IRL.

      - It was quite common for the enemy remaining counter to display an extra 1
      or 2 minions even though I couldn''t find any others.

      - If you die and then start again, you''ll get this afternoon like glow that
      doesn''t go away.

      - The game did bug out on me and fully crash on me, with me having to take my
      headset off to close the game via desktop.


      Summary:

      Even though the game is sold for a very cheap price, the amount of issues annoys
      me too much, even if it was for free I wouldn''t recommend it. It''s a simple
      wave based VR Archery game held back by it''s aiming issues, bugs and lack of
      any options.'
