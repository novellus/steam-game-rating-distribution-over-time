    review: The game is good at first and even addictive, but after the first boss
      in the cave comes out a dialog box with a bat and when you try to talk to the
      npc game freezes and you have to re-enter but it still does not help, so the
      passage of the game on becomes impossible. Please fix it or just help with the
      solution of this problem.
