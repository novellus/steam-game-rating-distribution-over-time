It's one of those games where your hero falls by steps when walking down slopes instead of acting properly. And he also falls like a brick as soon as he hits ceiling. Actually, he does so even when taking pickup. Would you enjoy jumping over the pit? Chances are, you will DIE.\n\nI mean, it's already quite a \"classic DOS platformer\" that is more of puzzle with infinite lives and limites shots that carry between levels where you may get stuck. A thing of it's time. No good story, no good graphics, no music, so no art enjoyment, aha.\n\nBut on top of that it features FAST engine where the collision is out of whack, with main hero physics and interaction with level geometry being nothing shot of offending. It really is trying to place you correctly over the game field. But it's not very good at it. So you slightly sink here and there and miss the jumps.\nYea, it's a game so classic you can get stuck in a wall without speedrunning skills.\n\nAlso, based on fake science book.
