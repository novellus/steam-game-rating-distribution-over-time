    about_the_game: "<strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like\
      \ an eagle?</strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience\
      \ soaring bird flight using virtual reality.  It was originally designed for\
      \ the Oculus Rift, but has now been modified for OpenVR.\_ You embody one of\
      \ three species of eagle flying over either Northwest Scotland, a part of Columbia,\
      \ or Graham Island in British Columbia. This is designed as a relaxing soaring\
      \ flight simulation, and is not arcade-style flight, and as such you can make\
      \ use of ridge lift and thermals.  If you want a work out try flapping with\
      \ motion controllers! My Fitness tracker always thinks I'm jogging...<br><br>Proceeds\
      \ from this project go towards a major bird of prey centre in Hampshire (UK),\
      \ where I do voluntary work. Supporting this project helps towards vital conservation,\
      \ rehabilitation, and education schemes throughout the UK and overseas.  So\

    detailed_description: "<h1>YouTube Tutorials...</h1><p>... for playing with a\
      \ Gamepad or Motion Controllers are now available at the following address on\
      \ YouTube, and on the Aquila website.  These run through an introduction to\
      \ Aquila, your first flights, and more detail on take off and landing (plus\
      \ a few other bits).  Please check them out, as they will help you get started.\
      \  They are currently applicable to the Steam version, with Oculus version differences\
      \ highlighted.<br><br>While the controls vary a little with Motion Controllers\
      \ on the Steam and Oculus versions, using a Gamepad or Keyboard is the same\
      \ on both versions. All methods are also covered by basic in-game tutorials\
      \ while a Gamepad specific tutorial video is available here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3KGqLIepR8E\"\

      \ with and without VR</h1><p>This is an application that has been made with\
      \ Virtual Reality in mind, specifically using OpenVR on the Oculus Rift and\
      \ HTC Vive.  It will run without a headset connected, or via the non-vr launch\
      \ option, and has control methods added to support non-vr play. You may see\
      \ the odd reference to VR comfort, not applicable to playing without a Virtual\
      \ Reality headset of course. I can highly recommend using one for Aquila!<br><br>In\
