    about_the_game: "In a very secret laboratory, the perfect weapon was being developed.\
      \ And as a result of numerous experiments, scientists brought out a powerful\
      \ creature - the Battle Ram. And now the ram must be tested at a military training\
      \ ground. He has to fight robots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what exactly is Battle\
      \ Ram? This is a lamb that runs around the arena. The character is controlled\
      \ with the mouse. And all he can do is butt, he has no secret weapon. Actually,\
      \ this is his main and only skill. The character runs around the arena, colliding\
      \ with opponents. The musical accompaniment in the game is very cheerful and\
      \ rhythmic. The game supports Russian.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe environment in\
      \ the game can be attributed to the style of animation. You can choose the following\
      \ characteristics: puzzle, arcade, sports game, single player, difficult game.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game currently has only eight levels. Despite the small\
      \ number of levels, the game is difficult. The difficulty of the game is that\
      \ every time you lose, you start the battle from the very beginning.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe game gives quite a lot of emotions, both positive and negative.\
      \ Because the game is built according to such a scheme as &quot;easy too liarm&quot;.\
      \ That is, we easily understand the rules by which it must be passed, but it\
      \ will take a lot of time to hone the technique and pass the tests. A lot of\
      \ games on Dendy were built on the same principle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet's\
      \ consider in more detail the game by levels. The first level is training. In\
      \ the second level, opponents are trying to hit the character with bullets.\
      \ The next level is rocket, when missiles explode when hitting a player or just\
      \ hitting each other. This is a fairly simple level, because the player just\
      \ needs to dodge missiles. In the fourth level, you can be not only hit by bullets,\
      \ but also pushed out of the field, which is also considered a loss. You need\
      \ to be opponents in this level from the middle of the arena, after they have\
      \ fired shots. Level with lasers is quite easy to pass. As in the third level,\
      \ the player will need dexterity to dodge in time. In the seventh level, robots\
      \ are passive, which shoot with just one shot, but there are quite a few of\
      \ them. In the last level, a hardcore carnage begins. It involves all kinds\
      \ of robots and strikes"

    review: I love the little ram :) It's a cute and fun game, but also very difficult.
      I can only get about 2 or 3 levels completed before needing to take a break.
