    review: Copy Protection...Joystick Support is Terrible! You cant lift of and the
      manual is not a real help. The Keyboard Layout Card is missing! But the worst
      is the Sound its just bad i was sure there was a Adlib or even Roland Edition
      but it seems there wasnt!....well if you loved it as kid you might still love
      it but when you just play old games for the LETS CHECK them adventure stay away
      from it. It looks cool and has some kind of nice design but if fails to deliver.
      F19 as Example from the same year offers alot more, its just not the same scenario.
