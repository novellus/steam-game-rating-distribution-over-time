    developer_response: "Thank you for review. What you are saying is making me think\
      \ i should remove some of mechanics. I wanted to remove fish and ant completely\
      \ but it seems every person likes different chapter/mechanics. I also realized\
      \ that making less levels with more polish may be better idea. Well, endgame\
      \ was suposed to be hard :)\n\nCould i know which mechanics you like or dont\
      \ like? \n\nWhich levels were the boring ones? \n\nAnyway i really appreciate\
      \ such reviews.\n"

    review: Its a good puzzler but at times boring and hard near the end.There are
      far to many levels and that wouldn't be a problem but the game is repetitive,you
      just play sameish levels over and over again and it isn't fun at all.There are
      some very good levels and good ideas but this game mashes almost every mechanic
      from similar games and in the end its like trying tu fit an elephant into a
      car.In the final chapters games gets hard and I'm not good at these kind of
      games but I would say most people will have trouble  on some chapters.You might
      think i dislike this game...well there were moments when I really liked it,moments
      when I was bored to death and in the end this game is a mixed bag but I can
      recommend this...I think....
