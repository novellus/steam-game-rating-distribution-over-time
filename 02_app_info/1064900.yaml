    review: "I figured this would be fairly interesting but was really not ready for\
      \ how cool the total package actually is here.  \n\nOn paper it looks like a\
      \ stroll around an odd looking building but it really ends up being a story\
      \ about how a source of national pride can be stripped for parts two decades\
      \ later.   The score that plays in the background is really quite beautiful\
      \ and strolling the halls features an interesting mechanic to see the \"current\"\
      \ view of the location.  \n\nThere's a sense of tragedy and loss to this place\
      \ that I would have known nothing about if not for this title.  \n\nBut as a\
      \ bonus the actual countryside is one of the prettiest things I've seen in VR\
      \ yet.  Plus you can smash the cafe to hell and blast a functioning grand piano\
      \ with a wine bottle gun.   And there's a helicopter you can pilot too.  I'm\
      \ not sure how a developer successfully pitched that but it controls really\
      \ well and leads to some nice vertigo inducing views.  \n\nThis isn't a game\
      \ of which anyone will rack up a 10 hour playtime, but it doesn't need to be."
