I paid $5.49 CAD so my expectations were not that high at all, but I ended up having a ton of fun. \n\n    The game consists of 2-4 players having a snowball fight (Human or AI). You start with 5 hearts each and the aim is to “kill” the other player. During a match you can use a light or heavy shot. A heavy shot being performed while holding the throw button to charge it up. The winner being the first to kill X amount of people or being the leader after the time limit is up.\n\nThis game contains 4 maps: Park, Graveyard, Castle & Mine. While they do not affect the gameplay or strategies you will find different objects to take cover behind in each. The store page boasts 30 characters to play, but 25 of those characters need to be unlocked. This isn’t a bad thing though. The character does not affect the gameplay either and from what I could tell, are completely aesthetic. \n\n    If you want to unlock everything it the game, you will need to play a minimum of 73 matches. The matches being broken down into 17 for Park, Graveyard and Castle, with the Mine level needing 22 matches to obtain the unlockables. The unlockables in the game come in the form of characters and powerups. Power ups range from grenades for higher damage to a snowman sentry which will fight the enemies for you. The matches themselves can be set from 2:00 – 20:00 and from 5 – 100 kills. \n\n    Besides the single player deathmatch modes, you can also have teamplay deathmach modes as well. I’ve only had a chance to play with one friend locally, so I can’t say if it can support a full 4 player local game or not. The settings for the team-deathmatch can be set to 2vs2 or 3vs1.\n\n    Overall, I enjoyed the characters/costumes and the gameplay was fun. For the price, I would recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1510761592,"timestamp_updated":1510761836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3oWb4N8CffeuiwE="}
