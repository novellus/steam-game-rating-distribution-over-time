    review: 'I found this on-sale in some Sci-Fi Steam section, then I googled it,
      then I got it for my friend and I and we''ve loved it. You can hardly tell it''s
      an early access game- I have played for almost seven hours without finding a
      single bug! My recommendations would be to:


      1: Add more classes and weapons. Maybe a Medic (TF2 inspired skin?) who could
      have a slightly increased self healing rate, and an ability to made some sort
      of mini tether-heal machine, like in the Medical Bay. I think that more weapons
      would also be cool, especially weapons in favor of one thing, and not the other-
      like a blowtorch. A blowtorch could be a very short-rage secondary that does
      high damage to doors and robots, but very low damage to players, or maybe a
      bomb or C4 that can deal very high damage to door and entities, maybe even the
      ship, but is a one time use item. Or maybe you can tie in the C4, blowtorch,
      add a pistol, and you could even make a demolitions expert class!


      2: Allow for more in-depth ship customization. If you could control B1/B2 patrol
      routes, where is the medical bay in your ship, or maybe even if you could choose
      what ship you commanded from a list of pre-made ships instead of just the one
      we currently have, one, that would be awesome.


      3: This kind of ties into #2, but add a a workshop where people could make a
      ship and then post it on the workshop for others to use, maybe even weapons,
      upgrades, or skins too!


      4: More gameplay. I play the game with one of my friends often, and without
      him there is not a lot to do. I think that a campaign may be a good idea, where
      you have to destroy enemy ships or protect an allied space station, and I think
      something other than a Ship-Vs-Ship gamemode would also be cool, like a few
      Frigates-Vs-Capital ship, or an Attacker-Vs-Defender.


      Overall I think that DSBS is a great game, and since it''s an Early Access game,
      it has all sorts of community ideas and developer plans that have a ton of potential,
      and I think that for $6.99 (I got it on sale for $5.59 :P) it is worth your
      money.'
