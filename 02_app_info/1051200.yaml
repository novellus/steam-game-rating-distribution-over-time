    review: 'Got this on sale....was going to play in VR but decided to start the
      game in regular-mode just to see what it was like.  It was so funny I ended
      up playing and beating the game and never actually started VR-mode.  It''s REALLY
      funny if you enjoy R&M Humor.  There is a lot of random, goofy conversation
      between enemies and you can tell that the people making this game were just
      screwing around the whole time- which I think makes it funnier.  If you are
      looking for a funny (but HIGHLY HIGHLY obscene) game or something to fill the
      void between R&M seasons- this could be your ticket.  Only took a few hours
      to beat the game and do the DLC but this would be a perfect game to come back
      to every so often to get some laughs.


      Reminded me of how great it was to watch a R&M episode for the first time.'
