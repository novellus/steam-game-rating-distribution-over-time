    review: One of the icons of the US steam to diesel transition period this is a
      superb model. It captures the lines of the prototype in all aspects. The loco
      responds well to the controls, sounds are good and the exhaust effects are as
      you would expect from an Alco.  The original model epitomises the Pennsylvania
      complete with the distinctive radio antenna which has now been made as a child
      object enabling repainters to produce versions in other liveries. A welcome
      update enhancing the value of this loco to the enthusiasts of the transition
      period. This is recommended to those enthusiasts and anyone who wants to run
      something different.
