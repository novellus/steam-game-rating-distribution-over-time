You get a blacksmith signature with anvil and all, Mechanical Bird mask outfit in blue and orange, weapons based around gears and bronze (bronze being a really under-used material in weapon skins), and the usual battle outfit ornament embossing combo. I'll say it like I've said in the past ones though, if you don't have a lot of spare income, don't get this. You won't get much of anything that's genuinely impactful on it's own other than the mask outfit that you might use on one or two characters.","timestamp_created":1608106141,"timestamp_updated":1608106141,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556110501289367676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41IymtfYCcKzSugI="}
