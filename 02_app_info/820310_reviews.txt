Also,there is one level that only contains 4 chests, not 5, which means players could stay in that area looking for the final chest indefinitely without ever finding it. And there's no indication of where the levels end, so you can and will accidentally exit levels while still searching for the remaining chests, and you'll either have the reload a previous save to return to that area or just proceed with that level being incomplete. So this has turned out to NOT be a relaxing walking simulator, but a sloppy, frustrating piece of garbage. The further you get, the more tedious it becomes, and there's really just nothing fun or enjoyable about it.","timestamp_created":1609014664,"timestamp_updated":1609021355,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v67J0PYCeP/AvQI="}
