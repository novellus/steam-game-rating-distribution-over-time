      the movement of the dental drill and mirror.<br><br><i>Dental Madness: Cavity
      Mania</i> includes three tutorials. The Drill Tutorial focuses on moving and
      rotating the dental drill, then activating the drill to eliminate cavity decay.
      The Mirror Tutorial teaches players how to move and rotate the dental mirror
      in order to spot hidden cavities. The Full Tutorial combines dental drill and
      mirror tasks. There are ten gameplay Levels in DM:CM that challenge the players
      to eliminate cavity decay locations while under a time limit. Additionally,
      a monetary system rewards players for eliminating cavity decay and punishes
      players for going over time or drilling in the wrong location. Players that
      complete a Level especially quickly or profitably can enter their name and make
      the Top Ten Leaderboard for their instance of the game. DM:CM also includes
      a Main Menu, Options, Pause Menu and Credits.'
