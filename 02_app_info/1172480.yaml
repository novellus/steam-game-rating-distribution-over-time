    about_the_game: "You'll play as Agent Louie, a highly trained Super Operative,\
      \ as you try to solve level after level, recapturing the world's stolen Ice\
      \ Cream supply. Indeed, a fiendish Doctor Melt has maliciously stolen the entire\
      \ Earth's Ice Cream supply, leaving the fair citizens to suffer the heat of\
      \ summer without respite. You've parachuted onto Doctor Melt's secret island\
      \ base, and you'll stop at nothing to serve up a dish of ice cold justice. <br\
      \ />\r\nIt won't be easy. Doctor Melt has surrounded the island with dangerous\
      \ traps, boiling lava pits, villainous minions, and confusing building architecture.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you should finish the campaign, there is also a fully featured\
      \ level editor for you! Every level in this game was created with the in-game\
      \ level editor."

    review: "I enjoy this game and recommend it to fans of proven platforming mechanics\
      \ and challenging level design.\n\nAs a game player born and raised on the platformers\
      \ of the 80's and 90's this game feels at times nostalgic, given its low-fi\
      \ creative style. However, the game's creators are lampooning the genre and\
      \ challenging the common tropes. There is a sense of humor that pervades the\
      \ game mechanics, story, and level design. The jazzy music and old-school sound\
      \ effects are particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe gameplay is a straight-up \"collect-x-things-and-reach-the-exit\"\
      . Along the way, there is an opportunity to reach optional challenges and discover\
      \ hidden areas. \"Hidden\" areas are an integral part of the required player\
      \ path as well. \nWhile there are no in-game instructions (or if they exist\
      \ I skipped them), the controls are taught to the player through text bubbles.\
      \ I scratched my head during the first hour or so of about 4-6 levels about\
      \ exactly what button does what and specifically how to enter/unlock a hidden\
      \ area. The game engine feels solid and I generally feel the mistakes I made\
      \ were my fault and I understood why.\n\nI would have liked to see a more genre-standard\
      \ ramping up of difficulty in the level design, level complexity, and introduction\
      \ of game mechanics. As I player I felt like I was immediately dropped into\
      \ level 10, instead of level 1. This may turn off some players, but this lack\
      \ of a \"textbook\" game design philosophy can be felt across the game and more\
      \ often than not is a positive and refreshing attribute of the game. Given its\
      \ relatively high difficulty, the game's mainstream appeal or kid-friendly appeal\
      \ may be limited.\n\nTechnically, the game performs well on my Windows PC with\
      \ a wired Nintendo Switch Pro controller. The collision detection, checkpoint\
      \ progress system and enemy AI are all competently handled."
