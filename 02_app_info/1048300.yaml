    review: Bought it a year and a half ago and haven't seen any significant changes
      other than a couple new songs added. Game is bland as far as VR rhythm games
      go. The music is generally mediocre and too scattered across different genres
      to consistently appeal to players. There is nothing innovative about the gameplay
      that would make this a better pick over the dozens of other rhythm games already
      out there that actually have developers that give a shit about their own games.
