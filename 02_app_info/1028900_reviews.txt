Was not initially sure of longevity, but those concerns have not eventuated.\n\nKey is getting the correct tower mix to tie in with your mazing. \n\nPlenty to think about!  Different startup mazes give great variety to tactics. Leader board keeps you focused.\n\nWould like to see some stats on initial tower damage and on upgrades.","timestamp_created":1569222269,"timestamp_updated":1569636317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518126845359802246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1569587353,"developer_response":"Hi, thank you for the review. A tower dictionary has now been added with descriptions of each tower. Not sure if detailed stats of towers are necessary however as I fear that may take away some of the fun. Still, is under consideration:)"}],"cursor":"AoJ49K7nuu0CePzd0gE="}
