      team-based puzzles and RPG elements. Far from home and with no memory of the
      apocalypse, the dwarves do what they do best - Fight, Loot and Forge. Move into
      position and work with your fellow dwarves in a real-time game of tactical leapfrog.

      class="bb_tag">THE STORY</h2><br>Cyber Forge follows a trio of cyber-enhanced
