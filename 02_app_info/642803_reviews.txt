The reason for this is because I personally would prefer if the sounds were better and if there was a bigger amount of \"licensed\" advertisement paints. There's so many nice ones on the RhB, it would be nice to have them. \n\nBut even besides that, I do recommend getting this pack.","timestamp_created":1596983913,"timestamp_updated":1596983913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4opXq6fMCc9G0mgI="}
