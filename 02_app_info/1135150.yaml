    review: A nice game for cheap. Bought for $2 CDN and I'll get that much worth
      out of it. However, there seems to be no one playing so the online portion (which
      is likely the main point of the game) is dead. They either need to adjust somethings
      so that playing it single players is more viable, or there just needs to be
      more people playing in order for this game to be really good.
