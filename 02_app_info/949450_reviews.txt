I actually had ten dreams... and then one more. What made the last one different is hard to describe in words. One just need to experience it in order to fully grasp it. As many of my dreams tend to do, it drew from the pool of my old memories - Quake III: Arena barely running on my grandfather's computer, Blade Runner on a VHS, long lost as a tear in rain, a file called matrix.avi on a CD you've just borrowed from a friend.  I would have dismissed it as another simulacra praying on my nostalgia, and there are many of those, watch out for them! But there was something more here. It did not glide smoothly over the surface, it went deeper, resonating with the memories no other dared to touch. Uncompromising, rough and contemplative. It's a dream worth dreaming if you dare. Don't be repelled by its crude form, because the form is the key to a unique experience.","timestamp_created":1586287290,"timestamp_updated":1586287517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41NOGq/ECe5P9/gE="}
