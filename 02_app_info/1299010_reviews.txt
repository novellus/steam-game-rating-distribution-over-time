It was recommended to us by a common friend. Coming from playing FPS (First Person Shooting) - this game gives me nostalgia and feeling the old school vibes with the like of Legend of Zelda. This game is easy to get used to. Controls are easy. Game is kind of addicting and challenging. It offers three difficulty levels. You need to open runes and kills monsters. You also need to avoid traps. Healing fountains are available.I haven't finished a dungeon yet but I will play it more in the weekend. \n\nGame feels classic but fresh at the same time!","timestamp_created":1596461211,"timestamp_updated":1596461211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ415ug2vMCdIuTmQI="}
