Couldn't get it to work at all. Steam said it was 'automatically installed', so presumably it should have shown up in Xplane's plugins menu. I'm pretty used to installing Xplane plugins, so I knew where to go looking for it in the directory, but it wasn't there - and nor could I find the file install it manually. The dev really needs to provide a bit of information about how to correctly install and use it under Steam - or just stop offering it for sale.","timestamp_created":1608894399,"timestamp_updated":1608894399,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oYjlzPYCd86CvQI="}
