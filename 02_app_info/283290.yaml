    about_the_game: It is a misty evening in the year of our lord 1912. The Pattersons,
      a poor but proud aristocratic family of the British nobility, and some of their
      closest friends, arrive at the castle Malachi residence of a wealthy Romanian
      Count. It is only three days until the family's eldest daughter, Rebecca, is
      to be wed to the count's son, uniting the family with the rich heritage of the
      Malachi, hopefully restoring its glory.<br><br>The only person missing is you,
      the brother of the bride, who is on your way from Stockholm, where you have
      defended the Union Jack in the noble art of fencing in the Olympics. You are
      to arrive later during the evening.<br><br>Sir Patterson is disappointed when
      the Count himself doesn't greet the family at their arrival, but still he lets
      the servants show them all to their rooms, without complaining too loudly. It
      is not until later--when the doors are slammed shut and locked behind them,
      that he realizes his mistake that they have become prisoners and are at the
      Count's mercy...<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Highly intense, first-person shooter,

    review: '- bad combat mechanics, glitches


      + AWESOME atmosphere (unique, beautiful old-school horror movie visuals, great
      soundtrack, sound-fx)

      + good difficulty, not too hard for casual players (after a somewhat rough start)

      + good replayability (rooms, loot, monsters are partially randomised, and you
      want to save more family members)


      Recommended for horror- / vampirefans, as well as people who enjoy an artful
      atmosphere.

      Less optimal for people who primarily care about a perfectly worked out gameplay.
