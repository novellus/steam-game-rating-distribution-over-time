      aims to be something different, an unique gaming experience where you feel a
      part of the world and can actually relate to it in many aspects. To achieve
      that, many design choices that may appear odd at first were built upon. These
      are what shape the game and make it stand out from other similar titles. Without
      spoiling much, one of the first things you will notice is that there is no game
      menu, or that you find yourself dying a lot! Don't panic, it is all as intended.
      Just keep at it!<br>Resuming, you'll either love it or hate it (or both). But
      if you can manage to reach the end, you will, hopefully, reminisce it as a gratifying
      walk. Now, what will you do?<br><br><i>Your journey begins...</i>
