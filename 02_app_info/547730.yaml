    developer_response: Thank you for your honest criticism, I wish someone had said
      this stuff while it was still in development. For the record, Studio JAW is
      only one person, me. I am not a pedophile, and the people I have dated have
      all been people who are all consenting adults. Nor do I condone in the acts
      of pedophilia.

    review: "[h1]tl;dr the creator of this game is openly a pedophile and made a terrible\
      \ touhou clone[/h1]\n\n[b]FULL REVIEW:[/b]\nI played this game. I beat this\
      \ game. I have all the achievements. It's bad. Very bad. Can I just talk about\
      \ how this game is 1GB when the official touhou games are around 500mb? How\
      \ do you have a game that uncompressed? The music is actual ear cancer and uses\
      \ the free sound fonts given to you in any trial version of FL Studio. It's\
      \ the kind of music I'd make at 3am when I just want to goof around in FL for\
      \ a couple minutes. \n\n[b]So, the gameplay:[/b]\nIt's a bad touhou ripoff.\
      \ The HUD is very cluttered for a bullet hell game. It takes up more than half\
      \ of the screen and fills it full of useless information which is ridiculous.\n\
      Projectiles that fly out from the HUD? Yep.\nUnavoidable spell cards? Yep.\n\
      Lack of hit sounds so you don't know if you're dealing damage? Yep.\nBombs that\
      \ don't function properly? Yep.\nMy own projectiles targeting off screen, making\
      \ power-ups unobtainable? Yep.\nBackgrounds that have so much noise that the\
      \ projectiles blend into it? Yep.\nBugs? Yeah, they're there. I killed a boss\
      \ and I got killed in the results screen. Very cool.\n\n[b]The story:[/b]\n\
      Cute hand puppet thing that throws me back to old school deviantart. Not good\
      \ by any means, but nostalgic I guess. Story blows but I was curious in a \"\
      it's so bad I can't look away\" thing. Writing is atrocious and using text emoticons\
      \ is not cute. Anyway, I went to the creator's website as I was curious how\
      \ deep this story goes. Found a .pdf \"art book\" that I started reading. The\
      \ art style and the way the creator role-plays as the characters gives me big\
      \ Chris-Chan vibes. I found some pretty alarming things in the pdf as well.\
      \ There were references to guro and pedophilia which the creator tries to justify\
      \ as a normal thing.\n[quote=Studio JAW] 2/1/2016: \u5C0F\u5150\u6027\u611B\
      \ (Shouniseiai - Pedophilia)\nTime for a tough topic. This one is pretty clich\xE9\
      \ and controversial (I apparently can\u2019t type in\nfrench). But it\u2019\
      s about pedophilia in Japan. On the light side of it, as a positive explanation\
      \ for\nit, it\u2019s parents wanting what\u2019s best for their children. [/quote]\n\
      \n[quote=Studio JAW] 3/19/2016: \u30B4\u30A2 (Goa - Gore)\nYou ever wonder sometimes\
      \ if these horror movies ever get it right? How much blood\ncan possibly spray\
      \ out of someones neck if their head is chopped off?[/quote]\n\nPretty alarming\
      \ things. I'll leave a link [url=https://idb.studiojaw.com/StoryHiresPC.pdf]here[/url]\
      \ as well.\n\nAll in all, not a good game by a game studio that has an open\
      \ pedo in it. Refunded. Those achievements stain my profile forever.\n\n\u2764\
