You're not here for the graphics anyway, but for the puzzles. I like how this game ramps slowly - showing you how to use opening chests as a way to \"skip\" a turn and get the baddies close to your sword. One thing to remember is that to complete a level you just have to get all the chests, not kill all the baddies. I struggle with a few levels until I realized I could just let the baddies chase me around the map while I moved to get the chest.  I have only a few nitpicks \n1) if I hold down the arrow, it should let me keep moving after a second or so. Always tapping is bothersome.\n2) if the only thing left in a level is open the chests ( all baddies dead ) let me just click a \"complete\" button to skip all the tapping I have to do to get the chests\n3) having even just a touch of story would be nice. why am I here out killing snakes and stuff?","timestamp_created":1607285494,"timestamp_updated":1607285494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj8rrnPYCdd/qtwI="}
