It's just 1 dollar/euro anyway. If you really want a specific skin and cannot buy it otherwise, spare yourself a coffee some day and get it.\n\nbesides from addressing such critiques, let's speak of the skin itself: I like it. It reminds me of Roadhog from Overwatch in his Militia skin. Usually dressed in a crazy and unsuitable way, but shows some para-military decency with the right skin. That's why I like it, it dresses Salvador for war. The game might be all humour and absurd, but I like being realistic.","timestamp_created":1609128351,"timestamp_updated":1609128351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433656930923461914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40cLh0/YCdOX9vQI="}
