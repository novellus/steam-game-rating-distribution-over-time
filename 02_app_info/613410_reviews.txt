Take, for example, the character’s skills are shown in round button (I literally want to touch my monitor to cast the spell), but instead you figure out you should press 3, 4, 5, 6 on your keyboard. Same thing goes to the menu and all the sub menu.\n\nThe graphics, judging from a PC game point of view, looks weird to me in a way that even though the surroundings, characters, and enemies are all in one screen, there isn’t many interactions between them, and it gives me the feeling of stiffing when it comes to the combat system. It is further penalized by the poor/low frame drawing; the animation is not smooth.\n\nI do want to say that I only played this game for only 10 mins in scenario mode, however it should give me a rough idea what I am getting into. I will probably consider playing on an ipad but definitely not on a pc.","timestamp_created":1497572556,"timestamp_updated":1577512992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.338032931089401245","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0L/Gpe8Cfd3oew=="}
