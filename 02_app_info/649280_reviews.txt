There is a sudden spike of difficulty - I noticed it around Ivy Bloom and had to change my approach for Nikita - that marks a focus away from engaging bounty targets individually towards attacking them with warfleets in tow. You WILL need Warfleets for the last two, because they have millions of HP. I have emptied the magazines of a Tzar class carrier at them and still had to wait several minutes for my turrets and the 70k+ fleet to pound them down into oblivion. I suppose you could call it a hard fight, but I actually liked the challenging individual opponents of the first nine bounties more. \n\nYour reward for going through all this is a VERY nice ship, the Deadly Perun, and potentially getting the blueprints to it, enabling you to use it for your fleets (better fleet point value for supercapital point than any other carrier, or dreadnaught for that matter. Not a HUGE difference, but nice). Supposedly there might be a warmaster involved in the other option, but I can't confirm this and can't really seeing it play out that way, story-wise. It seems more of a \"here's some money\" option, and by the time you can actually tackle the final few bounties, money will have long ceased to be of any use to yo, nevermind a measly few million.\n\nThere are two other ships included in the DLC, buyable at HQ for the low low price of 110 million each. The Deadly Helios is an aggressive dreadnaught with a double hangar and weakish shields but excellent gun placement and a cool, unique look. Worth checking out. The Deadly Premonition is a completely overpowered carrier that is so ugly as to be downright offensive. Both are callbacks to ships from the previous game in the series.\n\nOverall, a nice chunk of content, nothing super major, but well-done and worth the price, especially if on sale.","timestamp_created":1606653703,"timestamp_updated":1606653703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tb6BivYCf++WtQI="}
