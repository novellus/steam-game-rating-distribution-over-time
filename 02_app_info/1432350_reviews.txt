This is the first title from this developer. Is it worth your time?\n\nThe puzzle part was done poorly and unimaginatively. No challenge at all and barely any variation.  If simple swapping of tiles with maximum of 16 pieces sounds boring to you then we agree. Even for this minimal price I have higher expectation than that. The number of puzzles is also disappointing.\nThe devs were so lazy that there aren't even any options. You can't change the volume or display mode. I would almost require more effort to make game more bare than this.\n\nMy guess is that most of the money went into art. This is my main reason for trying such products. Unfortunately the art is barely average and uneven. The number of pictures is more or less fine considering the price but quality is below standard of similar titles. Plenty games with worse art but it's easy to find better than this for same price.\n\nMusic is of the elevator variety. Matches the overall quality of the product. Doesn't irritate but that's about it.\n\nNo bugs encountered.\n\nOverall, we're dealing here with a very simplistic puzzle with some average art and music. Even for such low price you should expect more than this. Can't recommend: 3/10","timestamp_created":1609844255,"timestamp_updated":1609844636,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlveN6fYCf5HVwAI="}
