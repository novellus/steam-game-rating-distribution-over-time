    review: "[h1]Well written superhero-esque rather linear story[/h1]\nI really loved\
      \ the idea of possessing other characters and in a few cases this games does\
      \ some cool things with that mechanic. Mostly however, it plays like a somewhat\
      \ generic superhero story, with the other characters being more powerful than\
      \ you. There is a some amount of choice in who to possess (and how to create\
      \ your character), yet these things don't  really change the plot or even your\
      \ interaction with other significant characters (mostly only some small subplots\
      \ change). The story is fairly concise and linear, giving a somewhat limited\
      \ replay value, yet there are some different paths to explore.\n\nOn a more\
      \ positive note, the individual pieces of the story are well written and quite\
      \ action packed. It feels like you having experienced an action movie with a\
      \ relevant amount of choice at the end of the game\n\nFor context, this is the\
      \ first choice of games game I have finished, but I have played a few similar\
      \ (mostly free) games. To my knowledge it seems games from choice of games have\
      \ an emphasis on stats resulting in partly set paths (such as encouraging/discouraging\
      \ violence depending on your initial \"build\"). ORPHEUS Ruse partly steers\
      \ away from this by offering a sligthly more linear story yet retains stats\
      \ as a relevant factor that limits choice in some instances. \n\nThe game took\
      \ me 2 hours on my first playthrough and seems like it might offer about 2-3\
      \ interesting playthroughs with somewhat different paths\n\nAll in all I'll\
      \ give the title a weak recommendation, yet I would caution anyone considering\
      \ this game solely for the premise of being able to control other people (as\
      \ it doesn't play a truly significant part in the story).\n7/10"
