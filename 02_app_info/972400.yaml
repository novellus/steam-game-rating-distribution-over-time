    review: 'EDIT:


      The DLC isn''t actually "Broken". It just doesn''t come ready to use as you
      may expect. You will have to manually change the input to accommodate your keyboard
      or controller, which you''d only know how to do if you were a veteran PGMMV
      user.



      ------------------------------------------------------------



      PGMMV is an amazing engine but this sample game is broken.


      The Dot Robot test game seems to be an intuitive example of putting together
      a game with PGM. Unfortunately the sample game is broken.


      1. On the Robot Select screen, you have one option to select and it is a Red
      Robot, but you actually play as a blue robot.


      2. All key inputs seems to function as normal until the player actually gains
      control in the game, and then the only input that works is the shoot button.
      Cannot jump, move or do anything else. Checked the code to see if I was hitting
      the right buttons, and I was. The input keys that are programmed for player
      use do nothing. Checked my install, checked my setting, tried with a controller.
      No changes.


      3. Can''t read Kanji. =('
