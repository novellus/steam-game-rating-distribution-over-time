      notes: 'Hellbound: the Awakening is a hack and slash video game, that takes
        a player onto a journey to Hell, to battle the dark lord himself, and his
        army.  Some of the attacks and special abilities, that both the player and
        enemies wield, will be depicted in a 2D graphical violence, with blood and
        gore.  For example, enemies might explode or limbs might fly off.  Also, some
        of the location settings, especially Hell, is depicted in a 2D graphical gore
        style, with the intension of leaving an unsettling feeling.  Corpses, as well
        as, the suffering damned, are plentiful in those relevant stages.'
