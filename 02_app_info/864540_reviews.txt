[/b]\nThats  a quote from my friend after he watched me play this game for a little. Its not surprising though because if you only play the game once, the first hour is absolute dookie. Your character is ridiculously slow, weak, squishy, and talentless. Only after an hour of playing will you have amassed the needed in game currency to upgrade your base stats (and they affect all classes). After this point, the game quickly begins picking up pace and by hour 2 you'll be glad you paid the meager asking price for this experience. \nAre there issues? Hell yeah there are. The game doesnt run all that smoothly, the maps can be confusing and a bit repetitive in their layouts, the combat feels a bit clunky, and the game is extremely unfriendly to beginners. But underneath the apparent jank, there is a really awesome experience. Notably, I really like the general movement and navigation. Its a 2.5D game so you side scroll and move vertically, but you also change you path in the third dimension at points as well. This is all tied together with a nice jetpack and ledge-grab system which allows for some nice exploration. I do wish the combat played into this flying system more for all the characters instead of just a few. \nIt's got all of your usual rogue-like staples, so if you're into the genre I really do think this is a game that deserves at least an hour of your time to see what its got. If you dont like it, just return it. \nIf you're not into the genre, I still do give it a recommendation. Just be aware that its got some niche appeal and the frustrating difficulty might be offputting at first.","timestamp_created":1609562773,"timestamp_updated":1609562773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44Nra4PYCcILPvwI="}
