    short_description: ODA is a retrowave-style puzzle platformer. It's smart and
      unusual. Can it change your perception of space, time and your own life? Hopefully
      not. But it can enrich your perception of space, it can challenge you with quite
      unusual swap-mechanics.

    review: "So. I was the one of those who developed this game for GMTK Jam. And\
      \ I was proud what the game was spotlighted there. But I left the development\
      \ team and now I was excited to check how the game goes. I like the pros/cons\
      \ type of comment so I'll do the same.\n\nPros: \n[list]\n[*] Hard puzzles.\
      \ Or I'm not too smart for it. \n[*] Visual style. Especially the background.\
      \ \n[*] The ball gun behavior. It's fun to play with it. \n[*] Early access.\
      \ So the game will be improved.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list] \n[*] It looks like\
      \ there might be more sounds. I really miss some step or jump noises.\n[*] Gamepad\
      \ support. Maybe, there is a way to make it work but I didn't find it. \n[/list]\n"
