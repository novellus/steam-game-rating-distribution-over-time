I also love the art style and the play on Shy Guys from the Mario games. For the price this is a must buy for puzzle fans. The only think that I didn't particularly care for was the music. It sort of fits, but it's pretty bland and a bit grating if you are listening to it long term. Oh and the full screen mechanic kept messing with my computer when I would try and exit it.\n\nOverall it's a short and sweet with a story and characters that left me wanting more, which is always a good sign for an up and coming indie developer. Awesome job!","timestamp_created":1601283612,"timestamp_updated":1601283612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1pv86fQCfojMpAI="}
