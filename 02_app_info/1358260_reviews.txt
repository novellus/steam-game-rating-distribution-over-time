However, the town...breaks once you build a wooden house. You are no longer able to see those who are petitioning in your throne room. Additionally, trading is a bit jank. You are required to have an upgrade for the Armory in order to trade more than like two or three times with other realms. Most of the tier two buildings are locked behind stone, and while I haven't played super far into the game to figure out what stone harvesting research is needed. Being raided on day 3 for most of your gold reserves is very obnoxious but I do understand that stuff happened alot during the time period. The early game very slow as you only trickle in one gold per day. \n\nThat being said, it looks like this game can grow to something bigger. The ability to train your ruler is nice, although I have no idea how that effects your realm as of yet, other than arbritrary petiioning events.","timestamp_created":1607381222,"timestamp_updated":1607381222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607393870,"developer_response":"A couple things, we just released an update to handle the throne issue among other initial release bugs. Your skills are used in battle, tournaments, relation building with kingdoms and courting as well as the petitions like you mentioned. Thanks for the review. Quick hint, build defensive buildings to reduce raids frequency and amount stolen"}],"cursor":"AoJwp+DYn/YCdNWIuAI="}
