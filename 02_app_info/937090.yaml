    review: 'The core gameplay is quite good. It''s a chill game and I don''t know
      of others like it. The stacking feels good and the theme is nice. There are
      gameplay settings and some alternative modes after the campaign too. I would
      definitely recommend this one.


      The issue I had was performance. On my 1080ti (Index running at 80hz) I was
      reprojecting. There is one graphics setting, HD or SD, which does fix it but
      it would be nice to be able to tweak shadows or some other setting to get a
      steady framerate rather than lowering the resolution.'
