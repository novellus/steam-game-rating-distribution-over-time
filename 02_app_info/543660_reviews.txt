I have to unlock everything again. A first word problem, yeah still, it's worth notifying. \n\nNow, if I understand well, this pack automatically unlocks free hovercars . Cool. \n\nBut it could have been cooler to actually make these car behave differently because of that trait, instead of just removing the wheels on the sprite of the regular cars and slightly tweaking the perfs. There is still much potential for this game, both for the team to make money, and for the fun playing! I really would want the devs to consider bringing us more DLC...\n\nPS: I'm still waiting for my DLC with thematic tracks ;) \n(--> examples given in my review for the main game).","timestamp_created":1486970385,"timestamp_updated":1486971541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44KKam9oCc7CEcg=="}
