    review: 'forgot how difficult this game can be, which is not the bad thing about
      it. I love this game and if I still had a working controller for my ps2 I would''ve
      never bought this port. This port is terrible and its been years and they haven''t
      fixed anything. There''s still no cloud saving, controller still don''t work
      officially and even with the fix you can do it still barely works, keybinds
      seem to reset themselves randomly, and my quicksaves just disappeared sometimes.


      If you can avoid this port, do it. If that''s not an option i guess get this
      on sale.'
