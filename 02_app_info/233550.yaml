    review: 'I remember I couldn''t complete this game when I was child. Apparently,
      I was a particularly stupid child as I couldn''t even get past the first scene
      where you have to run away from the beast! It''s funny, I always remembered
      the game though. There is something weird and beautiful about the low-pixel
      art style and the design of the world; I was always intrigued to know what was
      going on!


      So I''ve returned to complete the game as an adult, and I have to say that there
      are some extremely un-intuitive puzzles in there, it made me feel a little less
      bad for how little I managed to complete when I was younger! I would say that
      the art style holds up remarkably well and would recommend going through it
      if you''re a fan of modern games like Limbo and Inside and want to experience
      a classic of that genre.'
