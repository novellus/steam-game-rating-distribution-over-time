      enemy equipment. <br />

      To do this, you can build 3 types of automatic turrets, which have their own
      unique characteristics and use different<br />

      ways to destroy the enemy. But do not forget to upgrade your turrets, then they
      will cause more damage and continue to shoot! <br />

      <br />

      Fierce battles take place in 15 unique locations, ranging from urban areas to
      spacious suburbs. <br />

      Many game elements, including enemy routes, are randomly generated and give
      a unique experience from each game. <br />

      <br />

      Earn money by destroying enemies. They can buy the unwinding time to build new
      turrets or to upgrade old ones. <br />

      Careful study of the features of locations and types of enemies will teach on
      the move to make the right decisions. <br />

      <br />

      Peculiar properties: <br />

      <br />

      - &quot;Rewind&quot; time ago! But it only works on enemies, and you will have
      time to destroy them! <br />

      - Create unique turrets to defend your city! <br />

      <br />

      - Different levels of difficulty <br />

      <br />

      - 22 types of enemy vehicles with their unique characteristics <br />

      <br />

      <br />

      Build the perfect defense! Keep them coming! Don''t give up until the last!'

    short_description: City Defense is a tower defense game. The enemies decided to
      blitzkrieg and a small town turned out to be the line of attack. Build automatic
      turrets to destroy enemy equipment, pump them, and earn money for the victory
      over each enemy, because only with a sly strategy and cold mind you can win
      this battle.
