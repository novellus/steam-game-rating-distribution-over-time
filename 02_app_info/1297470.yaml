    about_the_game: Inconsistencies is an immersive psychological-horror experience
      played from the ego perspective. You play as the young private investigator
      Sally Harrison as she explores an old lodge to uncover the mysterious, inter
      generational double suicide of the Rethan family. You collect interesting clues,
      combine objects and solve complex puzzles. An exciting and unique story that
      will change based on your decisions awaits!<br><br>The game concentrates on
      exploring the environment and gathering information, which slowly builds up
      the atmosphere. The story is told through subtle environmental details and surreal
      insights of the gathered information. The decisions you make are all final and
      will significantly influence the story, which will create multiple storylines
      and endings. Death is also a major aspect of the game. Through a lot of hidden
      objects and different endings a high replay value is achieved.<h2 class="bb_tag">Environment</h2>You
      are investigating the family home of the Rethans, an old lodge near a lake,
      far away from civilisation. It's an eerie house that holds many secrets and
      dangers. You wander through dark corridors and investigate strange rooms while
      your head fills with the dark memories and experiences of the former inhabitants.<br>    <br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>The double suicide of Arthur and Marilyn Rethan
      made the rounds in all the newspapers a few decades ago, but now their son James
      and his wife were also found dead. It appears that they too committed suicide.
      The inter generational double suicides, from now on known as Rethan cases, are
      one of the most mysterious and unexplained cases in the career of the young
      private investigator Sally Harrison, who has now been assigned to solve the
      cases. As a player, you will uncover parts of the dark past and each new clue
      will scare and frighten you. It's up to you to find out the truth. But will
      you run away or will you try everything to uncover what happened?<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
      mechanics</h2>In Inconsistencies you are absolutely on your own. With no weapons
      to help you, you have to fight the strange incidents with your mind alone. By
      solving complex puzzles and finding clues, you will gain more and more information
      about what really happened in the house. Your decisions to deal with certain
      situations also have a major impact on the game. It is quite possible that you
      will miss many of the decisive clues if you don't pay attention to the small
      details.<br>   <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1297470/extras/mini_screenshot2.png?t=1591347972"
      /><br>   <br>Your psyche becomes weaker and weaker as you surrender to your
      fears. You have to face the dangers of the past or run the risk of going insane
      forever. Only if your mind remains as healthy as possible, you can decipher
      the secrets of the house and solve the Rethan case.<br>   <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1297470/extras/gif1.gif?t=1591347972"

      Ambientazione suggestiva e immersiva con ottimo sonoro e grafica dettagliata\
