I really do.  But the controls and the lack of modern standards make me give it a no.\nIf you have a controller, you can only use the data pad.  On KB arrows to move, \"l\" to fire.  No remapping to anything that makes sense.\nYou can hold down on ladders to go down but have to repeat the up button on each level to go up.  Getting off on a specific floor going down is very tricky.  Getting onto a ladder from above is also very tricky.  You might think you are in the right spot.  But be off by a pixel and you will be standing there getting shot instead of dropping.\nYou can not adjust sound or volume levels so far as I can tell.\nThe gameplay (outside of frustrating controls) is pretty cool.  Sort of a cross between \"Donkey Kong\" and Intellivisions \"Night Stalker.\"  Climb around a ladder maze.  Shoot bad guys.  Collect Ammo and O2 to avoid death.  Basic stuff but cool.\nTo me, this seems like something that needs a week more in polishing before leaving \"early access.\"","timestamp_created":1581525006,"timestamp_updated":1581525006,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52742612361907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw646PnfACceLq8QE="}
