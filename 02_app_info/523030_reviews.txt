I was hoping for a continuation of the original story, but I also respect the change to make a new version of the original story. I loved the original game and this game essentially takes the elements and design of the first game and ports it in. Still a very atmospheric game and I hope to beat it someday.\n\nI will say there is an extreme difficulty spike between this game and the first one. Also, your CPU teammates are useless.","timestamp_created":1516477331,"timestamp_updated":1596060911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523346304893493652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ZipzvMCcI/TlgE="}
