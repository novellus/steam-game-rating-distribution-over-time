    review: 'Despite the spartan look of Xploquest games, I like playing them. They
      are an entirely mechanical RPG experience, and while the fights are fast, the
      level advancement is leisurely paced. The challenge is how much do you push
      your luck of advancing? And the game gives some nice areas to explore, such
      as quest locations and ruins.


      Technically, I played this game on Ubuntu Linux 18.04, with radeon mesa drivers.
      It has a 11MB install size, and plays without fullscreen mode. Due to a GM2
      game engine issue, the original game failed to start for a while, but the developer
      was extremely patient in forum responses. That ensured that Xploquest 2 went
      on my wishlist. I have not had any other issues with this sequel.


      I hope the developer adds some user-interface features, because it is tricky
      to get started. While sometimes there is a ? that provides help, most of the
      UI is not labelled. It would be helpful having a some tutorial pages, from the
      main menu. Also, it might be interesting to have beastiary information on the
      monsters, perhaps even to learn their weaknesses.


      Xploquest is a quick RPG for people looking to do some quick combat and levelling
      up. It has polished underlying mechanics, despite the shockingly simple graphics.
      It is not going to be for everybody, but I highly recommend it to people who
      enjoy board game experiences.


      (Update: the last fifth of the game really gets bogged-down, in the pace of
      gameplay. Each fight becomes a mess of mouseclicks. This later part of the game
      is an extension from the first Xploquest, and it did not get the same quality
      play-testing. Too bad, because that part of the game introduces a couple puzzle
      elements. The fight sequences are just a slog and they are not fun. However,
      I had 8+ hours of fun gameplay before I got to that later part of the game.)'
