This computer version is the same so I am very happy.\nThere is lots to do and many mini games to play. Some of them are quite hard since they are based on quick reactions and timed events, although they are very fun. \nThe whole designing the theme park is so much fun, from making unique roller coasters to cleaning up trash and setting up people. \nThere is endless playtime within this game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes casual yet busy games. It is quite relaxing yet challenging. Perfect for keeping busy with.","timestamp_created":1610029698,"timestamp_updated":1610029698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvfHP7vYCf76kwQI="}
