    about_the_game: "Harold Black\u2019s Journal, a collection of anatomical sketches,\
      \ scientific observations and psychological evaluations, constitute most of\
      \ what the AHA know about their enemy. Black received little success until later\
      \ in life, when a chance assignment sent it spiraling down a different path.\
      \ His hodgepodge education, acquired on many walks of life, gave him the unique\
      \ ability to see connections no one else could, and see reason where others\
      \ only saw madness."

    review: "If you are looking for PvE mode with your friends forget it, all you\
      \ can get is trials mode some kind of challenges, the real fun are in bounty\
      \ hunter that you can do only in PvP mode.\n\nPvE players also spend money into\
      \ your game, and would spend even more:\n\nPurchased: Dec 28 @ 3:07am\nHunt:\
      \ Showdown - \nHunt: Showdown - Legends of the Bayou -\nHunt: Showdown - Llorona\u2019\
      s Heir - \nHunt: Showdown - The Phantom - \nHunt: Showdown - Last Gust - \n\
      Hunt: Showdown - The Rat - \nHunt: Showdown - The Researcher - \nHunt: Showdown\
      \ - Fire Fight - \nHunt: Showdown - Zhong Kui - \nHunt: Showdown - Crossroads\
      \ - \nHunt: Showdown - The Arcane Archaeologist - \nHunt: Showdown - The Revenant\
      \ - \nHunt: Showdown - Louisiana Legac\n\nFor now no more money from me into\
      \ this game and it  will be on the ice like Read Dead Redemption 2 (awaiting\
      \ for one day) it have a private lobby so we can have fun with friends."
