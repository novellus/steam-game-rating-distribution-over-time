    review: 'Woo eeh! That hydra mini game is hard but in the way that makes you wanna
      keep going until you''ve smashed your monitor.

      If you''re in for a challenge the single will give it to you in spades, with
      a thumping techno soundtrack to get you pumped for each attempt.

      Versus mode is a fast and wild, reflecting a shot into your opponents face and
      having them try to block only to realise it''s an unblockable bullet and gasp
      in horror as their little alien explodes into dust, is something to experience.

      Great game, would buy again! (y)'
