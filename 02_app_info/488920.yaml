    review: 'Will It VR?: Yes, by TKO.


      Yes, this is Punch Out for VR. If that appeals to you, you''re in luck. If that
      doesn''t appeal to you, why not?


      Knockout League does exactly what the screenshots tell you it''s trying to do.
      It recreates the reactive, puzzle-like boxing action of Punch Out in VR, and
      it does it exceptionally well. You''ll start out with the easy guys (and gals
      - the game is refreshingly gender inclusive), and work your way up to the heavy
      hitters. Each fighter has a unique style, and as you learn their tells, you''ll
      figure out the best way to avoid their blows and attack in response. Get it
      right and you''ll get a chance to lang a few hits before going back on the defensive.
      Mix up your swings for better results, and pay attention to direction.


      The characters are great, the production value is high, and your trainer definitely
      feels like a throwback to Doc Louis. You''ll work up a sweat and have fun doing
      it (the game will even count calories burned if you want it to).
