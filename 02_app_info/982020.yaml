    about_the_game: "Eurobi Racing is a simplistic &quot;run&quot; type game where\
      \ you aim to get as far as you can. The game gets increasingly difficult as\
      \ time passes, and puts your reactions to the ultimate test. Once unlocked,\
      \ upgrades will greatly help in getting you farther than ever before, and will\
      \ make the later levels of the game a little easier (on your soul).<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n     Look forward to additions, including but not limited to: Coop\
      \ and Versus modes, full soundtrack, new power-ups and mechanics, several new\
      \ playable vehicles and maps, and (hopefully) a mobile version using touch controls.\
      \ I will also be working closely with community input and suggestions to make\
      \ this first game of mine not only<br />\r\nsomething I can be proud of, but\
      \ something players can see grow and change based on their own feedback. I'm\
      \ also excited to admit I have multiple other projects currently in progress.\
      \ I plan to continue working on them after I can officially take this out of\
      \ early access, so be sure to look forward to those as well... Cheers!"

    short_description: Eurobi Racing is a simple and addictive time killing game.
      Upgrade your vehicle and power-ups to maximize high-scores, purchase new cars,
      and compete against others! Be prepared to run into law enforcement, wonky crash
      physics, and buggy sound effects.
