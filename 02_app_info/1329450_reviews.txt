I was able to progress fairly quickly being as I'd played many \"match 3\" type games on FB, which I've sworn off of. It was really fun, a nice escape, however, after about the 40th level, knowing not to be tempted by the \"try it now\" bonuses, I had to. Then, I couldn't progress any further unless I PURCHASED power-ups/bonuses. I even tried going way back to gain additional points from levels where I didn't get the full 3 stars, nothing. I kept playing, but once you reach a level where you can't possibly pass without buying \"extras\", it's no fun. I might've paid a small fee upfront to play the game without requiring additional purchases, but at level 70, I'm pretty much done and have NO interest in purchasing items with REAL $ (instead of points)  to pass levels.","timestamp_created":1608004759,"timestamp_updated":1608004759,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43a2jsvYCerCrugI="}
