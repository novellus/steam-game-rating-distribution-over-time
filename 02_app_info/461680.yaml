    about_the_game: <strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a SIMULATOR, the drone handling
      and physics are very closely matched to <strong>real life</strong>, flying a
      racing drone is <strong>NOT easy</strong>. If you have no helicopter or multirotor
      flight experience then this program will be extremely dificult and frustrating,
      you have been warned. <br><br>That said, if a new player did ever manage to
      develop the coordination required to fly this simulator competently they could
      be sure that those skills would translate into the real world. To go from no
      experience to some level of control takes hours of attempts.<br><br>Racing drones
      are almost always hand built craft which can vary greatly in size, weight, thrust,
      acceleration, control delay, PID tuning and rates. So if you have real life
      flight experience it's highly unlikely that the default configuration of this
      simulation will match up with your experiences. This simulator should offer
      you all the settings you need to tweak the game's physics into something that
      does match the handling of your real life racing drone very closely. <br><br>Experience
      the rush of FPV racing and even develop real life drone flight skills with the
      life-like physics found in this sim. If you already have drone racing experience,
      this sim supports many Radio Controllers and will enable you do develop skills
      on new challenging courses. If you're just starting out, the game also supports
      common gamepads and joysticks to get you started.<br>Never got bogged down flying

      Old review

      __________________________________________________________________________

      Well until now this game looks very good and make fun to play. I hope it will
      get optimization and new stuff soon and dont end as graveyarded EA game.


      (Im going to update this review if necessary)


      @Update1 05.13.2016

      The game does make a very good progress and the developer communicate very much
      with the players, listen to suggestions and fix the bugs that the players post
      about. Also there are game updates every few days. Thumbs up! Keep it up.


      Game support so far 10/10'
