    review: 'A simple twin stick shooter where you grind for coins to buy crates that
      give random perks, weapons and/or gems.


      The Con''s -

      There''s no story or interaction between characters.

      There is only one map.

      There is only one mode.

      There are no other objectives other than unlocks.


      The Pro''s +

      Smooth controls.

      Frantic gameplay.

      Crisp sprites and assets.

      A wide variety of weapons and perks.



      Overall a very hollow experience that leaves you wishing for too much more.


      What is there is great, but there''s so little there.

      If they would add DLC or update the game with extra modes/features then I would
      solidly recommend it, but that most likely will never happen.

      I hope I have to eat my words on that though.


      Sadly, not recommended. :('
