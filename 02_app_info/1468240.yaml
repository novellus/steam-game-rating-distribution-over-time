      /><br><br>Carebotz is a 2.5D, side-scroller, gravity-shooter game with a little
      metroidvania-lite style<br><br><strong>[The world]</strong> Handcrafted with
      love by sci-fi enthusiasts. A ruined factory with many secrets and unknown technologies.
      Sometimes exploration will be the key to survival.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1468240/extras/carebotz-newfeatures-2020-05-02_16-20-09_5_4.gif?t=1606217604"
      /><br><br><strong>[Story]</strong> This is not really a story-oriented game,
      but with some investigation, you may stumble upon some information about the
      factory, the enemies, and ofc. about Bibz. This little maintenance carebot is
      the protagonist of the game.<br><br><strong>[Campaign]</strong> The story mode
      has got content that should take an average player 6-8 hours to play through,
      and it also contains many secrets, caters to multiple different playstyles,
      and includes a number of different paths to take, to keep the game interesting
      through multiple replays. You will fight against groups of different enemy types,
      but you have to manage your energy level and the gravity which make your journey
      harder than you'd think.<br><br>The main task of this little bot is to keep
      things running and maintain what's left of the damaged system it's responsible
      for. The maintenance work is trivial on an average day - however that particular
      day when the main computer wakes us from our hibernation is anything but average.
      Its request is not only to resume our duties but also to find and eradicate
      the hostiles of unknown origin from the factory.<br><br><strong>[Arena]</strong>
      The game has got an endless survival arena mode with some little maps and difficulty
      levels.<br><br><strong>[Control]</strong> <u>A gamepad is not absolutly neccessary
      but strongly recommended ;)</u>
