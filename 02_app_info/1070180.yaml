    review: I would recommend this game but I must also say that half of the levels
      are repeats for the previous 5 Rescue Teams. There is a lot of play with the
      3 modes of play but if this game is not on sale I would buy one of the other
      Rescue Team games. This game should have been called "the best level repeat
      game".
