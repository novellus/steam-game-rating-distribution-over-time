    review: 'This game is certainly the black sheep of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight
      series. It follows Mara Jade, an old school EU favorite, instead of Kyle Katarn.
      The first thing you''ll notice playing this is that it''s a downgrade from the
      original Jedi Knight game. Gone are the FMV cutscenes. Instead we have in-game
      rendered cutscenes, which run at 12fps and look terrible. The gameplay is still
      up to the standard of Jedi Knight, but there are little things that drag the
      experience down. The level design is pretty good, but not as good as the previous
      games. The difficulty can spike sometimes. The lightsaber is not great. Using
      guns is much more satisfying. This isn''t really a problem until the last 3
      levels when you are limited to only using your lightsaber and force powers.
      Every encounter becomes an ordeal.


      The story isn''t much to write home about. I like the character of Mara Jade,
      but she wasn''t utilized very well. Also, what is this game about exactly? You''re
      just sort of doing random missions until Kyle Katarn is tempted by the dark
      side.


      If you''re a fan of the series, it''s definitely worth playing. If you are looking
      to get into the series, start with one of the other games first.'
