    about_the_game: "This German minibus, in production since 1995, was created to\
      \ meet various needs, such as comfortable passenger transportation and cargo\
      \ transportation. Produced with different chassis, it can be used as a minibus,\
      \ van, refrigerated vehicle or special-purpose vehicle (ambulance, mobile office\
      \ etc.).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features the second generation of the minibus,\
      \ announced in Europe in 2006. At that time, the vehicle received chrome grilles,\
      \ massive bumpers, new headlights, redesigned wheel cases and larger air intakes,\
      \ resulting in a more robust appearance. In addition, electronic stability control\
      \ (ESC), hydraulic power steering and electric windows were introduced. The\
      \ most powerful version of the engine has a 3.5-liter capacity and 285 HP (210\
      \ kW) of power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe European Minibus was exported to 136\
      \ countries."
