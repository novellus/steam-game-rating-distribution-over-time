That hydra mini game is hard but in the way that makes you wanna keep going until you've smashed your monitor.\nIf you're in for a challenge the single will give it to you in spades, with a thumping techno soundtrack to get you pumped for each attempt.\nVersus mode is a fast and wild, reflecting a shot into your opponents face and having them try to block only to realise it's an unblockable bullet and gasp in horror as their little alien explodes into dust, is something to experience.\nGreat game, would buy again!
