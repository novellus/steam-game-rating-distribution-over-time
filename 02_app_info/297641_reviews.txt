There's only one Female Hero and a Sorceress. The Wizard sounds like an old man, and the rest are evil voices.\nAside from the Evil Villain voices (the third I actually liked), they just lack emotion, It sounds like someone read them while rolling their eyes - they just weren't into it. I won't lie that some made me chuckle, but I won't use 3/4 of the samples. Might have been better if there were more variety of female/male as well.\n","timestamp_created":1514594492,"timestamp_updated":1514594492,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ru30uACfYqVlAE="}
