The suit aliens are broken, boasting stupid stats. You try to apply knowledge [i]the base game taught you[/i] where you survive if you take full cover and the enemy is far but these enemies not only have perfect accuracy but extremely high crit chance, and almost always take more than one attack to kill. The poison attack does not seem to be able to miss at all and that requires to bring tons of medkits to the mission to avoid slow but certain death of a team member. The missions are handed out early in the game where i dont yet have upgraded weapons. It was completely possible to prioritize unlocking upgraded weapons but I could not know beforehand about the cringe that was about to come.\nThe misssions are annoyingly, putridly difficult for someone playing the game for the first time, they smell. Do not have this DLC enabled for your first playthrough and while you're at it, you might aswell forget about it altogether. The cat's dcik worth of content that it introduces to the game is probably not worth the money and nerves anyway","timestamp_created":1604515405,"timestamp_updated":1604515405,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.43754848837852478","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zMOkyvUCceumrAI="}
