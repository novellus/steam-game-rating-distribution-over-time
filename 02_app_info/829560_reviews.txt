It’s a walking sim first person kinda game, but it has little space exploration like yer Gone Homes and Firewatches. And it is a game about relationships where u don’t get to talk or choose lines or even… see an actual conversation between two characters, that goes back and forth. And at first my instinct was to keep my guard up about that, because these are genres I really like and its best traits were kinda… taken away. But a wise man named Davey once told me to see games for what they are, instead of what they aren’t, and here’s what it is.\n\tKatie is a game that takes place in a town where people go to run away from something. A painful lost, an ugly fight, and so on so forth. It’s filled with interactive citizens, that will talk to u a little. And when I say a little I mean a couple new phrase every day. I don’t think that’s bad per say, since I didn’t walk in expecting a fallout game, where I can hang talking to Easy Pete and ask about how scavenger life is. They fill in the universe in a nice enough way, and I did learn to appreciate their company, even if for short periods of time each. But the name of the game is Katie, and she’s the one you get to hang out with. She’s this game’s Chloe, if you may. \n\tAs I said before, your character doesn’t have lines. Or a name. So Katie is essentially monologuing. Which I’m typically against in games, I don’t like this Battlefield Story mode like thing where your character, your gateway to that universe, is an empty shell that everyone likes for some mysterious reason. It’s done so the player can put itself on the character’s shoes and increase immersion or something, but it feels like a shortcut for relatability, which serves the same purpose but works better. But here, I actually liked it. This game is… about Katie. Not about you, and you might as well be an imaginary friend, a coping mechanism or just a quiet person. But… this game talks about how important it is to be there for others, and when Katie is the one taking the brunt of relatability (after all, she is the one we relate to) it feels nice to… be there for her and listen. \n\tThis is the main thing, in the end. This game feels nice. It feels intimate, like a rant of its creator that we get to listen to.  It has this comfortable atmosphere, because this town is comfortable. Avoiding yer shit is comfortable. Dealing with it is the messy part. And you see all these people walking around and soaking in the comfortability of it all and… You understand. I’d be walking around there all day too. Because dealing with stuff is… hard. But it’s easier if you have someone there to listen to you, and hold your hand through it. And I don’t know how personal this game is to its creators, and how much they relate to what Katie is going through. But I’m… really glad that they moved on, if they did. And I hope they had someone to listen to them too. I… was glad I was there for Katie, and hoped she was okay once she left. And that made me forget that she didn’t even exist hahaha. At least not her as in *her*. But if you caught yourself so empathic towards a character, it’s a good character. And if a character focused game has a great written character, that’s a great game. That’s what I think anyway. I’m glad it was made, and that I got to play it. \n       So thank you, for sharing. I’m glad I got to stop and listen. Looking forward to more by Lonely Frontier. I hope y’all find what you are looking for.  \n","timestamp_created":1604021524,"timestamp_updated":1604021524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4sLIu/UCdtH7qgI="}
