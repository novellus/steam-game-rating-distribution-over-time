    review: "Well tho...\nI have bought that game because of a 50% discount.\n\nHowever,\
      \ the game has got me some \"BETA\" information on top right of the window.\
      \ Even if the game is not marked as Early Access or any information about its\
      \ beta-state. \n\nIn current state i cannot recommand the game (20.12.2017),\
      \ because of:\n- Key-binding not correct. In Tutorial you will get info for\
      \ pressing tab to get into inventory. -> Nothing happens\n- In first campaign\
      \ mode you get some quests, but no clue what to do exactly or whatsoever.\n\
      - You get some info how to interact with your world, but the world won't interact\
      \ with you. (except to kill you)\n\nConclusion: The game is not ready to be\
      \ bought on the date of this review."
