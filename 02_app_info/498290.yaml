    short_description: "Racket: Nx is a game of skill focusing on your spatial awareness,\
      \ motor control and reflexes. Inspired by Squash, you are given a racket and\
      \ ball\u2026 Unlike Squash, you are thrown into a glass dome in space with dynamic\
      \ patterns of targets on its walls, and pitted against time."
