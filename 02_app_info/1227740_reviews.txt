Is the learning curve hard, yes. But the Dev (1 guy by the way!) has been making constant and frequent improvements. As of this review the tutorial system has been completely revamped so I recommend giving it another go if you gave up in the early stages. I also recommend increasing the starting income and experience you gain when starting a new game. In my opinion its too grindy on the default. Especially if you don't want to spend hours to upgrade your gear and buildings, which is where the game really starts to feel satisfying. \n\nWhat keeps drawing me to the game is the quirky retro but 3D visuals and the Dev has been upgrading that too! I like to check into this game every couple weeks to see whats been added. One of my favorite things is just the silly side of the game. Like if you don't clean up a mess it'll spawn these goo monsters that you have to attack with a spray bottle. The game also states rats and fires will be coming soon too so I can't wait to see how those are. \n\nWhile I've never made my own beer the games makes me want to give it a go. I hope the dev keeps on updating this game because when I think about how Star Dew Valley started and what it became I think this game has the same potential if the dev keeps at it!","timestamp_created":1599256344,"timestamp_updated":1599256344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw3ObGrfQCfITpnwI="}
