    detailed_description: "<h1>The Ultimate Helicopter Warfare Experience taken to\
      \ new heights!</h1><p>Starting from August 20, 2020, Heliborne has officially\
      \ became HELIBORNE: ENHANCED EDITION. Our Steam Card was fully updated. From\
      \ now on there there is only one edition of the game called \u2018Enhanced Edition\u2019\
      . This edition not only contains the base game but also all the DLCs that were\
      \ released until now (over a dozen!) in the price of the regular game. We want\
      \ everybody to experience the game in its entirety.<br><br>IMPORTANT: As we\
      \ promised to our community, all who have bought the game prior to this change,\
      \ get the FREE UPDATE TO ENHANCED EDITION! So, even if you own just the basic\
      \ version of the game with no DLCs installed, you will still get access to both\
      \ the Enhanced Edition of the game and ALL DLCs released until now! Enjoy!<br><br>ABOUT\
      \ HELIBORNE: ENHANCED EDITION<br><br>Enhanced Edition is the next big step for\
      \ the franchise. It will be a brand new visual quality mixed with significant\
      \ gameplay overhaul. Klabater now develops Enhanced Edition and will release\
      \ it on August 20, 2020, fully re-mastered, taking into account the expectations\
      \ of the community!<br><br>With Heliborne: Enhanced Edition the Ultimate Helicopter\
      \ Warfare Experience is now taken to new heights! <br><br>New Prototype Machines\
      \ <br>Fully Upgraded Game Engine <br>New Day &amp; Night Maps <br>Updated in-game\
      \ Physics <br>Empowered Multiplayer Experience <br>Refreshed User Interface<br><br>Enhanced\
      \ Edition is meant as a final version of the Heliborne game dedicated to those\
      \ who love the game already but also for newcomers. But this is definitely not\
      \ our final word when it comes to the Heliborne brand in general. Expect more\
      \ news in the upcoming months!<br><br>IS ENHANCED EDITION WORTH YOUR MONEY?<br><br>If\
      \ you\u2019re new to Heliborne or you had it wishlisted but always wanted to\
      \ wait for a \u201Cdefinitive\u201D edition of the game or a cool discount,\
      \ now is the time to fly. Why? Because you get the basic game and over a dozen\
      \ of cool DLC in one edition and at a very decent price. Here\u2019s a short\
      \ summary of your \u2018savings\u2019 if you decide to buy Enhanced Edition\
      \ (compared to older versions):<br><br>The old version of the game was 19,99\
      \ USD/EUR. The DLCs are altogether worth   54,85 USD/EUR... So, if you\u2019\
      d want to gather the whole package, it would then cost you around 75 USD/EUR.<br>From\
      \ August 20, the 75 USD/EUR value content will be priced at 29,99 USD/EUR...\
      \ As simple as that!<br>Sooo, you get EVERYTHING at once and you SAVE 60%!</p><br><h1>About\

    review: "Jogo muito bom e divertido,bem feito,se voc\xEA realmente gosta de jogos\
      \ de helic\xF3pteros vai gostar de heliborne,\xE9 um semi-simulador bem gostoso\
      \ de jogar,voc\xEA faz miss\xF5es de ataque,resgate,captura etc, muito divertido\
      \ e bem elaborado,focado s\xF3 em helic\xF3pteros quem gosta vai curti muito\
      \ o jogo, recomendo!\n\nOs gr\xE1ficos s\xE3o bem bonitos e a jogabilidade muito\
      \ boa e divertida,o melhor jogo de helic\xF3ptero que j\xE1 joguei,ele tem uma\
      \ jun\xE7\xE3o de coisas que n\xE3o o torna um jogo cansativo,diferente de outros\
      \ que j\xE1 joguei!\n\nTem um grande potencial de melhorar ainda mais,inclusive\
      \ corrigindo os problemas que a comunidade pede! Obs: Tem uma grande variedade\
      \ de Helic\xF3pteros, que n\xE3o achei em nenhum outro jogo! Coloque a vis\xE3\
      o do cockpit igual o interior original de cada helic\xF3ptero,assim traria mais\
      \ realismo para o jogo,mostrando o painel e interior do helic\xF3ptero!\nVery\
      \ good and fun game, well done, if you really like helicopter games you will\
      \ like heliborne, it is a very nice semi-simulator to play, you do attack, rescue,\
      \ capture missions etc, very fun and well elaborated, focused only in helicopters\
      \ who likes will enjoy the game very much, I recommend!\n\nThe graphics are\
      \ very beautiful and the gameplay is very good and fun, the best helicopter\
      \ game I've ever played, it has a combination of things that doesn't make it\
      \ a tiring game, unlike others I've played!\n\nIt has great potential to improve\
      \ even more, including correcting the problems that the community asks for!\
      \ Note: There is a wide variety of Helicopters, which I haven't found in any\
      \ other game! Make the cockpit view the same as the original interior of each\
      \ helicopter, so it would bring more realism to the game, showing the panel\
      \ and interior of the helicopter!"
