    review: 'The software works great and as intended.


      I got the elite version dirt cheap from a steam sale, I don''t think it''s worth
      full price for elite but I''d say it''s worth it on sale.


      Licenses bought on steam DO work with the download copy when you have a license
      supporting multiple installs, this means you can monitor your home network without
      installing steam on all your other pc''s.


      One important thing to note that I didn''t know when I bought it is that it
      does not support rate limiting your network, however it does have per application
      firewall features, you can block any application from connecting at will other
      than certain "hollow shell" microsoft official apps such as "yourphone.exe".


      This program will obviously require admin privileges to install, as it installs
      as a system service in the background. The application that you launch from
      steam is more of a UI for the program, the actual functions run on the service
      meaning you don''t need to worry about starting it from steam every time you
      boot your pc.



      All in all, I''d recommend it to any sysadmin with a network they want to keep
      safe, but for the every day user this is a bit over the top and not worth the
      price. If you are not sure why you''d need this I recommend getting something
      like malwarebytes for your home network instead of this - this does not protect
      your home network, it''s more of a tool to help you protect it yourself.'
