      work or hire someone to work; when they buy a car or milk at a supermarket.
      You are the head of a corporation, and you decide what taxes you will be paid.<br>You
      can also expand your &quot;corporation&quot; to neighboring countries. Joining

      have plenty of tools available to you to manage your domestic policies. You
      need to think ahead and take control of the &quot;employees of the corporation&quot;

      &quot;corporations&quot; are the states. Your employees are all citizens of
      the country. You don't pay them a salary - they will pay you themselves. You
      manage taxes and collect them.
