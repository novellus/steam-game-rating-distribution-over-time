The game doesn't even save your volume settings while in the game, much less if were to close the game and come back later.\n\n2) When your game is over, the game like old arcade games will ask you to put in three initials.  Then if you play another game right after that, the game won't remember your previous initials and ask you to set them again.  Ugh.  Why did the developers choose this three initials route anyway when they tell us the game will save the high scores to the Steam leaderboards?  Wouldn't it be much better for the game to just automatically save our high scores with our Steam name?\n\n3) Enemies and even high bosses just immediately vanish when killed leaving the game feeling extremely unsatisfying.  A Boss would have tons of explosions at the very least but instead just vanishes.  Blip!  Gone magically.  This doesn't only look lazy and bad, but it make the game not fun at all to play\n\nI could go on and on.. but honestly it doesn't really matter.  I highly doubt the developers care enough to update or fix anything here and I base that on the fact they can't even be bothered to make sure volume sliders don't even stay where you set them for ten seconds while in the game.\n\nWhile the developers brag about there being over 1,000 waves of enemies to survive, that's all really meaningless when the first wave feels this gaudy, this lazy, and this cheap.  It's just not fun.  Why would we want to play more than one level much less pay any amount of money for this low effort game?\n\nRefunded.  Not Recommended.  You can find at least a thousand space shooters for free on itch and gamejolt for free that show more effort and care by the developers and that are much more fun to play than this.\n\n2 out of 10.  - And trust me when I say that is over-rating this game and giving it the benefit of the doubt.","timestamp_created":1586021569,"timestamp_updated":1586021683,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526981830596923828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ488mQo/ECc+CL/gE="}
