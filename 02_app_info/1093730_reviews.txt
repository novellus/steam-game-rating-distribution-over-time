A huge standalone adventure within the Supraland universe, adding a GIANT chunk of brilliant, clever content and LOL moments to one of my favourite games ever. \n\nI just finished it and I loved it! All I can say is don't get hung up on the \"not as good as main game\" talk! This DLC is still exceptional entertainment in its own right (and stupidly good value right now).\n\nPut it this way: Even without the Supraland main game, this Crash DLC alone is one of the most entertaining, intelligent, engaging and FUNNY games I've played in the past 10 years. I can't really say more than that.\n\nBuy this DLC with the main game and support this genius developer to produce the next Supraland games. I can't get enough of this amazing world.","timestamp_created":1609744607,"timestamp_updated":1609744607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48ayQ5vYCcc2owAI="}
