You can find all the music and ambient tracks as wavesound files in the installation folder.\n\nThe controls are awkward to get used to but not impossible. You move with the mouse by clicking on directional prompts that appear on the screen.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward and monotonous most of the time.\nYou are a cat and walk around an area with the girl in tow, sometimes having to protect her. \nTo reach the end of a stage you'll need to climb up and down and find certain key items to progress. You can also collect memory fragments, which tell you the story of the game. \nThe English is not the best but you can understand it.\nOnce you reach a specific area you'll enter flight mode to travel to the next part. This is easily the most frustrating, especially later on when it turns into more of a trial and error section that, at times, needs very accurate movement.\n\nRinse and repeat and you got yourself 4-5 hours of constant climbing, cat meowing, bumping into the girl to make her slow butt follow you and terrible flight sections.\nBut at the end of it all you save humanity and get to watch credits that feel a good 15 minutes too long. \nBecause thats how long they are.\n\nIf you truly want to put yourself through this I recommend saving quite a bit. It might just save you time in case you encounter certain events, failure or a rare crash. \nThe only time it crashed for me was when I mashed buttons in frustration, so dont do that.","timestamp_created":1559149365,"timestamp_updated":1559150079,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521345734596252441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wcWlgusCd42lwgE="}
