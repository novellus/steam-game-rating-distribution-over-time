In my opinion, this is the best example of early access game you can find. \nRight now it's completely playable, so far I've not found any critical bugs or imperfections which can ruin your gameplay experience. Good job, developers!\n\nNow about the game itself. This is kinda puzzle game, where the main goal is to to reach point B from point A. Many of levels i have seen so far have different ways to be completed. Also, most levels have pretty unique ideas and mechanic interactions. The difficulty increases pretty gradually, depending on how many levels you have accomplished.\n\nSo this is logical puzzle, (obviously) inspired by Portal and dungeon clawlers, with a number of achievements and challenges, which will definitely blow your mind. If you like hardcore games (i don't) or ones like solitaire, you are very welcome!","timestamp_created":1585259818,"timestamp_updated":1585259818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637714803218841553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwaW2jPECf9Wr+wE="}
