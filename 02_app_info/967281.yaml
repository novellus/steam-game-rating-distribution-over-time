      \ featuring the railroad\u2019s unique \u201CCrescent Cab,\u201D is now available\
      \ for Train Simulator.<br><br>Beginning in 2010, the Norfolk Southern began\
      \ a program at its famed Juniata (Altoona), Pennsylvania shops to upgrade its\
      \ fleet of standard SD60 diesel locomotives which dated to the mid-1980s. Along\
      \ with numerous upgrades to control, braking, and safety systems, the rebuilding\
      \ process was keynoted by application of a modernized \u201CCrescent Cab\u201D\
      \ as designed by Norfolk Southern. Powered by a 16-cylinder 710G3B engine and\
      \ equipped with EM2000 microprocessors, the 4,000-horsepower SD60E can be found\
      \ across the Norfolk Southern system totting everything from intermodals to\
      \ heavy coal trains.<br><br>Through 2017, more than 130 SD60E locomotives rolled\
      \ out of Norfolk Southern\u2019s Juniata shops, including not only locomotives\

      \ ex-Union Pacific and ex-Chicago &amp; North Western locomotives). <br><br>Created\

      \ with realistic control and operating features.<br><br>As a bonus, the SD60E\

    review: 'By now NS will have its complete fleet of SD60''s rebuilt to this, the
      SD60E. It features a new safety cabin, better sound isolation and new electronics.
      The result is a powerful, modern locomotive which offers easy handling and a
      smooth ride. The engine sounds very civilized, providing a relaxed, comfortable
      in cab atmosphere, which is only disturbed by applying the harsh sounding horn
      (but there are 3 different horns available, depending on which loc number you
      drive). This also triggers the bell and the ditchlights, which can be reset
      pressing ''B'' (2x) and Ctrl + L.


      In other words: I like it!!
