This is a great entry-level experience for new VR HTC VIVE users. After running down the usual intro pieces like The Lab and Trials on Tatooine, you'll want to show someone who may have gotten a little overwhelmed this one. It's relatable and simple. In its own right, it is excellent. One of my favourite experiences on the VIVE yet. No frills, just fun. pretty fun, but it could use some polishing. The graphics and effects are meh\ndoes exactly what you expect it to - and does it well.\nExcellent work! \n6/10 and worth $2-3 BUT it's currently FREE!!!","timestamp_created":1486408395,"timestamp_updated":1486408395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j4W2itoCcYy9cQ=="}
