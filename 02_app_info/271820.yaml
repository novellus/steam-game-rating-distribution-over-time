    review: "I have finally beaten the game at the time of writing! :D , yay!\n\n\
      If you like card-game type + strategy, this game is for you!\n\nBoy, some strats\
      \ are required to beat some of the tougher players; \nThe last boss is not easy\
      \ to beat; lots of luck is required, i use a mostly offensive strats\n\nWould\
      \ i recommend this game? : Definitely!"
