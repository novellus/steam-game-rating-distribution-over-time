    review: "It's just like, I thought we were done with these types of games in 2015?\n\
      \nAbandonment should just be abandonware instead. This game doesn't work correctly,\
      \ I broke it within seconds of being in the first room. I couldn't progress\
      \ more than five minutes into the game because everything just stopped working.\n\
      \nThe only scary part of the game is the volume at which screams randomly happen\
      \ as stuff appears on the screen. It honestly sounds like a lawnmower in your\
      \ ears.\n\nLet's just not anymore aigh fam jam?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoFM5BDmZc0\
      \ \n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, check out the curator page.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/29029552"
