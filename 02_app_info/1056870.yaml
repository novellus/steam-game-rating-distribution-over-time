    legal_notice: Although the Sphaeres VR Experiences are intended to be calming
      and relaxing, some people may experience discomfort due to the nature of immersive
      Virtual Reality and 360 degree videos. Should you experience any discomfort
      we recommend taking off your VR headset immediately and to sit or lie down until
      your discomfort has passed. We take no responsibility for any injuries, accidents
      or discomforts caused during or after watching our 360 degree VR video experiences.
      You watch 360 VR video experiences entirely at your own risk and we recommend
      that you closely familiarise yourself with the risk of using VR headsets before
      use and that you closely read and follow the manufacturer's guidelines of your
      particular VR headset.

    review: Played this once and it was immersive in VR.  True 60 degree high resolution.  Then
      on every subsequent run of this and every other title from this developer they
      just played one a 2d 'screen' in VR.
