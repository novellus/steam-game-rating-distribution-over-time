    review: "So this was an interesting, didn't expect to see it here of all places\
      \ and hopefully you'll find this review helpful:\n1) This is a PS1 game: \n\
      I'm not saying this is a port of a PS1 game, this is literally a rip of the\
      \ disc being run through a PS1 emulator, specifically PCSX-Reloaded, you'd think\
      \ this would be a negative and it kind of is, but it's actually very convenient,\
      \ the build of PCSX-R they use doesn't have a lot of features and I found it\
      \ fairly lacking, but hey, you can easily use any other emulator if you want,\
      \ the game files are right there in the folder! I used Duckstation, which is\
      \ why it looks like I haven't played the game for more than a few minutes on\
      \ steam, it allowed me to upscale the game, run it smoothly and I even used\
      \ a widescreen hack because why not, it's super simple to do and I highly recommend\
      \ it because that's the fun of PC gaming. That said, I do wish the product page\
      \ was upfront about it, much of GOG's runs on Dosbox, emulation is legit, no\
      \ need to hide it.\n\n2) So what about the game itself? \nIt's a somewhat neat\
      \ take on the Star Fox formula, a rail shooter with occasional branching paths\
      \ with a rather neat weapon system. You have a primary and secondary fire, but\
      \ unlike other games, your secondary fire doesn't use a second button, instead\
      \ it fires along slower intervals between your primary fire, which sounds weird,\
      \ but it actually works, you can pick up items that permanently upgrade your\
      \ primary or secondary fire, the more you pick up, the more deadly you become,\
      \ infact the penalty for dying is to lose just one level of your primary/secondary\
      \ fire which is good motivation to not die since you make the game a little\
      \ bit harder each time you die. \nYou also can pick up shield power ups which\
      \ make you briefly invincible and are immensely helpful against bosses as well\
      \ as bombs which clear the screen. \nThe controls are otherwise very simple,\
      \ you won't be doing any barrel rolls or flips, just maneuvering the chopper.\
      \ The camera sticks a lot more closely to the ship and you have a much wider\
      \ berth than you typically do in Star fox, so the camera can occasionally be\
      \ an issue (only really while attempting to dodge and fire at the same time,\
      \ which can be a slight problem in boss fights).\nBecause the fire rate is dependent\
      \ on how many times you push the fire button, for the love of all that is holy;\
      \ USE A CONTROLLER WITH A TURBO FUNCTION OR THE KEYBOARD EQUIVALENT! \nThe game\
      \ is also dark, REALLY dark, as in; \"Why is most of the screen black\" dark\
      \ so if you're emulator of choice is able, bump up the gamma slightly, otherwise\
      \ I rather like the atmosphere of the game, just like Star Fox 64, everything\
      \ is so low poly you are often trying to interpret what it is you are shooting\
      \ at. I love it.\nThe story is very arcade-y as in it's barely existent, Earth\
      \ is being invaded by aliens, go kill em, that's it, it made me really appreciate\
      \ how much life Star Fox's characters added to their games as this game could've\
      \ used some banter.\n\nSo, is the game worth it? Maybe? I'm enjoying it, but\
      \ i'm someone who loves this style of rail shooter (which was sadly never a\
      \ popular genre outside of Star Fox), this is a halfway decent one, as well\
      \ as a stupidly obscure and rare PS1 game. I found the best way to play this\
      \ is in short bursts. Also the music is awesome!\n\nPS Hey! Throwback Entertainment,\
      \ you guys have a great number of awesome IPs in your vault, i'd be happy to\
      \ even buy your roms if you straight up sold them, maybe invest some of the\
      \ cash you make from em back into emulation development, add more legitimacy\
      \ to the emulation scene! It would be awesome! Extreme G and Vexx are games\
      \ that deserve more of a spotlight!"
