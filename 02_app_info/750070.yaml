    review: Anyone who tries this game all I can say is it's boring and slow, and
      very unexciting. I went into it thinking the game would be better. I kept it
      hoping that there might be some improvements to make this game actually worth
      playing and that just proved to be my biggest mistake in the world. I regret
      buying it and wish I return what I'm stuck with but can't. For anyone looking
      at it, I would recommend seeing if there's a demo available first so you can
      try it out before spending your money on it, that's a much better idea.
