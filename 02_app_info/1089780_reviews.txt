And now is the day I finaly get it!!!! This game should be the standard in Single Player Tactical VR FPS in the future. It still rough but it has BIG potential.\n\nPros :\n- Finally you get a VR FPS Tactical single player game which allow you to play alone - No friend or internet required!\n- Has many challenging levels (maps)\n- It has ACTION CAM! This should be standard in VR and could give more prespective for streamers when streaming / recording their VR gameplay!!!\n\nCons :\n- Limited weapon and attachments (well it still early access)\n- The presentation, user interface, menus, etc is not good and confusing. First time I arrived in the hanggar, I don't have any clue of what to do. It would be better if they could do like Contractors VR where you can call the menu just by clicking.\n- Level presentation is not good. You should pay a level designer to make better presentation of the map. For now, every object on the map is just like copy paste\n- No gun stock calibration (please add this!!!!)\n\nI wish this game could develop better and better","timestamp_created":1610017808,"timestamp_updated":1610131642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6eLU8fYCc8efwQI="}
