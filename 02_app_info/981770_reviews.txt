I've said this before, but these girls are awesome and I love this series. This \"novel/dating\" game, however, is...well... Let's explore the ups and downs of the game (+, +/-, -, ?):\n\n+Everything looks good, as usual.\n+You can massage and charm Ryōna. Trillion stars.\n+Streaming this was fun. Buuut I gotta say, I was scared to death when [spoiler] THE OBVIOUS SEX TOY [/spoiler] appeared. I was expecting something that would have been more than okay with me but not okay with any streaming service.\n+It feels good when a character gives you compliments. The world can be a horrible place, but these girls will always be nice to you...*\n+/- Massaging, experiencing short story bursts and listening to monologues. That's pretty much all there is.\n+/- Definitely for those who need encouragement in personal life.\n-*...Even when you just keep on grabbing their diddies. I don't like that it's required when you're completing the game, but then again...\n-There's almost any content. I feel like after completing 2 girls (sounds wrong) I don't need to come back. Ever. There are more characters to complete, but I don't feel like doing the same thing over and over again.\n-Hmmm....music?\n-Oh look! Some gameplay! Oh look! A skip button that gives you the same result as playing the game! Sooo, skip.\n-Couldn't I get a short animated cut scene with a girl after I've done my damndest to help her...\n-Asuka's [spoiler] LITTLE SISTER [/spoiler] sections are not okay with me. Even if it's cosplay, just no.\n?No full boobage. I'm torn about this, because I don't really, really need it in this series, but I've seen it in the anime already! And you can see it too! It's all on YouTube!\n?Pleasing women to the max in real life like in this game's \"gameplay sections\" in just a minute is a dream shared by many men. But, I'm pretty sure this game does not teach you how to do it. You can try thou ;)\n\nI can barely recommend this game. If you're not a fan of Senran Kagura beforehand, skip this. There's an audience for these types of games, but unfortunately, this was not for me. But, you know Ryōna, you can talk to me anytime. 5/10.","timestamp_created":1609965960,"timestamp_updated":1610141004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjr748fYCdsaNwQI="}
