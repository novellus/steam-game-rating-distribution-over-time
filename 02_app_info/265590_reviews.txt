It is also similar to modern titles like Xcom. It is not turn based, but it keeps to the small team with a variety of classes, equipment, and skills. Skills are unique to the classes, and are powered up individually. That's everything I felt this game does well. If you are interested in this title, I would say wait for it to go on sale for 75% off.\n\nA few points that really made this a foul game to me:\nExploration of the maps takes hours of gameplay in the single player campaign.\nDuring exploration you are constantly swarmed by enemies; there are no waves, just a steady and annoying flow.\nThe sprint hardly increases your move speed (enemies will still catch you), and has a long cooldown.\nAll of this makes me want to skip exploring, but almost all of the equipment and skills are discovered by exploring.\nUnit statistics, like evade and AR res (armor resist), are not explained, but critical to gameplay.\nIt works, but has a few serious bugs (like enemies shooting at you through walls and hitting).","timestamp_created":1466697588,"timestamp_updated":1608934901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569559574127197266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Mj/zfYCfcLCWg=="}
