A multiple-route escape room mystery with multiple endings that takes the idea of interactive gameplay to another level. All puzzles are well thought out and really fun - they rarely get confusing to the point where you're lost, and even if that were to happen the dialogue of the characters helps you get the idea of what you're supposed to do next. The story itself doesn't seem that much at first but wait until you get to the true end; I genuinely missed having this many successive plot twists in a story, and they execute all of them quite well, with some notes of ambiguity here and there perhaps. The characters are great, each serving their purpose for the story - the way they bounce off one another is amusing and I adored the humor; all those small jokes sprinkled here and there with perfect comedic timing made for a really great time. I liked most of the voice acting, quite a lot - the VAs really did a good job conveying the right emotions with good timing and expressiveness. [b]Spike Chunsoft [/b] is known for their quality titles, and Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9-Jikan 9-Nin 9 no Tobira is no exception, they don't miss and I wholeheartedly recommend this title if you are familiar with any of their other games or not.","timestamp_created":1609803750,"timestamp_updated":1609803750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp/vx5/YCf+fFwAI="}
