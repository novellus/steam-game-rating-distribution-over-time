There seems to be some mixed reviews on this game so I'm going to do my best to lay everything out for everyone before they make a decision. Let me start by saying, I love this game. That being said, nothing is without faults and Skully is no exception to that. \n\nThis game has a lot of charm and is unique enough to set it apart from other games in this category. The characters were well written, and they had a lot of really good chemistry. Everything they said to one another felt natural. The story was nothing too new, siblings fighting + gods fighting gives you Skully. The puzzles weren't overly difficult, but every now and then I would stumble across one that had me looking around for a few minutes until something stood out to me, but that was rare. \n\nI have seen people say that there is an issue with poor programming but honestly, I didn't see that. Sometimes when climbing i would hit a bump that would knock me off that platform and i would have to start it over, but to me things like that only add to the challenge. I did come across one or two puzzles that if i was standing a certain way on a moving platform it would get stuck and i would have to move slightly to remedy the situation, but if that's the worst thing i have to deal with in a game, then I wouldn't give it enough thought to complain about it. \n\nMy only real complaint would be on start up sometimes there would be quite a bit of lag that caused the camera to go crazy for a while until the game caught up to itself, but this isn't the only game I've seen with an issue like that so ill give it a pass. \n\nTL;DR \nDon't listen to the negative reviews. This game is a great, relaxing, casual game (although everything has its faults). I'd guess that the people leaving negative reviews aren't that good at this style of game in the first place and don't want to just admit that they are bad.","timestamp_created":1609290133,"timestamp_updated":1609290133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44NXK2PYCeIPQvgI="}
