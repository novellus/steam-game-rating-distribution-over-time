To play Asynchronous Multiplayer we recommend betting some real life money, and taking turns on the same computer.<br \/>\r\nThere are 2 ways to play, you can add up rankings and see who has the best ranking after 3 rounds, or can add up total score after 3 rounds (3 rounds for each player.)

The framerate is not limited to 60, you can increase the framerate to a very high amount, the maximum fps is as much as your monitor fps.","about_the_game":"Aim: Warmup is a game to assist your aim in games like Valorant, CS: GO, Quake, and Overwatch. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis software has been tested, immediately after using the software a user was able to clutch pistol round in Valorant with absurd accuracy and headshots.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you still suck at the game after using the software, then try practicing with the software more, or you can play Asynchronous Multiplayer with your friend or family.
