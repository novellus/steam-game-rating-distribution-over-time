Since the release of yoyo compiler, the  built in standard compiler seems to have been intentionally slowed down to encourage the purchase of yyc. aside from the fact you dont have full access to processor power with standard compiler it is also buggy and compiled games dont install correctly without very specific windows settings. All export modules are valued at $300 each or $700 as a pack though you dont get to try this funcionality, even over a trial period, so i am dubious to say the least about investing in these modules. Lastly, i was working on a rather large game and had neatly bundled all of the games assets into folders and sub folders. after an update i logged back into gamemaker only to find all the links and assets had dissappeared. i looked in the asset directory, all was apparently well. i opened a backup of the same game only to find the same problem. i dragged and dropped my assets folder back onto gamemaker so all the assets were once again recognised by gamemaker, but all directories and sub directories, as well as all functions for all assets, were gone. so after months of lost work i bit the bullet and started again, relinking all assets and functions to the way the previously were. i also kept a backup of gamemakers backup, just in case. same problem occured a few months down the track, gamemaker backup corrupted AND my backup backup seemed to revert to gamemakers backup as soon as i loaded it. in summing up, i wouldnt recommend this program, not given the amount of time i spent to achieve nothing, big plans of a quality release on simultaneous platforms a myth. i havent bought any other software that is similar so i cant point you in a better direction, just dont come this way.\n\nSo i know im replying 5 years down the track, but yes UE (if youre a visual scripter has blueprints) and unity ( has playmaker) are both MUCH better options, there isnt an OS that you can't publish to (though ps, xbox and switch will all need dev licences before compilation). I've been using unity since my last post, their licensing is super reasonable and the unity store is FULL of low cost assets, created by people who truly just want their creations to appear in game.\nP.s as we programmers are used to typing_like_this grammar is only an issue when submitting an essay, i'm 15 years out of school, you don't like how i type? learn to code. you'll \nget it.\n\nIF I TYPE LIKE THIS DOES IT HURT YOUR EARS?!?!!?! Cos youre the only one thats gonna hear it. My comments dont count anymore cos they changed the steam name of gamemaker.......For 129USD base price.
