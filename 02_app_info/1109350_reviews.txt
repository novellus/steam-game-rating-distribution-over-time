Sadly there is limited gameplay, and battle mechanics are not great. You can easily beat bots without a real strategy. \n\nA few things to mention about the game is that you start off controlling the capital city surrounded by different tribes, settlements, and villages. Your goal is to unite these places under your state to win.  As mentioned before, there is a lot of beautiful detail for a game in this price range. A significant part of this game is building structures in which you can hire employees and earn revenue to build more buildings to attract skilled workers so you can buy more buildings or invest in settlements to gain favor. \n\nYour citizens will protect your settlements that are under your protection from bandits. You don't necessarily have to protect every tribe or village, but it's a good idea if you don't want to lose any reputation points.\n\nAre you interested yet? If not, that is understandable. Alpha games don't get much love, and usually, I wouldn't spend money on getting one. Still, this game shows a lot of promise, and the sole developer in this project has shown a lot of compassion and dedication that I feel confident supporting the game because I know it will be worth it. \n\nIf you're not interested in buying the game in its current state, then I would recommend keeping up with it. So far, I'm enjoying it and am supporting the project.\n\n**Things I wish to see in this game would include better battle mechanics, in which case weapons can do a lot more damage, so it would be a better idea to invest in dodging or taking cover instead of ganging up on a bandit one at a time. \n\nWhen I think of the wild west, I think of wagon convoys that can trade goods and have to need protection from bandits and hostile tribes.","timestamp_created":1585712892,"timestamp_updated":1585712892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhtH2mfECe+b5/AE="}
