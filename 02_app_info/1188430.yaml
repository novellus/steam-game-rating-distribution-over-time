    review: 'It''s a fun little game.  It''s not going to have as much deck-building
      depth/synergy as some other games like STS.  However, it has a fun atmosphere
      and overall concept.  Well-done for a 2 dev team.  I wasn''t a huge fan of the
      danger level mechanic in general, but there is an easy mode that does make the
      game more manageable for those that are struggling.  Recommended to grab on
      sale if you like this kind of game.
