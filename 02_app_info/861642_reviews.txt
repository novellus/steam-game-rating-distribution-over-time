The animations are pretty good. The environment looks good. Ride runs smoothly. I really loved the dragon / wyvern. Probably the best looking asset in this series. It's also animated pretty well, which is surprising because most animations in this series is lacking.\n\nThe ride is pretty long as well. I think it's around 5-6 minutes long. It has speed, jumps, twists, turns, all of it. It has nice background vistas as well. And you're doing all this with lots of battles going on all around you.\n\nRate 7/10.\n","timestamp_created":1537943646,"timestamp_updated":1537943646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw87WliuYCc/24qwE="}
