    about_the_game: <strong>Xibalba</strong> is a first person shooter game, a tribute
      to the greatest classics of the 90's like Doom, Wolfensetin, and Duke Nukem.
      In this game you will take the role of Acoatl, a young indigenous man who follows
      the trail of thieves in the jungle, arriving at some ancient Mayan ruins that
      he had never seen. Delve into them and prepare to face the ancient horrors that
      the Mayans and other cultures left behind.<br><br>Throughout three chapters
      you will experience great challenges that will test your mettle, as well as
      the satisfaction of victory.<br>Your enemies are varied, lethal, and implacable,
      and you should be more so. With your weapons from a simple revolver, to sawed-off
      shotguns, magic rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and the help of your courage,
      you will be able to dominate the creatures that filled Ibero-American nightmares
      and myths for centuries. From small chaneques, through mythological vampires,
      the legendary Nahuales, to creatures that the mere mention of their name caused
      terror.<br><br>You will walk the long and narrow corridors of ancient temples,
      infested with enemies who only yearn to take your life, and it is in you not
      to make them easy. The further you go, the closer you get to the underworld.<br><i>Xibalba
      welcomes you.</i>

    review: I like it, reminds me a lot to Serious Sam but that's a good thing, have
      an interesting looking using 2D and 3D with the enemies and the levels , I enjoyed
      very much and for sure the game can improve with the time.
