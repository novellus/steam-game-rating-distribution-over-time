      \ game with a lot of focus on speedrunning. The levels offer a series of different\
      \ challenges designed to encourage players to do multiple runs in order to improve\

      \ Auxiliary capacitors for instance are power-up type boosts that can be collected\
      \ while playing. These capacitors may then be discharged to provide additional\
      \ movement speed or to blast away enemies whilst damaging them and providing\
      \ additional shield energy. A Global leader board exists so that players can\
      \ compare their scores against one other. There is a set of enemies that are\
      \ commonly encountered in all levels, each level however features one or more\
      \ unique boss. Kronostasis's story is inspired by Greek mythology but set in\
      \ a futuristic timeline. The enemies you fight are inspired by mythical creatures\
      \ and all zodiacs are represented by the bosses you encounter.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
