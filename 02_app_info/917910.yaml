    about_the_game: Lucid Path is an experiment, an attempt to create a game which
      is one of its kind. At its core, it is a story rich RPG dungeon crawler with
      semi automatic turn based battles. The time you can spend in the dungeon is
      determined by your health points and when it goes to 0, you must leave the dungeon
      and regenerate it. It can be done by working or doing quests which can be progressed
      by... playing fast paced mini games.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Turn-based
