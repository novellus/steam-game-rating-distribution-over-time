    review: So, this story is an odd one. It takes some moves in directions I like.
      The maps and other visuals that can be optionally added in were a really nice
      touch. The story starts off giving you so much information and it seems like
      you're going to be in for a long haul with tons of interesting twists.... and
      you are... until the end. From the point you reach your first possible "ending",
      the game just rushes towards a finish line in a way that is very boring. It's
      like the creator of this game put their heart and soul into writing the first
      1/4 of a massive story they planned... and then all of a sudden realized that
      it was due for release the next day and just cobbled together a quick wrap-up
      at the very last second for the other 3/4 of the story. I recommend this one
      as its interesting and a concept I would LOVE to see thought out more in a follow-up,
      but I still can't give this higher than a 6/10.
