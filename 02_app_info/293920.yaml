    review: "When I was buying the game, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia. I remember\
      \ my childhood and buying demos so I could see the game to its end. However,\
      \ my childhood had a better picture of this game than I do as an adult. I don't\
      \ like it. It just doesn't do it for me. \nI wasn't able to refund it. I'm stuck\
      \ with it. \nWhat I didn't like:\nInterface\nGameplay\nGraphics\nThe Stat-Raising\n\
      \nWhat I liked:\nThe realisation of having finally bought a game I coveted as\
      \ a kid"
