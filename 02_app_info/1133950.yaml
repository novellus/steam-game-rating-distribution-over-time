    review: A strictly puzzle-focused game. To be fair, I was put off by the dialogues
      between the characters, they are so basic, there is no story, character development,
      just a series of mind puzzles, which have average to high difficulty. So, if
      you want a brain teaser, this game might hit the spot. Not for adventure gamers
      who also care about the story.
