    review: "[h1]Review verfasst am 4.01.2021[/h1]\n\nIch h\xE4tte gern das Programm/Spiel\
      \ ausprobiert, aber es funktioniert leider nicht. Ich kann das Game starten\
      \ und dann f\xE4ngt es an zu laden. Und es l\xE4d und l\xE4d und l\xE4d. Und\
      \ eine Stunde sp\xE4ter ist es immer noch am Laden. Ich habs auch mehrfach gestartet,\
      \ aber es funktioniert leider nicht. Wenn das Spiel halten w\xFCrde, was es\
      \ verspricht, h\xE4tte ich es 100 Pro positiv bewertet! Aber so bleibt mir nichts\
      \ anderes \xFCbrig als es nicht zu empfehlen. Bitte Patcht das Game nach, damit\
      \ es wieder funktioniert! Bitte, bitte, bitte!\n\n\nCool, jetzt scheint es zu\
      \ gehen! Ich werde das Programm diese Woche testen und diese Review nochmal\
      \ aktualisieren. Gebe den Daumen schon mal Hoch! :)"
