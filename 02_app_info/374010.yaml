    review: "No. Just no. I have hard times calling this a game, but whatever. Flaws\
      \ in it are multifold, lets just go down a list.\nFirst, there is no handling\
      \ of physical evidence. Everything is done by dialogues.\nSecond, there is no\
      \ hint of action. Be it chase, escape from locked room or trap, fight with perpetrator...\
      \ These are part of Holmes universe! Yes, I know, the whole budget was consumed\
      \ by shooting FMV sequences with live actors, I have no problem with that. But\
      \ that leads to most catastrophic flaw: The goal of this game, inasmuch there\
      \ is one, is to solve the crime with least possible amount of actual investigating!\
      \ If you go around and interrogate people in your directory, you are presented\
      \ with extremely condescending end, calling you \"armchair detective\". Which\
      \ is EXACT OPPOSITE of what it should mean!\nA.C.Doyle created Sherlock Holmes\
      \ as tireless investigator, going around days and weeks, investigating, interrogatin\
      \ and staking out suspects and witnesses, and closing cases with severe sleep\
      \ deficiency and physical exhaustion. Here, the \"correct\" end is closing case\
      \ without any work done!  Speedrun of this game would take literary seconds!\
      \ I believe the game can be finished with maybe dozen mouseclicks (did not try).\
      \ \nI am sucker for all things Sherlock and this has NOTHING to do with this\
      \ character. I am going back to games from Frogware."
