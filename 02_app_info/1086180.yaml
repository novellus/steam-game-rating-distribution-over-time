    review: "I was introduced to this game by the nice curator [u]Anthro/Furry Tag[/u].\
      \ Originally checking out the game, I was drawn into the simple appeal of a\
      \ furry visual novel that isn't softcore porn, and I am glad to say that there\
      \ is very little pornographic material here. However, [url=https://chirmaya.itch.io/vestige-of-the-past]when\
      \ I looked at the itch.io page online, the last update for the game was nearly\
      \ a year ago[/url]. So it seems that the developer just wants to make a buck,\
      \ or see how popular this game is. This, of course, means that there is potential\
      \ that this game will never get the sequel it baits so heavily at.\n\nThe Good:\n\
      - The art is great. The main characters have multiple facial expressions, and\
      \ the protagonist has multiple postures, and none of it looks bad. Environments\
      \ are also nice as well. There is a lot of potential here, and I would like\
      \ to see what happens next.\n      - Minor side note: Some parts of the later\
      \ end of the game lack completed visuals. Just something to note. This might\
      \ have been a version error, but understand that it seems that this demo isn't\
      \ finished.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The story is weak. The protagonist is motivated initially\
      \ by a desire to escape that is bluntly but weakly expressed in the story. After\
      \ that, the character's motivation disappears, until it is injected back into\
      \ the story towards the end. This left me feeling underwhelmed, as the weak\
      \ build up tapered off into an equally tepid conflict that ended in an unsatisfying\
      \ conclusion. This might be a side affect of...\n- ... The story's short length.\
      \ I think that I am a little bit of a speed reader, but even then, it should\
      \ only take you between two to three hours to complete the game. While brevity\
      \ is not inherently bad, it does leave the reader wanting more.\n- The writing\
      \ is weak. The narrator fails to convince the characters all blend together,\
      \ as each one lacks a distinct voice that would separate them from generic NPCs.\
      \ No one character stands out in the writing, and the characters only express\
      \ themselves within the narrow parameters designated by the author.\n- The lack\
      \ of choices. Spoiler Alert! None of your choices matter. The choices do not\
      \ influence the story, and any available options only deliver a bit of exposition\
      \ before dropping you back to choose again, minus one choice. The lifeblood\
      \ of a good visual novel is the ability to project yourself through the character,\
      \ and a lack of significant choices harms immersion.\n\n* A minor note: While\
      \ the game certainly struggles to deliver a convincing story, it isn't because\
      \ there isn't a desire to deliver one. The story emphasizes the power of magic,\
      \ and the mechanics by which it operates. While certainly interesting on it's\
      \ own, it becomes a dead end when the narrator fails to establish the rules\
      \ as to how it operates. As the reader, it is hard to care about the power of\
      \ magic when it seems to be more of a plot convenience than a mechanic. Investment\
      \ is further damaged by the banality of the story's Groups of Interest, as the\
      \ few characters that the protagonist interacts with aren't fleshed out enough\
      \ to draw sympathy towards any side. Even then, you aren't allowed to choose\
      \ what side you want to ally with, and [b][i]that[/i][/b] hurts the most, as\
      \ a game with illusory choices spits in your face by not allowing you to decide\
      \ your allegiances.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- To be frank, little to nothing about this\
      \ game falls into this category. The graphics are great, the UI is pre-built,\
      \ and the story is serviceable. With so little gameplay, there is little game\
      \ to mess up.\n\nOverall, it is a game that has a brain, but lacks an emotional\
      \ core due to its brevity. This probably won't be a problem in a full-length\
      \ game, but as it is now it is quite disappointing. Don't play this game with\
      \ the expectation of a full game, and understand that your five dollars will\
      \ be paying for something more akin to a demo.\n\nTL;DR: This is not a finished\
      \ game, but more like a demo. While it is certainly earnest, it is unrefined,\
      \ and leaves the reader wanting."
