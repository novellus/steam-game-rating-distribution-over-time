The esc menu had one, but using any option there would just flash a box briefly, and the checkpoints just let you continue from them, they don't save the game.\n\n- The hitbox for the rock you get to throw to remove obstracles, in most cases it completely ignores the collision\n\nThat is the main problems I have with the game.. the rest of my list will be sent to the creator.\n\nMy total playtime was 1.3 hours, because I stopped to write down all the flaws I came over, if you just play the game then it might be shorter then that ..\n\nWill rewrite this when the game have been polished a bit more,","timestamp_created":1592525742,"timestamp_updated":1592535371,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617840766906738281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z6mg5fICcOftjgI="}
