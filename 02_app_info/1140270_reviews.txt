It's somehow even better than Monster Prom. I love the music, the credits are spectacular, the art is incredible, and the writing is as always, dumb as shit and totally fun. Highly recommend to everyone and anyone. \n\nP.S. Juan the Small Magical Latino Cat being in this game and being as cute as he is is fucking awesome.","timestamp_created":1609855235,"timestamp_updated":1609855235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u6626fYCeLrawAI="}
