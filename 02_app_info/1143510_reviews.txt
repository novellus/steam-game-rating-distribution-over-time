I really enjoyed the OST of the game when I played it the first time. I like when developers give access to the music. For this game, you have to pay but I do not mind because it can help the studio to grow up and maybe, someday, a new big game will be released!","timestamp_created":1608569142,"timestamp_updated":1608569142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr6eMw/YCcpT9uwI="}
