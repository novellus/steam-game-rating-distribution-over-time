    review: '[I. Overture]

      [Instrumental]


      [II. About to Crash]

      [Lyrics: John Petrucci]


      [Verse]

      She can''t stop pacing

      She never felt so alive

      Her thoughts are racing

      Set on overdrive

      It takes a village

      This she knows is true

      They''re expecting her

      And she''s got work to do

      He helplessly stands by

      It''s meaningless to try

      As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes

      He says "I''ve never seen her get this bad

      Even though she seems so high"

      He knows that she can''t fly

      And when she falls out of the sky

      He''ll be standing by

      She was raised in a small midwestern town

      By a charming and eccentric loving father

      She was praised as the perfect teenage girl

      And everyone thought highly of her

      And she tried everyday

      With endless drive

      To make the grade

      Then one day

      She woke up to find

      The perfect girl

      Had lost her mind

      Once barely taking a break

      Now she sleeps the days away

      She helplessly stands by

      It''s meaningless to try

      All she wants to do is cry

      No one ever knew she was so sad

      Cause even though she gets so high

      And thinks that she can fly

      She will fall out of the sky

      But in the face of misery

      She found hopefulness

      Feeling better

      She had weathered

      This depression

      Much to her advantage

      She resumed her frantic pace

      Boundless power

      Midnight hour

      She enjoyed the race


      [III. War Inside my Head]

      [Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]


      [Verse 1]

      Napalm showers

      Showed the cowards

      We weren''t there to mess around

      Through heat exhaustion

      And mind distortion

      A military victory mounted on innocent ground


      [Chorus 1]

      Hearing voices from miles away

      Saying things never said

      Seeing shadows in the light of the day

      Waging a war inside my head


      [Verse 2]

      Years and years of

      Bloodshed and warfare

      Our mission was only to get in and kill

      A free vacation

      Of palmtrees and shrapnel

      Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell


      [Chorus 1]


      [Chorus 2]

      Feeling strangers staring my way

      Reading minds never read

      Tasting danger with each word I say

      Waging a war inside my...


      [IV. The Test That Stumped Them All]

      [Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]


      [Verse]

      Standing in the darkness

      Waiting for the light

      The smell of pure adrenaline

      Burning in the night

      Random blinding flashes

      Aiming at the stage

      Intro tape begins to roll

      Igniting sonic rage

      Still they keep me between these hollow walls

      Hoping to find in me

      The answers to the test that stumped them all

      "The boy is simply crazy

      Suffering from delusions

      We honestly think that maybe

      He might need an institution

      He lives in a world of fiction

      And really could use some help

      We have just the place to fix him

      To save him from himself"

      Curled up in the darkness

      Searching for the light

      The smell of stale sweat and shit

      Streaming through the night

      Random urine testing

      Pills red, pink and blue

      Counseling and therapy

      Providing not a clue

      Still they keep me between these hollow walls

      Hoping to find in me

      The answers to the test that stumped them all

      "We can''t seem to find the answers

      He seemed such a clear cut case

      We cannot just let him leave here

      And put all this work to waste

      Why don''t we try shock treatment

      It really might do some help

      We have just the tools to fix him

      To save him from himself"


      [V. Goodnight Kiss]

      [Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]


      [Verse]

      Goodnight kiss in your nightgown

      Lavender in your bed

      So innocent as you lie down

      Sweet dreams that run through your head

      Are you lonely without mommy''s love?

      I want you to know I''d die for that moment

      You''re just a poor girl

      Afraid of this cruel world

      Taken away from it all

      It''s been 5 years to the day and

      My tainted blood''s still the same

      I can''t help acting this way and

      Those bastard doctors are gonna pay

      I''m so lonely without baby''s love

      I want you to know I''d die for one more moment

      I''m just a poor girl

      Afraid of this cruel world

      Taken away from it all


      [VI. Solitary Shell]

      [Lyrics: John Petrucci]


      [Verse]

      He seemed no different from the rest

      Just a healthy normal boy

      His mama always did her best

      And he was daddy''s pride and joy

      He learned to walk and talk on time

      But never cared much to be held

      And steadily he would decline

      Into his solitary shell

      As a boy he was considered somewhat odd

      Kept to himself most of the time

      He would daydream in and out of his own world

      But in every other way he was fine

      He''s a monday morning lunatic

      Disturbed from time to time

      Lost within himself

      In his solitary shell

      A temporary catatonic

      Madman on occasion

      When will he break out

      Of his solitary shell

      He struggled to get through his day

      He was helplessly behind

      He poured himself onto the page

      Writing for hours at a time

      As a man he was a danger to himself

      Fearful and sad most of the time

      He was drifting in and out of sanity

      But in every other way he was fine

      He''s a monday morning lunatic

      Disturbed from time to time

      Lost within himself

      In his solitary shell

      A momentary maniac

      With casual delusions

      When will he be let out

      Of his solitary shell


      [VII. About to Crash (reprise)]

      [Lyrics: John Petrucci]


      [Verse]

      I''m alive again

      The darkness far behind me

      I''m invincible

      Despair will never find me

      I feel strong

      I''ve got a new sense of elation

      Boundless energy

      Euphoria fixation

      Still it''s hard to just get by

      It seems so meaningless to try

      When all i want to do is cry

      Who would ever know i felt so sad

      Even though i get so high

      I know that i will never fly

      And when i fall out of the sky

      Who''ll be standing by

      Will you be standing by


      [VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale]

      [Lyrics: John Petrucci]


      [Verse]

      She dresses in black everyday

      She keeps her hair simple and plain

      She never wears makeup

      But no one would care if she did anyway

      She doesn''t recall yesterday

      Faces seem twisted and strange

      But she always wakes up

      Only to find she''d been miles away

      Absence of awareness

      Losing time

      A lapse of perception

      Losing time

      Wanting to escape

      She had created a way to survive

      She learned to detach from herself

      A behavior that kept her alive


      Hope in the face of our human distress

      Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside

      That takes hold of our lives

      Shame and disgrace over mental unrest

      Keeps us from saving those we love

      The grace within our hearts

      And the sorrow in our souls

      Deception of fame

      Vengeance of war

      Lives torn apart

      Losing oneself

      Spiraling down

      Feeling the walls closing in

      A journey to find

      The answers inside

      Our elusive mind'
