The gameplay is so simplistic, I hope the dev would add some items to enhance the game, like: Timestop, Paralyze the Guard, etc etc.\n\nThe game has a potential and could do better.","timestamp_created":1607838526,"timestamp_updated":1607838526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwo52prfYCeKvduQI="}
