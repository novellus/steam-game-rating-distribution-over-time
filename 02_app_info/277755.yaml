      \ the successful introduction of the Intercity-Express system across Germany\
      \ in the early 1990s, Deutsche Bahn started plans to upgrade long distance services\
      \ with higher speeds and raise comfort levels for passengers, and to replace\
      \ locomotive-hauled regional services.<br><br>These developments resulted in\
      \ three new ICE trains being built \u2013 the ICE 3, ICE T and ICE VT, the latter\
      \ \u2018VT\u2019 standing for Verbrennungstriebwagen (internal combustion motor\
      \ car). All three trains were developed alongside each other and shared common\
      \ components and layout \u2013 noticeable differences on the ICE VT were its\
      \ crescent-shaped bogie supports and the removal of pantographs.<br><br>The\
      \ ICE VT \u2013 later to be more commonly known as the ICE TD \u2013 was built\
      \ by a Bombardier and Siemens consortium, and a four-car configuration chosen,\

    review: "Der ICE TD macht im Stand Ger\xE4usche, wie man sie bei einer Dampflok\
      \ vermuten w\xFCrde. Die f\xFCr einen Zug dieser Art obligatorische AFB ist\
      \ extrem fummelig zu bedienen - das kann jede Basis-Lok besser. Die Beleuchtung\
      \ funktioniert bei mir nicht: Bei aktiviertem Spitzensignal leuchtet lediglich\
      \ die Stirnlampe, weder die Pufferlampen noch der Zugschluss leuchten.\nDeinstalliert,\
      \ R\xFCckgabe beantragt."
