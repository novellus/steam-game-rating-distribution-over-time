    short_description: Prepare yourself for the ultimate, &quot;run till you die&quot;
      game, which pits you against a maniacal programmer - a smart AI that intuitively
      adapts to your level of gameplay. Prove you're not just another one of his &quot;guinea
      pigs&quot; as he throws ever increasingly complex challenges at you. His goal
      is your frustration.
