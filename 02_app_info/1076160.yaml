      \ /><br><br>The first release of Command rocked the foundations of modern PC\
      \ wargaming, steamrolled its way into the Pentagon and won numerous &quot;Wargame\
      \ Of The Year&quot; awards. Now, the restless rascals at WarfareSims are back\
      \ at it with a vengeance! The already legendary game of modern cross-domain\
      \ operations returns with an all-new UI, even more refined simulation mechanics\
      \ and a host of new features and content to engross you into the challenges\
      \ of warfare post-WW2 and in the 21st century. Are you <strong>ready</strong>?\
      \ Are you<strong> up to it</strong>?<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/1-Command-MO.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br>No man, and no armed service, is an island. Aircraft, ships, submarines,\
      \ ground forces and installations, satellites and even strategic weapons are\
      \ at your disposal. You are given the forces and their hardware; but you have\
      \ to direct them wisely.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/2-Command-MO.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br>You asked for a faster, smoother earth-globe interface with richer,\
      \ even more detailed map layers - and you got it! Over half a terabyte's worth\
      \ of satellite imagery and terrain elevation combine to deliver an unprecedentedly\
      \ crisp battlefield for your forces to roam.   <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/3-Command-MO.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br>Command's new slick, dark-themed UI slams you right into the seat of\
      \ a modern-day military command center and never lets go. Play in desktop-standard\
      \ window or gamelike full-screen mode. Arrange your secondary info windows just\
      \ how you like them - or park them into extra monitors. Customize your map and\
      \ info windows to perfection to suit your play style.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/4-Command-MO.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br>Hundreds of changes and additions to gameplay based directly on user\
      \ feedback means the game is now yours more than ever. Minimaps? Check. Quickly\
      \ load recent scenarios or saves? Yup. Real-time dynamic ORBATs of both friendly\
      \ forces and known contacts? Yessir. Time-step sim execution to prevent \u201C\
      runaway sim\u201D? Can do. Glorious victories or crushing defeats have never\
      \ felt so easy to experience.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/5-Command-MO.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br>Don\u2019t spend too long gawking at the pretty maps, because the battlefield\
      \ is even more alive and ready to crush you! Expanded ground ops let you take\
      \ advantage of distinct terrain types (desert, forest, urban, swamps etc.) for\
      \ mobility, weapon effects and visibility. Enhanced AI routines for dogfights\
      \ and even more technical factors make your grip on air superiority more tenuous.\
      \ The groundbreaking features of the \u201CChains Of War\u201D campaign are\
      \ now standard: Disrupt your enemy\u2019s communications to isolate his units\
      \ (but watch out for your own), perform scriptless amphibious, airdrop or pickup\
      \ operations, watch as aircraft limber back shot almost to pieces and marvel\
      \ at exotic new weaponry.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/2-Command-MO_img.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/6-Command-MO.jpg?t=1604337306\"\
      \ /><br>Even at the dawn of unmanned systems, combat is not a dry hardware comparison.\
      \ Your war machines are crewed or remote-controlled by human beings: people\
      \ trained with varied proficiency (from novice to ace), operating under custom\
      \ doctrine and rules of engagement (when to do what, how to decide, how to react\
      \ etc.), most of the time making the rational decision, and sometimes making\
      \ a brilliant call or a mistake. These people often matter far more than the\
      \ hardware. The deadliest combat units are only as sharp as their crews.<br><br><img\

      \ World War 3. Desert Storm. India &amp; Pakistan. The Arctic circle. Past and\

      \ in more than 600 official and community scenarios. Test your mettle against\
      \ lethal land-based missile batteries, air regiments, naval fleets or pirate\

    reviews: "\u201CC: MO takes what was already a great system, and makes it several\
      \ notches better. There is simply nothing else out there like it. It's game\
      \ where you can convincingly simulate a naval battle from 1950, an air-to-air\
      \ combat in 1967, and a submarine duel in 1985 all within one unified system.\u201D\
