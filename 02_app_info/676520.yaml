    review: "If you are intrigued by its strange and rather unique style you should\
      \ give it a try.\nIts around an hour long and for its price I was entertained\
      \ enough.\n\nAs someone who has played \"Piece of Memory\", I simply had to\
      \ know how this would continue.\nThis loosely continues the story of the previous\
      \ game but can be followed regardless of whether you played the first game or\
      \ not.\n\nThe title menu music is still by far the best part of the entire game.\
      \ You can find all the music and ambient tracks as wavesound files in the installation\
      \ folder.\n\nThe controls are still as awkward as in the first game but not\
      \ impossible to get used to. You move with the mouse by clicking on directional\
      \ prompts that appear on the screen.\n\nThe gameplay mostly revolves around\
      \ traveling and exploration. \nYou are a cat and walk around an area with the\
      \ girl. Listen to their conversation for instructions, clues and the story.\
      \ Find certain key items to progress.\nThere are some simple turn based RPG\
      \ elements but with a little strategy you'll be able to easily dispose of your\
      \ enemies.\n\nFrom what I can tell the Japanese voice acting is good. The English\
      \ subtitles not so much but its not complete gibberish. I'd almost say the translation\
      \ has a certain charm to it.\n\nTo prevent frustration I recommend to frequently\
      \ save. There will be events happening that might end in a Game Over.\n\nIt\
      \ ended on quite a cliffhanger but there is definitely a lot of creativity that\
      \ went into this. \nAnd that is something I can always appreciate."
