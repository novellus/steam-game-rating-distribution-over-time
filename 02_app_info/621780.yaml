    review: 'it''s fun, i just really don"t like the part where the cow become meat
      and the part were you put poor chiken in cages.


      it''s just few mini games but they work well and they are all fun  and the possibility
      to play  at 2 players in local is a +.


      you won''t play it 15h alone but you might play half of this with siblings or
      friends.


      Worth it to me'
