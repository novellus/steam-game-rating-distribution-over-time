      \ einfach spielen ! xDD\nIch hab jetzt nur ein paar Minuten gespielt und kann\
      \ jetzt schon sagen...Wow!\nIrgendwie ist das Spiel verdammt Unheimlich!\n1.\
      \ Meine Gesamte Gallery ist schon Frei geschaltet....100%\n2. Da sind Spielerst\xE4\
      nde schon vorhanden obwohl ich das Spiel erst heute habe...?? Von 2018 bis 2017...\n\
      3. Die Bilder sind Bugy, man klickt drauf und es erscheint ein ganz anderes?\n\
      4. Die \xDCberg\xE4nge im Spiel ...Sind seltsame verschwommenes gewische...creepy\n\
      5. Teilweise der Text ist noch auf der Orginal Sprache \n\n\nNaja Rest folgt...~\
      \ \nEin sehr seltsames Spiel wobei das Fanart sch\xF6n ist und die Story halbwegs\
      \ Spannend Anf\xE4ngt"
