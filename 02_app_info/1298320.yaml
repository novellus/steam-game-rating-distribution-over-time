      the Galaxy Cat repaired the planets, but they were too large to collect the

    review: 'Well-polished and difficult. Great 2D pixel art, clever mechanics introduced
      at each "world". Many of the levels are superbly designed. Reminds me of AAA
      titles in the same genre, like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy. I am only OK at these
      kinds of games and could not complete all levels (although I always feel like
      I can see how to get through, my timing''s just bad), but "Skip Level" helps
      mitigate frustration.


      Graphics and animations are just cute. (Try the up/down buttons some time.)
      Distinguishing collectibles in front of certain backgrounds is sometimes a bit
      tricky but it suits the game''s theme and you get used to it quickly enough.'
