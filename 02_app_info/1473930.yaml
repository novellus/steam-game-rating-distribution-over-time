    review: "Great game, \ni really enjoyed playing this game, and still have not\
      \ finished it, but so far the game runs smooth, creepy ambient that keeps you\
      \ tense most of the time, and the scares are just right, the puzzles start off\
      \ slowly and easy to understand, there is no mystery there, but the combination\
      \ of puzzles and fear it offers makes you feel an accomplishment each time you\
      \ progress, solve a puzzle or reach a new checkpoint where you can take a breather\
      \ and get ready for what is next.\nI'm looking forward to finishing this game\
      \ and seeing the new areas, and what it has to offer.\nwell done! recommended!"
