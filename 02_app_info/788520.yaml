    review: "Pros:\n-The voice acting. It's bad but in an endearing way. [spoiler]Like\
      \ there's a part where the monster is chasing you and it's supposed to be growling-but\
      \ honest to god it just sounds like a grown man meowing at you.[/spoiler]\n\
      -Art is good\n-backgrounds are intersting enough\n-The plot is interesting enough\
      \ to keep you entertained\n-I actually liked the characters well enough \n\n\
      Cons:\n-the end?? Like i have no idea if i got the wrong end or something but\
      \ its [spoiler]pretty much just a cliff hanger that never gets resolved.[/spoiler]\
      \ Who knows. Maybe he's planning a sequel or something\n-So. Much. Walking.\
      \ Abdulla, my guy, you do not need to use that many paths. Especially if you're\
      \ going to have the player use the entire map the whole game\n-Some of the puzzles\
      \ were infuriating \n-I know everyone has mentioned this before but the writing\
      \ on the ground is corny as hell\n\nIn conclusion: For a first game its pretty\
      \ good. if you have four bucks to spare and enough energy to slog through the\
      \ tedious parts (*coughcough* walking *coughcough*), then go for it."
