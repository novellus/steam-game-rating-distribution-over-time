But now about this eco-friendly game: it may look like a mobile game - which it actually also is - but there's more to it. It's educational, perfect for kids, and there are many little challenges. But no brainless thinking! There's also enough variation and it isn't short, so you won't get bored.\n\nThese little water-facts, many achievements and the ClearWater-themed story add something extra to the game. [i]Water Heroes[/i] has this cozy \"indie team atmosphere\" which you can experience in the funny sound effects and visual style. Plus, it's a fair price, considered that it's actually 50% of what you pay. Now give it a try!","timestamp_created":1488921505,"timestamp_updated":1489219034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61060100793838501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwueOX3toCf4Dycw=="}
