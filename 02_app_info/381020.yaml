    review: 'After over 500 flight hours with this game, I''m going to warn you: If
      you enjoy arcade aerial combat, prepare to be [b]hooked[/b]. This is easily
      one of the most addictive games I''ve ever played.


      So first things first, what are we dealing with here? Well, I would personally
      make comparisons to the [i]Ace Combat[/i] franchise; but, if I''m honest, [i]Sky
      Rogue[/i] makes most other air combat games look [b]slow[/b] in comparison:
      if [i]Ace Combat[/i] is [i]Call of Duty[/i], [i]Sky Rogue[/i] is basically 90s
      [i]DooM[/i] by comparison. Seriously, it''s [b]that[/b] fast.


      So basically, you''re a lone pilot fighting for some nebulous "Aeroforce" against
      some "Crimson State" and its poorly defined allies. The thing is, death is not
      the end: Every time you get shot down, you get to unlock new planes and weapons
      that can enable you to fight further until you confront this massive boss machine
      that the enemy forces have been cooking up.


      You''ve got three roles of aircraft: versatile and agile Fighters, lightning-fast
      Interceptors that specialize in air-to-air, and slow but durable Bombers that
      excel in air-to-ground; and they come in the classes of faster but more fragile
      Lights, well-rounded Mediums, Swing-Wings that give you even [b]more[/b] versatility
      than the Mediums at the expense of a little durability, tough and heavily armed
      Heavies, and powerful Experimentals. The weapons on offer cover all the bases,
      with unguided rockets, bombs and machine guns; various air-to-air and air-to-ground
      guided missiles; and even a handful of large caliber cannons with high damage
      but requiring more skill in their use.


      In general, the controls are excellent. The game allows you to completely rebind
      [b]every[/b] control that you can use, making it easy to set up most gamepads
      or flight sticks. And as mentioned before, this game is [b]fast[/b]: Especially
      after upgrading them, every aircraft in the game feels [b]extremely[/b] responsive;
      and the weapons all feel quite powerful, with the effects for hitting and destroying
      enemies sending small pieces of material scattering in all directions(though
      you never actually blast holes in them, sadly).


      But the real rabbit hole with this game isn''t the gameplay itself, as crazy
      as that sounds. No, we need to talk about mod support. If you''ve got the software
      and the know-how, you can create almost anything: new playable aircraft [b]including[/b]
      support for custom aircraft stats, new weapons with custom models and abilities,
      entire new [b]missions[/b] with their own environmental color palettes. They''ve
      got tons of stuff in the Workshop, and the possibilities are almost literally
      endless here. There are various crafts from various shmups, movies, other games,
      silly stuff like literal flying tanks, modern and historic real-life aircraft,
      you name it. If you''re ever feeling nostalgic for the old [i]Star Wars: Rogue
      Squadron[/i] games, they''ve got multiple [i]Star Wars[/i] starfighters in there
      waiting for you. Or you could bring the squadrons of [i]Ace Combat[/i] into
      this game with various skins and aircraft from that.


      In all, [i]Sky Rogue[/i] is an [b]excellent[/b] air combat game, and anyone
      who likes arcade air combat [b]must[/b] play this game at some point in their
      lives. I can''t praise this game enough. [b] 10 out of 10.[/b]'
