As such, gameplay is relatively straight-forward. I.e. move your troops and hope the dice/RNG decide in your favor. Recommend to those who enjoy this sort of thing.","timestamp_created":1606431493,"timestamp_updated":1606431493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uOmxg/YCeP3/sgI="}
