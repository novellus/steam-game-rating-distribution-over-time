If they add more of the French and British fighters at spawn points and give you just a few more planes in this pack i would say get it, but with what they give you i would stay away from this pack and game all together and go buy foxhole with that $20 instead they deserve it.","timestamp_created":1554070860,"timestamp_updated":1554070860,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwju716ukCfqGlvgE="}
