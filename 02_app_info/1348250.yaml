    about_the_game: Grab some nearby friends or play solo in this top-down, twin-stick
      shooter game! Choose a cute animal character to pilot your tank as you make
      your way through each level. Your tank will have unlimited bullets and 3 mines
      at your disposal for each mission you undertake. Levels are divided into several
      missions, and if you die before the level is complete, you must start it back
      at the beginning! Discover new locations with each level, and perhaps some scary
      beasts to slay as well!<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Select
      a level you've unlocked from the level map to start a level.<br></li><li>Choose
      one of several characters to pilot your tank.<br></li><li>Levels are made of
      several sub-levels called Missions where you must defeat all enemies to progress.<br></li><li>Use
      your infinite supply of bullets and 3 mines per Mission to take out the enemy
      forces.<br></li><li>Combat is top-down view with twin-stick controls. Use the
      left stick or WASD to move around and the right stick or IJKL to aim your tank's
      barrel.<br></li><li>Team up with friends in local co-op to help beat levels.<br></li><li>Beating
      the latest level available on the map will unlock the next one.<br></li><li>An
      optional Deathmatch mode in the menu allows for last-man-standing combat between
      other local players.</li></ul>
