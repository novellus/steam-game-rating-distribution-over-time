    review: "This really is a \"your mileage may vary\" kind of game. \n\nThe game\
      \ does have some issues but for me they all balanced out with the fact its an\
      \ indie game from a non english developer at a very low price point. What lost\
      \ me in the end was the gore, the story could have been told the exact same\
      \ way without it, and the way it was used seemed to just be trying to gross\
      \ you out with it for shock value. \n\nUltimately while I wouldnt recommend\
      \ the game I wouldnt say its bad, it just isnt for me, which is unfortunate\
      \ because I thought the premise was very interesting."
