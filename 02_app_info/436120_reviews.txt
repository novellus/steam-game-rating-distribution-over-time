So you'll be renting out a small army or be giving them a large one (20 units max) for free. 3rd, you must micromanage your army to linkup with the AI army. 4th, if your army isn't effective or takes to long getting to the battlefield that nation will break the contract. I believe it also hurts relations, but I could be wrong about this. \n-The whole process is just too much micromanagement and I can't be bothered with it.    \n\nTrade Leagues:\n-Haven't tried yet and again the AI doesn't seem too effective with them. \n\nOverall:\n-I guess it gives you a few more ways to wage war, but all the micromanaging you have to do just isn't worth it.","timestamp_created":1608790519,"timestamp_updated":1608954057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ktLIzvYCf6XYvAI="}
