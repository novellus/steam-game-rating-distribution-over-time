It reminded me on BattleTanx on the N64, and that instantly earned points from me.\n\nThe controls are a little wonky (Mainly sensitivity), but are easily tailored to whatever you are used to.\nThe biggest complaint I had was that the music would randomly stop and start, but it made very little impact on the game. Here's ~20 minutes of me enjoying myself with a free Stream Key to whoever redeems it first.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7fC_iKNmYg&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1508073296,"timestamp_updated":1508073296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611440837383270264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiIqLkN8CeNuuiAE="}
