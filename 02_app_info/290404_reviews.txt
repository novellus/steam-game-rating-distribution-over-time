The first three types are easy to craft/find and nothing special. Fight some monsters and you can get them. You can craft the other three later in the campaign. This DLC adds unnecessary \"advantages\" that you can easily get on your own. You only need these jewels on the Expert difficulty and even then you find plenty of them in the game...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the Tumbled Oculi Pack install it on Steam and then launch the game while having uPlay on. It should ask you if you want to add it to your uPlay account and then confirm once you are in the game. You also have to start a new save in order for these rewards to appear.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1586258273,"timestamp_updated":1586259399,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lbKbqvECdbHw/gE="}
