    short_description: Nebulous is a physics-based puzzle game where you must help
      guide Commander Dash Johnson, a trapped astronaut, through maze-like levels,
      seeking the next wormhole to his eventual freedom. Arrange the pieces so that
      when he falls, gravity guides him safely (and probably painfully) to the end!

    review: "I don't think VR adds anything to this game.  In fact, it's probably\
      \ better played on a mobile phone.  If this were a .99 cents game, I don't think\
      \ I would rate negatively.  It's an okay puzzle game with some funny voice one-liners.\
      \  There is something funny about seeing an astronaut getting pummeled through\
      \ puzzle obstacles.  \n\nBut at $14.99 it's just crazy for this type of 'puzzle\
      \ game' if you can call it that.  It's more like angry birds.  Except the VR\
      \ adds nothing, except clunky controls.  I got it on sale for $5.09 USD and\
      \ that's way too much still.\n\nRating 3/10 content does not match prize, but\
      \ it would be a pretty good .99 cents mobile game if it were that"
