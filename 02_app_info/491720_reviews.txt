Having to jump over the terrain is easy, at least it would be if that's the only thing you had to do. You also must press the correct arrow keys to kill enemies. I struggled at first to make my do both. Like when you first wake up in the morning and can't talk and make your breakfast at the same time. However, the concept of the game is awesome! It's so much fun once you feel yourself doing both. It's like you mastered some weird skill you'll never need ever again.\n\nFor a budget game, Nary is great and perfect for a few hours of fun. It's not going to take very long to complete all the levels. Especially if you find a couple items to help you out. There's a strange system where you use a currency that can spin a random shop wheel. The strange part is how you get the currency because I couldn't even begin to tell you. Not all the items are in the shop either. They become unlocked somehow? There's a lot of mystery around this part of the game and it doesn't matter. It isn't the focus of Nary.\n\nWhile the gameplay is good the menus are cumbersome. I chose an item that only gave me two lives so I had to keep going back to the menu to try again. Which doesn't matter since the game starts you at the beginning of the level anyway? I can't see any reason for the game to give lives out at all. So it's a hassle to go back to the main menu to try again. I can see reaching a point where I'm too tired of all the menus to continue playing.\n\nAlso, I think the icons on the enemies could be a little bigger.\n\nOverall, Nary is good for a budget game. A little rough in some of the menus/music areas and the gameplay could use some refinement. Still, if you want a challenge for your mind to fingers abilities then this is for you. I want to see Nary 2 with bigger ideas, more user testing, and better menus.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26701155-The-Pepp-Selection] Click to see my curator for more reviews!
