      \ as you assume the roles of your favorite characters from the show, and confront\
      \ the horrors and humanity of this apocalyptic new world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >RECLAIM YOUR HUMANITY</h2> The war with the Saviors has finally come to an\
      \ end, but the damage lingers in the hearts of those who survived it. It will\
      \ take risk and sacrifice to mend this broken society and rebuild what remains\
      \ of Alexandria for future generations. Are prepared to do your part?<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">STEP INTO AMC\u2019S THE WALKING DEAD</h2>Play as Rick, Daryl, Michonne,\
      \ and Carol and set up your home base in the Alexandria Safe Zone. Here, you\u2019\

      \ your player stats, modify and customize weapons, trade in resources to grow\
      \ your community, and interact with your favorite characters. Successfully complete\

      \ or fight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CAMPAIGN STORY</h2>Play as Daryl Dixon through\
      \ an original campaign story about a supply run gone awry and an ensuing encounter\
      \ with a watchful stranger in a mysterious town."

      notes: 'The Walking Dead Onslaught depicts grotesque, disfigured and dismembered
        "walkers" which players can kill, often violently, by shooting, stabbing,
        severing, bludgeoning, delimbing, decapitating, blowing up with explosive,
        and more. These actions happen frequently, and the impact of these actions
        are visually depicted with graphic and intense blood and gore effects. '
