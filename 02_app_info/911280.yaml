    about_the_game: In this VR game you will get to experience the thrill of shooting
      at dinosaurs! Doing this while immersed in virtual reality takes the fun of
      gunning down giant creatures to the next level! You begin with a few casual
      hunts to go after harmless herbivores. Once you gain a bit of experience with
      shooting and earn some cash to buy bigger guns, you can go on missions to take
      down much more dangerous prey that won't just run away at the sight of your
      pistol! Happy hunting!

    review: 'I thought I had hit rock bottom when I received Chicken VR in a bundle,
      oooohhhhhh noooooooooo little did I know that worse was to come. Welcome to
      dinosaur hunter VR where you will wish you were the first to be killed and eaten
      in a Jurassic Park movie by the time you load the first hunt.


      It''s basic, not much fun and amateurish, if killing Dino from the Flintstones
      with one shot while stuck in place has been a fantasy of yours. Then throw that
      Three dollars at the screen and yell yabba dabba doo dooo otherwise if you received
      in a bundle. Do what I''m doing let it fall down the back of your steam library
      and forget it existed.
