    about_the_game: The Leprechaun is back in the hood, all blazed up and seeking
      revenge! When a group of friends discover his treasure, they soon find out they've
      unleashed a can of demented whoop ass! With their stack of riches, they go from
      poor to ghetto-fabulous overnight, spending their newfound loot on pimped-out
      cars and hair extensions. One by one the friends stand up to the weed-smoking,
      knife-wielding, car-stealing leprechaun who will stop at nothing to get his
      treasure back. Evil has a whole new rap and the kids from the hood had better
      watch their backs!

    review: 'This was such a good downgrade, it''s unbelievable. The movie doesn''t
      shelter a soul. You can''t show feelings to it. It''s ugly. There isn''t much
      thought put into it. It''s like not a part of the Trilogy: Forced and lame jokes,
      casual and uninspiring score, stereotyped and predictable plot, cheesy and generic
      writing, undeveloped villain, inappropriate atmosphere, wrong character development...
      I mean how does one go from this ''''Tell me, do you bleed'''' to this ''''There''s
      something definitely bleeding'''' It''s like a ''joke''. Who wrote this garbage?
      I mean why, what was your motive?


      Apart from the garbage writing, the coloring sucked too. The whole movie was
      ugly as hell. After Superman''s resurrection, the fight scene was completely
      miss edited. Why is the sun rising? Do you guys wanted it to make more colorful?
      Is because Superman takes his power from the sun? Because of this garbage coloring,
      the VFX and the CGI looked garbage.
