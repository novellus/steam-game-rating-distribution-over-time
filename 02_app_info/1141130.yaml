      /><br>Serious Scramblers features a colorful cast of unlock-able characters,
      each changing the game in significant ways. Here are some examples:<h2 class="bb_tag">Motoko
      - Time jumper</h2><br>Like a certain innovative FPS, time only moves when Motoko
      moves. There is a catch however, the level scrolls a lot faster when time isn't
      paused - so, unless you want to get skewered by the ceiling spikes, you'll have
      to make each move carefully!<h2 class="bb_tag">Silhouette - Gotta go fast</h2><br>Silhouette
      moves at top speed at all times, so avoiding spike traps is as easy as A, B,
      and C! However, the trade-off is that there will be significantly lesser gold
      coins to collect.<h2 class="bb_tag">Mummy - Gold Grabber</h2><br>Fancy getting
      more coins to unlock more characters? Mummy's the one to choose. It's worth
      noting that Mummy is one of the slowest characters though!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1141130/extras/devnote_label.png?t=1574704319"
      /><br>Serious Scramblers is a highly challenging, yet simple game originally
      released on the iOS. While it has gotten a modest number of downloads on the
      platform, less than 1 percent of players have beaten the final boss. This led
      me to wonder how gamers on Steam would fare. Consequently, I decided to port
      Serious Scramblers to the PC while using this opportunity to touch up various
      graphical aspects of the game. It is a tiny and simple game, but I poured my
      heart into it! <strong>If you like a challenge, consider getting this game!</strong><br><br>I
      welcome all forms of feedback on the Steam forums, discord, and twitter! Thank
      you!
