    about_the_game: "The famous General Electric \u2018U-Boat\u2019 comes to Train\
      \ Simulator in two distinctive Seaboard liveries.<br>General Electric introduced\
      \ its \u201CUniversal Series\u201D diesel road-switchers in 1959, and over the\
      \ following two decades more than 3,500 \u201CU-Boats\u201D - as the locomotives\
      \ were nicknamed \u2013 were constructed. The final and most  powerful four-axle\
      \ (B-B) model in GE\u2019s U-Boat line was the 3,600-horsepower U36B built from\
      \ 1969 through 1974.   <br><br>Constructed primarily for the Seaboard Coast\
      \ Line (which owned 108 of the total 125 built), the U36B was put to work on\
      \ SCL\u2019s fastest and heaviest freight hauls, but it was also versatile enough\
      \ to handle almost any duty. Seaboard Coast Line was merged into the Seaboard\
      \ System Railroad in 1982 and SCL\u2019s fleet of U36Bs continued to serve in\
      \ mainline duty into the 1990s, after which a number found further work on U.\
      \ S. short lines.  <br><br>The GE U36B for Train Simulator is available in Seaboard\
      \ Coast Line and Seaboard System liveries. Features of the model include EMD-style\
      \ Blomberg trucks as were used on all SCL\u2019s U36Bs, rear headlight control,\
      \ gyralight control, forward headlight control and classification lights. Accompanying\
      \ the U36B are SCL\u2019s noted yellow-liveried covered hoppers and a Seaboard\
      \ Coast Line M-5 caboose, each of which are ideally suited for service with\
      \ this historic  U-boat.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible,\
      \ giving you the freedom to drive the Seaboard U36B on any Quick Drive enabled\

      \ details, such as one unit having a gyra-light, and the other one doesn\u2019\
      t \n-Dim, bright, and emergency controls for the gyra-light \n-Class lights\n\
      -Realistic physics\n-Okay-sounding bell\n-Accurate EMD Blomberg trucks from\
      \ traded in units\n-Number boards look nice\n-You can open the doors and windows\
      \ on the cab\n-Individual wiper motor control \n-Moving sun visors \n\nWhat\
      \ I don\u2019t like\n-Default sounds. Good god, this is a DTG product, of course,\
      \ we need reused sounds...\n-It has a really bad K5LA off of the Pacific Surfliner\
      \ \n-Engine sounds are from the default Kuju ES44. Not that bad but come on\n\
      -Okay bell\n\nI'd give it a 6.5/10\nWrite a comment if you have a question"
