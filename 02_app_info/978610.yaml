      \ bases are developing if other players haven't closed access to their bases\
      \ for you. You can also close access to your base for other players so that\
      \ only you can watch the development of your base. During the launch of this\
      \ mode, your computer\u2019s resources are used by the game AI to develop the\
      \ base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the second game mode, you explore the world as\
      \ a robot disconected from AI network, extracting resources and helping NPCs\
      \ to develop bases or traveling the world and fighting against zombies and robots."
