    about_the_game: Icebound is a steampunk fantasy visual novel and puzzle game in
      a world that has fallen into the depths of a thousand-year ice age. Alchemy
      is a very real ability to manipulate the forces of nature and machines run using
      clockworks and steam. Humans have united under a mighty continent-wide empire
      that seeks to harness the power of alchemy, while the horned race of ferans
      lives in tenuous peace.<br><br>The wandering alchemist named Dougal wields the
      power of fire, which is often shunned as an evil omen, so he never stays in
      the same place too long. During his travels, he winds up in Isenbarr, an isolated
      frontier town. When he tries to find a job there, he stumbles upon a mysterious
      challenge with a potentially priceless reward, and several other alchemists
      vying for the prize. With a monster plaguing the town, he must use all the alchemical
      skills at his disposal to prove that fire can truly survive in this world of
      endless ice. But what is the monster, and why is it here? The truth may be more
      related to Dougal himself than he believes...<h2 class="bb_tag">Novel-length

      notes: The visual novel contains a number of battle scenes which are not graphic,
        but violence is described in text. A female character appears in her lingerie
        in certain scenes and an optional scene contains implied sex. Characters are
        depicted drinking alcohol in a tavern. There are absolutely no deaths by robotic
        sabercat anywhere in this game... really, I swear!

    review: "Not a bad game, not a great game but pretty good compared to most steam\
      \ VN in my opinion.\nPlenty of choices in the game and different endings..tho\
      \ a lack of romance options i am happy \nthat there atleast was one in the game.The\
      \ puzzle game is not to hard and not to easy, perfect for \nme."
