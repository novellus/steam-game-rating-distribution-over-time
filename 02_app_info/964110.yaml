      \ cute monster girls on a 5\xD75 grid. Each player has three tiles in a hand\
      \ and takes turns placing them, capturing other adjacent tiles based on the\
      \ tile\u2019s facing value. Not only are the values of your tiles important\
      \ but also their position on the game board. The goal is to capture your opponent\u2019\
      s tiles and control the majority of the board when all spaces are filled.<br\

      \n<br />\r\n-          Cascading Captures: Enemy tiles adjacent to your captured\

    review: I really want to like this game. I was hoping for a Final Fantasy VIII
      like card game. The drawn art is okay, but the gameplay is monotonous. When
      you win you get a choice of cards you can get, but they're usually all the same.
      The only way to get better cards is to upgrade them by combining them. To get
      a card fully levelled up, you need 8 cards (meaning repeating the same battle
      8 times), but even then the upgrades are marginal. The game feels very unpolished
      and grindy. With some more love this game could be a lot more. It is entertaining
      for a while and for that reason worth its price tag, but there's no real depth
      in here.
