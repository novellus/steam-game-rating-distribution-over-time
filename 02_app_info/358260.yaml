    about_the_game: 'The game begins with Mylo rocketing to the Altairian star system
      on a simple treasure hunt. But what happens is far more dangerous than even
      Mylo bargained for. He enters an underground world of chambers full of alien
      technology and traps. Strange alien creatures and robots inhabit the caves,
      protecting the priceless crystals from money-greedy explorers.<br><br>There
      are three unique episodes to the Crystal Caves saga: &quot;The Trouble with
      Twibbles&quot;, &quot;Slugging it Out&quot;, and &quot;Mylo Verses the Supernova&quot;.
      Each episode has a unique story twist and graphics. Can you help Mylo strike
      it rich and quit his day job?<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><strong>Alien
      Acrobat</strong>: Mylo can walk up-side-down - some levels have such low gravity
      that the recoil from Mylo''s laser pistol can knock him into other dangers!
      <br><br><strong>Brave New World</strong>: Lightless levels, falling hammers,
      egg-dropping alien bats, free-roaming slither eyes, web-shooting alien spiders,
      and much, much more!<br><br><strong>Controller Support</strong>: Partial Xbox
      360 Controller support.'
