      \ have an early look at how we imagine a typical combat mission will play in\
      \ the full game. The combat itself uses an innovative delayed turn-based system,\
      \ where every action you choose on your turn, will take some time to actually\
      \ happen. Positioning is very important, and you will have to think about not\
      \ just the situation you are in right now, but of the situation, you will be,\
      \ when the action actually resolve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of the mission\
      \ itself is to save a VIP for the resistance. To accomplish this task, you will\
      \ have a small party of 6, with predetermined skills. Your enemy will be the\
      \ earth legion specialized in heavy armor and earth magic, but luckily, they\
      \ are spread thin in the region. This gives you the perfect opportunity for\
      \ a quick rescue mission. But beware, the longer the mission takes, the more\
      \ enemies will arrive on the map! Remember, that your goal is not to kill everyone,\
      \ but to save the VIP and then get to safety."
