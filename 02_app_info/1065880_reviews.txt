If you haven't played Mordor or Demise I wouldn't blame you, so in more generic terms, it's a hack and slash RPG with randomized dungeons and slightly randomized (basically elemental affinities) equipment. \n\nThis is *not* a roguelike, modern or otherwise. There is only the most cursory resource management: \"stamina\" dictates how many steps you can take in the dungeon before you start taking damage, but there are myriad ways to extend, mitigate, or ignore it. There is, of course, the ubiquitous gold, XP, and HP. Experience raises your level, progressing you along a linear track which grants passive bonuses, and also apparently gives you points to spend toward \"perks,\" though maybe this is a feature of the DLC since I've yet to find the interface for doing so.\n\nWhat's notably missing is a special resource like Mana, or even Vancian spells per day. You can cast anything at any time you want. This is extra puzzling considering you can cast your spells while outside of combat, giving you buffs that last til you leave the dungeon or rest. Except... there is no mana, so it's just about remembering to cast these, not actually making the tactical choice to use resources to cast these. In other words, why aren't these just always-on passive bonuses to relieve the tedium?\n\nWith no resource management, combat feels strange, since you just spam the ability that reports the highest damage. Magic schools are actually just big, monolithic spells, so if your character can use \"Fire Magic\" it means they can cast \"Fire,\" which does fire damage and applies a stacking burn. Each spell also comes with a side-effect, like Fire's burn, or Stone's ability to reduce the physical damage enemies can deal. But that's about it. All the spells do the same damage, so it comes down to elemental resistances and/or which debuffs you need.\n\nEach encounter seems to be the same, tactically speaking. It's you (and your pet, if you capture/summon one) versus one enemy. Never more. There is no decision on kill order, debuffs, crowd control, anything. You kill the guy in front of you. That's it.\n\nThere are a plethora of skills and stats and mechanics, mostly straight out of Mordor (but who cares since they're cool mechanics like monster capture and the Zoo), but with the rubber-to-road game being so extraordinarily basic, it's a struggle to really, well, care. There's not even a sense of actually exploring the dungeon, since it's just a 2D grid you click around on, one square at a time, that shows you an icon for fight, treasure, or event. Whoopee.\n\nIn the end, there is, overall, just not a lot here. You can do 1v1 fights ad infinitum, and get better at 1v1 fights ad infinitum, but that's about it.","timestamp_created":1607453363,"timestamp_updated":1607453363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607814007,"developer_response":"Thanks for the trying the game. If you play in more than normal mode, the decisions really make a difference in combat. The expansion, addresses some of the issues you mention. Each class gets a new feature that affects the game in a major way. There is more customization on the equipment with buffs. Additionally adds monsters that start to use skills that block you from using spell and melee attacks and other features. \n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4s/nrofYCefaeuAI="}
