I'm not quite sure what it is specifically that has caused me to sink almost 10 hours a day into the game since buying it, I believe it just has a bit of charm to it, in my few days I've been playing, there's been a few updates and a massive one (entering early access). I've had feedback from Devs who seem to be active on the Subreddit. I've made friends along the way, two of which I just crossed my first stormwall the other day with... There's a genuine sense of pride to back this community and it's developers, which obviously show they've got a passion and a vision for this game. Would love to personally be in contact more with the Devs since I have bugger all to do with my time but play Words Adrift (Bossa, sign me up guys, come on.)\n\nAside from that I've had a wonderful experience so far and it doesn't show signs of stopping anytime soon.\n\nTo the skies!","timestamp_created":1526526403,"timestamp_updated":1526526403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544641613960266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m4yEtuMCfuLAoAE="}
