Comes with a barebones story, multiple classes (some unlockable), health and mana potions with limited carry quantity, chests with upgrades for multiple inventory slots, upgradeable skills, many monster types with unique abilities, mini-map, traps, etc. Movement / combat are grid / turn-based; everything takes one move at the time the player does. Does all you could ask it to -- watch the video; that's how the game plays.","timestamp_created":1503260324,"timestamp_updated":1507159002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495730280876159668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuanr9N4CdOyTgwE="}
