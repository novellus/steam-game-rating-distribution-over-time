    review: "I mostly bought it to support the developers since the main game was\
      \ free and good, but I'm glad I got it the comic was spicy and a nice addition,\
      \ and short story was cute. Although the panel intended to introduce them was\
      \ at the very end of the pdf instead of before the comic and short story. \n\
      \nAnd the commentary on a lot of the artwork and characters were nice additions\
      \ to know if you enjoyed the main game."
