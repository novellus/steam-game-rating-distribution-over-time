    review: "Nation Breakers is a fast-paced action brawler where your goal is to\
      \ destroy your opponents with ranged and melee weapons before they can do the\
      \ same to you. \n\nThe controls are simple and easy to pickup while still allowing\
      \ for good amount of skill \u2013 most attacks can be parried or dodged with\
      \ the right timing.\n\nThe arenas themselves can be just as deadly as your opponents,\
      \ as they change during the course of the battle - that 'safe' corner you are\
      \ hiding in may become a deadly trap at any given moment. Power-ups appearing\
      \ in each arena can create some pretty hilarious situations (dynamite?!) so\
      \ you'll probably want to grab these before your opponents do.\n\nRounds quite\
      \ are short and perfect for pass-the-controller couch gameplay. Best played\
      \ locally with friends."
