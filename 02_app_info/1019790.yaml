    review: "Supernatural Super Squad Fight! is a fighting game, pitting mythical\
      \ creatures against the forces of evil to determine the face of the world. \
      \ You have the good guys: Bigfoot, Enki, Nessie and Jeff. The Evil guys are\
      \ Cl\xEDodhna, General Chad, Grandpa Krampus and Kukulkan. Each group are determined\
      \ to defeat the other side to fulfill their task, and emerge victorious with\
      \ their own personal ending.\n\nThe game is quite simple to play, as it only\
      \ requires a directional input, and 2 buttons.  One button is to jump, the other\
      \ is to attack.  You battle each foe until their health bar is depleted, and\
      \ you advance, or lose, and give it another go until all your lives are lost.\
      \  The battles consist of 4 characters, which will be determined by which character\
      \ you choose. Should you chose the Supernatural Super Squad, you'll face against\
      \ Kukulkan Forces, and vice-versa.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThe game has a very energetic\
      \ music composition, that will be a nice tune to add to the battle, but often\
      \ will be drowned by the fighters attack voices and one-liners.  Still, the\
      \ music is not much to pay mind to when battling, but it doesn't keep the momentum\
      \ of excitement while brawling.  The ending theme is well done, so that's a\
      \ good reward to enjoy when ya beat the Single Player mode. 6/10\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\
      \nThe game uses Unity to produce the background and design of the game.  I for\
      \ one, am not a guy persuaded by graphics, as long as they define to be what\
      \ they are meant to be, which it does just that.  The stages are quite large\
      \ and spacious, showing their unique qualities that a venue would provide. \
      \ The Forest stage, has trees and rocks, the Snow stage has falling snow and\
      \ mountains.  It's all there.\nThe characters are what shows more unique design\
      \ in the aspect, and they all have their design style.  Nessie is by far the\
      \ least design detailed character, while Cl\xEDodhna and Kukulkan shows the\
      \ best in anatomy build. Everyone else have their own cartoony -style design\
      \ which makes the roster have its diversity.  8/10\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nVery simple\
      \ to play, and very frustrating to get to do what you want it to do some of\
      \ the times.  I tend to mash my inputs fairly quick, which the game would acknowledge\
      \ it half the time.  The best way to get the commands to work, is to press each\
      \ combination once, and with some pause in between.  As I described before,\
      \ it only uses directional inputs and 2 buttons.  The battles can get quite\
      \ repetitive with very few directional attack input, which limits the game spectrum\
      \ of possible attack patterns.  I do hope it could be improved down the road\
      \ but as I said, very simple to play at least.  4/10\n\nREPLAYABILITY:\n\nYou\
      \ start off with Bigfoot and Cl\xEDodhna, and unlock their teams as you play\
      \ the Single Player mode.  Once you defeat the group, you'll be rewarded with\
      \ a new character.  Play the new character, lather, rinse and repeat, until\
      \ all of them are unlocked.  Once they are unlocked, you can pit them in Arena\
      \ Mode, where you can battle 2 to 4 players, either Local Multiplayer or against\
      \ the CPU.  The game can get hectic VS 2 more opponents, compared to the Single\
      \ Player mode, and that's where most of the time invested in replaying the game\
      \ will be at.  Hope that will settle for some mayhem if ya wanna beat someone\
      \ with mythical creatures!  8/10\n\nVERDICT:\n\nAll in all, this seems to be\
      \ a fun game to play and enjoy with friends, and good game to start off.  I\
      \ am pleased to have taken the time to enjoy the game and give it my honest,\
      \ not biased-driven opinion of it.\n\nIf you wanna sit and try out a new, upcoming\
      \ game with Bigfoot, Aliens and Nessie duking it out? Look no further!\n\nIf\
      \ you're looking for a game that tickles the fancy Smash style fighting game?\
      \ This is not for you. (But maybe with enough efforts and dedication to get\
      \ this game some support, it could become a worthwhile Smash-like game!)\n\n\
      I would gladly recommend this quirky fun game with others, to spread the elusivity\
      \ of mythical creatures brawling it out!"
