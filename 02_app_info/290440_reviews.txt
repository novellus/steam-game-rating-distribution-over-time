I guess just having a bug in the gelatin wasn't bad enough, and you have to ruin the whole fruit salad.  Anyway, you fight against the slices by splashing the gelatin at them, either using energy bombs or telekinetic pulses, depending on which armaments you purchase from saving up clouds of magnetic money gas.  (This story is my personal interpretation.)\n\nIt's actually kind of fun once you figure out how to build up harmonic motion to generate strong enough splashes.  Notice that your own motion compresses the gelatin in front of you.  If you take advantage of this and also save up enough magnetic money gas to get some of the pulse weapons, it becomes like a surreal shooting game.\n\nIf you pick the right settings, you can play this game with an XBox360 controller, which I definitely recommend.  On the downside, this game requires a lot of grinding to get to the decent weapons.  On the up side, it provides a new and entirely different kind of challenge than any normal arena shooter.  It totally breaks out of the gelatin mold.","timestamp_created":1599631432,"timestamp_updated":1599631432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlNPduPQCe4rboAI="}
