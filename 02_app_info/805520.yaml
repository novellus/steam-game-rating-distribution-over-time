    about_the_game: The Dwarves of Glistenveld is a 2.5D Real Time Strategy game with
      sandbox and RPG elements. Take control of a clan of Dwarves, as they mine, forage,
      build and fight to retake their homeland from a horde of greedy goblins. Will
      you unite and cooperate with the other dwarf clans? Or will you take control
      of a single clan and seek to gain power for yourself?<h2 class="bb_tag">Story:</h2><br>Goblins
      have invaded the land of Glistenveld and the dwarven city Glistenborg is besieged!
      Flanked on all sides and with their supplies cut off, the surviving dwarves
      have fled underground. Cut off and divided, the dwarves split into five clans,
      each with their own strategy to survive. Goblins are now searching the caverns
      and tunnels under the city to rid the land of all dwarves for good! Can you
      forge a new clan and unite the dwarves under one banner? Retake your homeland
      and drive out the goblin horde!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2> <br><strong>Campaign</strong><br>Play
      through a story-driven single-player campaign, as you help the dwarves drive
      out the goblins and take back their homeland!<br> <br><strong>Personality</strong><br>Every
      dwarf is unique, with a trait system and generated details that give each unit
      individual personalities, appearances and behaviours. Watch as your dwarves
      gain experience working a particular role and level up to gain new abilities!<br>

      share them on the Steam Workshop.<br> <br><strong>Mini Games</strong><br>In
      our first mini-game, Mobbit Run, you play as a brave mobbit (an underground
      critter somewhere between a mole and a rabbit) whose goal is to steal carrots
      from the goblins.

    review: I don't have much time to play games these days, but once I started I
      was hooked for several hours which went by in a flash. Looking forward to my
      next session, when I can find the time. I found the AI worked exceptionally
      well and my Dwarves behaved in the fashion which their characteristics (which
      are comprehensive and interesting) eluded to. I also found the background music
      very atmospheric and appropriately balanced. All-in-all an excellent game already,
      even though it's early access. A lot of thought has gone into this game and
      I recommend to anyone who enjoys all things Dwarvish (like I do) to become part
      of the development journey of this game.
