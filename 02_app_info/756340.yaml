    review: '[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]


      I really didn''t want to give this game a negative review because I only paid
      Pi (3.14). So I had low expecations for a mini-game VR party game in that price
      range. If one of the mini-games was fun, that would probably be enough to at
      least give it a neutral recommendation. However, there was nothing fun about
      any of the mini-games. The main game could have been fun (directing traffic),
      but I found it too clunky & frustrating to play. The side-games mini-games were
      just awful and they are not worth discussing further.


      So the main game is you''re a cop and you''re directing traffic. Each wave brings
      more mayhem. The concept and some of the execution are fine. The graphics were
      fine and the main idea was cool. However, I had lots of problems executing the
      controls for this main game. Basically, you''re supposed to direct traffic with
      your avatar hands just like a real traffic cop would. You point at the lane
      of the car and then you point towards direction of the travel lane destination.
      You also direct traffic to stop so that it doesn''t collide with cross traffic
      at the intersection. It should be that simple.


      However, although sometimes I was able to do it all in one try, usually I had
      to try two or even three times to get it to work the way I wanted. Yes, I did
      the big hand motions just like the tutorial wanted. That''s fine for the first
      few waves, but once the waves get hectic, you really can''t afford controls
      that are not 100% precise. Besides that problem, it just looked bad that the
      controls are basically pointing at the lane of the car you want to direct and
      seeing glowing circles that you press trigger to and then with the same hand
      point in the direction of travel you want it to move and see circles that you
      press trigger to get it to move. It kind of ruins all immersion.


      I would have preferred a game where you point at the car you want to move with
      one hand and then point with the other hand where you want it to go in a flowing
      motion (with no glowing circles or lasers or anything like that). You then point
      at the car you want to stop and it stops by simply pointing with the other hand
      in the same direction or waving your hands while pointing in its general direction
      (not pressing on the joystick of the Touch controls!). You get the point ...
      you basically just role play like a real traffic cop with actual hand motions
      they do to direct traffic in real life situations!


      [b]Rate 4/10. This could have been a good traffic control game with the above
      improvements I mention about how to use motion controllers better in a game
      like this. And the mini-games, I would just scrap them unless you can make them
      a lot better.[/b]'
