      to Hanwell!</h2>The Council of Hanwell is a concentrated horror experience featuring
      all the locations from Welcome to Hanwell for people that love to get right

      in a classic linear horror experience.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Council</h2>Otherwise
      known as the <strong>Hanwell Council of Public Protection</strong> or <strong>HCPP</strong>
      was formed in Hanwell almost a century ago to protect the residents from the
      newly emerging creatures referred to as Anomalies. It was a long time ago, and
      things have surely changed, in no small part thanks to <strong>The Doctor</strong>.<br><br>You
      wake up in a makeshift morgue set up in the old disused maintenance tunnels
      under Hanwell Power, you can't remember anything, but you know The Doctor had
      something to do with your situation, and he's at <strong>The Council</strong>
      So you'll set off to find him, discovering along the way the countless horrors
      of Hanwell's Anomalies and more disturbingly, Hanwell's Elite. Bad people reside
      in Hanwell and <strong>The Council</strong> is the root of it all.<br><br>There
      is something deeply unsettling about Hanwell. Unexplained noises, something
      in the corner of your eye or laying just beyond the shadows create an atmosphere
      that will keep you constantly on edge.<h2 class="bb_tag">TLDR! Gimme the Important
