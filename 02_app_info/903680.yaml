    review: 'This game has a nice aesthetic. The art is simple, but it''s charming
      and it suits the atmosphere of the game. The English can be a bit hard to figure
      out in some parts, which sometimes lends itself to the experience, but also
      makes things much harder in other places.


      A lot of the puzzles were... well, I don''t know how you''re meant to actually
      figure them out. In at least one instance, this is simply due to odd placement
      of an item (the rust remover). In others, I''m not entirely sure if it''s a
      case of the answer being lost in translation or what, but I had to watch the
      guide video to accomplish several of them. Maybe if the English was clearer,
      the puzzles would make more sense, but I can''t say for sure.


      I think the thing that frustrated me, truly, was basically having to play the
      game over again. This wouldn''t bother me if not for the confusing puzzles,
      [spoiler]as well as the shooting mini-game being impossible to beat without
      enough points to get the extra abilities. If you go through the game too fast,
      you don''t have enough of them?? It''s ridiculous to have to wait for an hour
      to have enough so you can finish (unless that''s not what "+1 for every twenty
      minutes" means??).[/spoiler]


      This game definitely has a creepy charm to it that I like, and the price is
      more than reasonable for what you get.

      The most glaring problems definitely stem from things coming off as confusing,
      whether it be from placement or wording. [spoiler]That, and I''m still not 100%
      sure you''re supposed to not be able to see anything after awhile in the shooting
      mini game.[/spoiler]


      It''s hard to say if I recommend it or not. I feel if the English was polished
      up a bit more and the puzzles were a little more clear, then I could definitely
      say yes. Since Steam doesn''t give you a middle choice, I''ll go with yes anyway,
      mostly because I have a soft spot for games like this and believe they can shine
      despite their shortcomings.'
