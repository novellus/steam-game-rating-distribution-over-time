    review: "I bought it mainly for the soundtrack,\nI think this set is over-priced,\
      \ but still pretty good.\n\n \n[h1]Here's what you get:[/h1]\n \n[olist]\n \
      \   [*] The soundtrack!\n      20 tracks in mp3 format (196 kbps)\n      Total\
      \ length: 25min06sec\n      Song length 00:09-02:16\n      Song lengh average\
      \ ~ 01:17\n     Meta data (tags): none\n\n   Good: Great music!\n   Bad: Why\
      \ such a low bitrate? and for $7 they could not even bother putting some audio\
      \ tags or album art.\n\n\n    [*] ArtBook\n   38 pages, pdf format.\n   Page\
      \ res: 1530x2000\n   Images protected? no.\n\nGood: lots of cool art, not just\
      \ devlopment art, but some nice 3d art and texture stuff too.\neven includes\
      \ how the comic was made.\n\nBad: No notes, comentary, or labels.\nit would\
      \ also be nice to see more prototypes and cut content.\n\n[*] Digital comic\n\
      \ \n  58 pages, pdf format\n  page res: 2000x1125\n  Images protected? no.\n\
      \   \n Good: Very nice artwork\n \n Bad: prety much a 1:1 retelling of the games\
      \ story, could have added some new content.\n\n[/olist]\n \n---\n\n[h1] So in\
      \ short, [/h1]\n \n if you REALLY like the music and art, you should buy this.\n\
      However $7 is kinda a bit much for how much you're getting.\nMost games charge\
      \ around $5 for the same content, and at least offer 320kbps audio. some even\
      \ offer FLAC.\n192kbps MAX for the only offical way to buy the game music is\
      \ kinda disappointing.\nAnd on top of that, the fact they could not even bother\
      \ to put any tags for song name, track number, Album, artist, etc.\nJust shows\
      \ a lack of care.\nThe whole process to convert your source audio files, and\
      \ properly tag all of them would [b]literally[/b] take 10 minutes tops.\n \n\
      I was also intrested in reading the digital comic, it's listed as a retelling\
      \ of the game's story.\nand yeah, that's it... \nIt's pretty much just all the\
      \ pannels from the cutscenes in a pdf file.\n \nthe art book is pretty cool,\
      \ if you just want to look at the art it's pretty cool.\nand since the images\
      \ are un-protected you could turn them into wallpaper images if you want.\n\
      \ \nSo after reading all this, if that sounds like $7 well spent go for it."
