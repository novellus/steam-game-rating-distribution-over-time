As someone who never minds a grind and enjoys the simplicity of slowly building your own empire or gradually meeting a scenario's requirements, I thought only time could stand in my way of eventually being addicted. \n\nI was right. But instead of being faced with a learning curve, I was disappointed to find that it just lacked basic gameplay structure. I usually get annoyed at a tutorial for explaining the obvious and can't wait to just learn by playing, but more clarification is needed in this game. It tells you how to build X, but not how it will affect Y or Z. I spent way, way too much time trying to figure out why my defenseless warrior wouldn't pick up a weapon after having made a dozen, or why no one would deliver one to him. Instead of being challenged I just became more frustrated. If this was the only annoyance that would be one thing, but that frustration is shared toward all aspects of the game as I began to realize I somehow understood less than when I started.\n\nWhat it comes down to is Valhalla Hills being a chore. You have to invest a good deal of time before *maybe* even liking the game, which defeats the purpose of getting it in the first place. I got this on sale for basically nothing, and still feel like I overpaid.","timestamp_created":1609806001,"timestamp_updated":1609807228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxp3/5/YCd+nGwAI="}
