    review: "The game is pretty nice, short and not too hard. There are some times\
      \ where you can get stuck on the puzzles as it doesn't tell you much about it,\
      \ the killer is also abnormally fast in some scenes? Other then that it's an\
      \ okay game, I played both ending A and B and the side story, with the detective.\
      \  \n\nIf you want something short and can get scared easily then try it out!"
