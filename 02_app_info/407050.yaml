    review: "E um jogo muito bom, lembra os cl\xE1ssicos de plataforma dos anos 90,\
      \ por\xE9m com um gr\xE1fico muito bonito. \xC9 um game bem desafiador e com\
      \ dificuldade relativamente alta. Precisa de paci\xEAncia e persist\xEAncia\
      \ pra avan\xE7ar o que o deixa ainda mais saudosista. \xC9 o tipo de jogo que\
      \ te instiga a jogar mais para se superar. O desafio do game \xE9 realmente\
      \ muito bom. Por\xE9m tem que ter em mente que o jogo ainda n\xE3o est\xE1 pronto,\
      \ mas o conte\xFAdo dispon\xEDvel \xE9 bem vasto e me garantiu 7 horas de jogo\
      \ Por enquanto."
