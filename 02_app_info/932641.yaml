    review: Im just going to be honest , it wasnt really that good because the tiles
      dnt fit in with the original tiles you get with the mv maker.  i may have used
      a few tiles at best and didnt bother because id have to go and fix all the tiles
      1 at a time to make it better. 1 example is a singel bed in the original mv
      tiles would take up 2 tile spaces and in this dlc a single sized bed would take
      up 4 spaces. Most times it was an even smaller object (bed) that took more tile
      space.
