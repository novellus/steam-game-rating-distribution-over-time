The music is soft and relaxing and compliments the relaxed pace. The puzzles themselves are fairly easy, with the difficulty largely coming from finding objects within the detailed backgrounds.\n\nStory-wise, it's enjoyable and enough to keep you engaged, but nothing phenomenal.\n\nI did miss some of the quality-of-life features that more recent hidden object games employ, such as maps that allow instant travel to visited areas, but not having them isn't an issue.\n\nOverall, this is a fun, relaxing game that I enjoyed.","timestamp_created":1607742205,"timestamp_updated":1607742205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xOW5qvYCcJypuQI="}
