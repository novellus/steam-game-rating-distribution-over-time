I picked this up with for between $0.50 and $1.50. For that price I'm not even mad, at the full $3, I'd be mildly irritated. \n\nThe presentation is as good as it can be for what it is. I find a lot of charm and appeal in the color choices and the general art. But, that's all things considered. It's not impressive on it own in it's own right. It also claims to have full controller support, but I can't seem how to figure it out. With a game like this it's not a deal breaker per se, but I'd enjoy it a lot more if I could just get my damn controller to work. \n\nThat said, there isn't much else to say. I would not recommend it, even at the price point. But, because of the price point, it's not fair to expect a ton out of it. If you are looking for a goofy, casual, fanfic like old school JRPG then this game is probably worth checking out, especially if you can get it discounted.\n\nEDIT: After spending a little more time with the game, nothing has changed about what I said above, I will say the music is pretty decent. Not worth the price of admission on its own, but worth bringing up that I did actually enjoy the music. If it's used with royalties or if it's original I don't know.","timestamp_created":1589479159,"timestamp_updated":1591035291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420783966779708862","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/zFuPICcuTbhwI="}
