Knife-wielding character who is a twisted stereotype of obsession. Not a believable character and certainly not one I had any enjoyment reading about.\n\nPositive: Mallek is also a stereotype in a way or two: a hacker stereotype. But it's not played in quite the stereotype way, at least not past the surface level. Mallek is nice to talk to and be around, Mallek is much more hospitable than I ever would have expected from a hacker trope, and he's more \"open\" with you than I'd expect, too.","timestamp_created":1583560905,"timestamp_updated":1583560905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krrl2fACcrbG9gE="}
