Was going to ask for refund, but ill cut em some slack, if they updated the models to something that represents FSX 2018, or even 2008...that may be possible to do on your own via web free dlc cockpits ect, good 1968 Bell 202 model from fsx freeware ect...Yes that helicopter was designed in 60's :) was way ahead of its time, but not represented well in this DLC.  Next time ill do more homework before buying this type of mod, rocketman just a glider for example and useless in freeflight, does show whats possible realtime video wise in FSX, but dont spend more than $6 on it 35% discount not enough :) https://youtu.be/op55fVcVPZI","timestamp_created":1547952825,"timestamp_updated":1547953173,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567269861698150635","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oN7MtOgCdv/guAE="}
