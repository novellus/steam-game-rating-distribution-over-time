    review: 'Pros:

      It''s very funny and enjoyable.

      Unique, funny, and creative characters.

      It''s a quick play. Only about 2.5 hours.

      Played it on PC. Wasn''t too difficult like people say.

      You don''t need a mouse!

      Most of the game is just difficult enough to be goofy, but not enraging or anything,
      which I really liked.

      Even if you mess up a lot, you never die (Well, you do for the story, but that''s
      it) and the narrator says funny things when you do.

      The music is FANTASTIC.


      Cons:

      There are a few points of difficulty or confusion on what to do or which buttons
      to press, but nothing too frustrating.

      I didn''t like some of the crude language. Still, most of it is pretty tame.

      I didn''t like so much of the Satanic stuff, but that wasn''t too heavy either.'
