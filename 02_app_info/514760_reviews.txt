It doesn't support widescreen, there is no map, and the HO scenes are made up of many jumbled objects (although always objects that fit the scene).  There are no achievements, and thus no penalties for using hints when you need them.  Despite what may appear to be a list of negatives, this is a well-constructed game with nice visuals, and I have no hesitation recommending it to those who enjoy HO scenes.  In fact, if you enjoy word lists and more old-style HOPA games, you may enjoy Amber Maiden more than more recent games.\n\n[b]Overall:[/b] An enjoyable game despite the lack of fancy options, collectibles, or map.  It's old-school, but has lots of game play and looks nice enough since there is no attempt to force it into a wide screen setting.  Buy it on sale and relax!\n\nPros:\n- lots of HO scenes\n- a reasonable number of puzzles (mostly easy, a few more challenging)\n- no glitches (running in Windows 10)\n- bonus chapter (short, but adds new HO scenes and locations)\n- basic story that provides a coherent vehicle for a straightforward HO game with nice art and locations\n- music is slightly repetitive, but not bad\n- voice acting is limited but generally decent\n\nCons:\n- no map, no collectibles, no variety in HO scenes (word lists with 2-3 concealed objects)\n- very basic, linear story (but it flowed well, and the various locations fit together)\n- no widescreen\n- resolution for HO scenes is moderate","timestamp_created":1605487963,"timestamp_updated":1605487996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592183470726013184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxtWi5/UCeYPSrgI="}
