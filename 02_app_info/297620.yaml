    review: "Game looks very ugly and wasn't pretty even back in the time when it\
      \ was released. Additionally the optimization is really poor and game often\
      \ hangs for a second or two. It wouldn't be so big issue if there weren't traps\
      \ on every step, trying to kill you. With such technical difficulties you're\
      \ just doomed, accidentally stepping into spikes or jumping over the platform.\
      \ And there are many, many platforms and many, many spikes. Definitely too many\
      \ \u2013 game is designed to irritate you by being unfair.\n\nBut the biggest\
      \ issue is the fact that the last level seems to be broken and the game crashes\
      \ just before the battle with the final boss.\n\nTBH I've bought the game only\
      \ due to the fact that I was playing it as a child\u2026 and I remember that\
      \ it was much more brutal and gory (chopping off enemies' limbs, kicking them,\
      \ tons of blood\u2026). The Steam version does not have even blood. And without\
      \ the whole brutality, there is nothing even a little bit pleasant left in the\
      \ game."
