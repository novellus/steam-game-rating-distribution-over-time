    developer_response: "Just wanted to thank you for being one of the first players\
      \ and reviewers!  I watched your playthrough video and took notes.  I really\
      \ appreciate your review because you are very gracious when your playthrough\
      \ was definitely frustrated.  I'm fixing the bugs right now, I wasn't aware\
      \ the game wouldn't be in full screen, it probably is because you minimized\
      \ and went back to the game, and I didn't accommodate for that.  I'm adding\
      \ the option to switch between full screen in the menu.  Also, I'll work on\
      \ making the player handle better on corners so it's not as easy to get stuck.\
      \  \n\nI had a friend of mine play the game before release and he told me of\
      \ the issue with the camera \"turning\" to the left, and I never had the issue\
      \ myself with my mouse.  This is the first time I've actually seen it myself,\
      \ I'll have to test the game with a different mouse and make sure I have the\
      \ bug fixed.\n\nAgain, thanks a ton for your playthrough and thorough review!\
      \  I'm in the works on a sequel, and I'm doing all the code all from scratch.\
      \  The new one will be much more combat oriented with a variety of enemies and\
      \ hopefully less confusing areas.  This is my first game I've finished and released\
      \ on Steam, so this whole process has been a huge learning experience.  I'm\
      \ grateful for your input (:"

    review: "I haven't done a positive indie horror game review in a while so let's\
      \ do one now. I just finished this game and although it definitely has some\
      \ small issues, it was enjoyable enough that I felt a good review was warranted.\
      \ \n\nSo, let's get the bad out of the way first. The bad also happens to sort\
      \ of be good as well (yeah I know, it's complicated lol). It's the visual style.\
      \ Honestly it's very disorienting and it made my head hurt while playing. However,\
      \ it also adds something really unique to the experience. there are going to\
      \ be people that hate it. There will be people who love it and those that see\
      \ it both ways. I'm in the middle. I think it was necessary to make the kind\
      \ of game they wanted to make but unfortunately, my head was not appreciative\
      \ of the style they chose. \n\nOther than that, there wasn't very much combat\
      \ and I thought originally that combat might have been more of a focus in the\
      \ game. In fact, it's such a very small portion of the game you may as well\
      \ say the game doesn't have combat at all. For the most part, you're going to\
      \ be  looking for keys and solving some small puzzles. Along the way, you can\
      \ discover some secrets and get 1 of (what I believe to be) 2 endings: Good\
      \ and Bad. I received the bad ending on my first playthrough while finding all\
      \ documents and 1 out of 2 secrets in 39 minutes. \n\nThat allows me to touch\
      \ on something else that's slightly disappointing - the length. But, reaching\
      \ back to the art style, if it was much longer I probably wouldn't have been\
      \ able to finish it. So, considering it's roughly $5 for around 40 minutes of\
      \ game time (possibly longer if you explore more and go for both endings) I\
      \ think it's not too bad. To me, price to length is worth it. \n\nI do wish\
      \ you could move this game into full screen. I'm not sure if there's a way to\
      \ go fullscreen or not but I couldn't figure it out. And the mouse kept coming\
      \ out of the game so I had a hard time with the 4 digit keycode puzzle because\
      \ the mouse kept moving out of the screen when I'd try to change the digits\
      \ and confirm. Small issue but it was a little frustrating. \n\nOverall, it's\
      \ a decent game. Price to length ratio is good, the artstyle is weird/unique\
      \ and really works even if it's a bit disorienting, there's plenty of exploration.\
      \ There's a few puzzles and the story is good. I don't want to spoil anything\
      \ but you find notes (20 of them) that explain a little bit about what's going\
      \ on and that helps fill you in on the things you've seen and heard around the\
      \ school. \n\nThis game isn't going to completely blow you away. It's not about\
      \ fighting tons of monsters and lots of blood and gore but it is a neat little\
      \ indie game with a good enough story and a great amount of exploration. If\
      \ any of that sounds good to you, go ahead and give it a shot. If not, maybe\
      \ wait for a sale or pass. \n\nIf you want to see some gameplay (featuring the\
      \ bad ending) check out my video over on Youtube. Just keep in mind that you'll\
      \ probably be spoiling a good portion of the game for yourselves. If it looks\
      \ good shortly after you start watching, I'd recommend not finishing the video\
      \ so that you can enjoy it for yourselves:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_8eBOXKwTc"
