The solo story is set in an absurd universe but is itself quite serious. I think it makes good use of it's unique mechanics, with each faction having a differing set of gimics. I'm happy to call it one of my favorite RTS games. multiplayer is pretty much not there though.","timestamp_created":1587527821,"timestamp_updated":1587527821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ISC0PECdObOggI="}
