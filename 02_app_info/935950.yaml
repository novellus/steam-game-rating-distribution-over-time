    about_the_game: "Grab a mallet and ball, stake the wickets, and enjoy this refreshing\
      \ take on the classic outdoor sport. Shoot, stroke, and knock your way through\
      \ a hand-designed collection of croquet courts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCroquet the\
      \ app is inspired by the sport enjoyed by many people. The rules most closely\
      \ resemble 9-wicket Croquet, however, there are some creative differences including\
      \ the layout of the courts. A game is played by two, three, or four players.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as gameplay goes, the primary rule is that passing\
      \ the ball through a wicket gives you another stroke. There is also the special\
      \ croquet stroke that occurs after striking another ball. The first player to\
      \ pass through all wickets in the course and reach the final peg is the winner.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nTriumphed in the literary imaginations of Lewis Carroll and\
      \ Edward Gorey, the sport has been given notice by authors in the whimsical\
      \ and nonsense tradition. As such, Croquet Pro takes this spirit to heart in\
      \ the design of each unique court. Some courts, like the leading Monk\u2019\
      s Meadow feature a traditional wicket arrangement. Others \u2013 such as the\
      \ eerie Creepy Castle and ultimate Erstwhile Emptiness \u2013 employ asymmetrical\
      \ tendencies for more curious and intriguing gameplay. You gain access to new\
      \ courts by earning stars just through playing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother key\
      \ feature of Croquet is the ability to perform the namesake croquet stroke and\
      \ foot roquet. A croquet is achieved by striking the ball of another player\
      \ in the same court. A successful hit gives you a choice \u2013 you may either\
      \ place your foot on your ball then hit the other ball or continue with an extra\
      \ stroke. It is possible when continuing to strike both balls in a way like\
      \ billiards. Once the action is taken, you must be careful not to strike the\
      \ same ball again before your next turn or you are penalized with returning\
      \ to the same position from which your turn began. Special strokes make the\
      \ game much more compelling and strategic than simply a race through wickets\
      \ to the finish. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCroquet supports offline and online play.\
      \ You may either play against up to four of the computer opponent or go online\
      \ and play against other people. There is a multiplayer lobby with public and\
      \ private game options. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe AI opponent in offline mode\
      \ plays competitively and fairly, and can offer a fun challenge for both beginning\
      \ and experienced players."
