    review: "it save's you time so it's a thumbs up for me. The main con would be\
      \ the documentation is poor but it's just lua and early in development.\n\n\
      I tell you what this is great for is IOT devices like nodeMCU etc this software\
      \ handles the socket side of thing's so you can easily make a dashboard with\
      \ html, css and js \n\nfor this kind of money you can't go wrong tbh"
