It honestly is the worst version of a management/idle game.  The AI seems to be really arbitrary what it selects, no matter your funding or technology level, frequent RNG that sets you back 6-12 turns at a time, the graphics are worst than 2, and just... lacks a lot of love.\n\nI appreciate the AI attempt to reduce the times spent on micro-management, but... it is a seriously failed attempt.","timestamp_created":1609227440,"timestamp_updated":1609227440,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523726403713226318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+MHb1vYCeZavvgI="}
