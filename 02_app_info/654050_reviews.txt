Your all in one, in this cyberpunk shooter.  \n\nJydge is an amazing game.  It is one of my favorites.  You play as the Jydge, a cyborg swat officer designed to handle any situation through the use of cybernetic enhancements and your trusty \"Gavel\".  You can choose from an array of modifications for the Jydge, and multiple firemodes, specials, and mods for the Gavel.  Strategically choose these to complete the objectives of the mission.  The price of failure is death.\n\nThere are four difficulties.  Normal, Hard, Grim, and Nightmare.  Each difficulty not only has harder bad guys, it has slightly different objectives, making it not only a greater challenge, but also fresh game play. \n\nThe game fits nicely into the company's lore for their games.  The graphics are decent, but the soundtrack is great.  Lots of synth punk.  \n \nOverall, Jydge is one of the best games I have played.  Always a challenge, always fun. Shout out to ErikaUnlimited for the wonderful guide she made. If you need help with any of the achievements her guide is the place to go. Give it a thumbs up.\n\nHave fun, and good luck.  You'll need it.\n\nZattmann","timestamp_created":1609534779,"timestamp_updated":1609600974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy7fs4fYCcNPBvwI="}
