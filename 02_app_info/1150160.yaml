    review: "I Love this game.\n\nIt is just as ruthless as Castle Explorer. But here\
      \ it is your own Greed that drives you to the death. \nIt Is a fun game where\
      \ only the hosts need it and all others can join in - Just like jack box games.\
      \ \n\nThe Feeling \"There is 52% chance I will get gold and 4% change I will\
      \ meet the same trap again and die. I NEED GOOOLD\" and then the trap....\n\n\
      Running 5 Games in a row to see what player wins and so is just so fun - Had\
      \ a game here the other day, The AFK Dude that fled on round one all rounds\
      \ got on the 3 places. we were 6 players ;) \nSo even if you don\u2019t make\
      \ any dictions or can\u2019t make yourself to do anything there is still a chance\
      \ for the podium.\n\nthe game is a nice addition to the Castle Explorer series\
      \ and is a good alternative if only you have 30 minutes to play and don\u2019\
      t want to wait on all the other players and so.\n"
