    about_the_game: 'As <i>Street Sweeper</i>, your job is to clean up each randomly
      generated neighborhood before your impossibly short shift is over, in the brief
      window of time when the rest of the city is asleep.  Dead leaves from trees
      removed long ago.  Garbage, so carelessly piled. Even vomit, as big as an oil
      slick.  The Street Sweeper takes it, and is careful not to wreck any city property
      in the process.  The bosses back at the station measure the yield at the end
      of each run, then send the Cleaner of Streets back into the next job.<br><br>This
      game is powered by Unity 3D, with assets developed mainly in Blender, and with
      help from other free programs like Audacity, and Paint dot NET. <br><br>All
      content is a creation of Blue Bananas Productions (BBP).<br><br>If you have
      a PS4 controller: plug that bad boy in!  Other controllers might work as well
      if the Inputs are the same.  Keyboard (WASD) and Mouse compatible.'

      generated arcade experience.
