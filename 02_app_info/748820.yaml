    review: '[h1]No updates since November 2018, don''t buy until you see more activity[/h1]


      Old review:


      [h1]Monstrously good promise[/h1]


      Let''s hope it delivers.


      Game has beautiful models, tight controls and great aesthetics. It really brings
      the dark fantasy Victorian setting to life.


      Controls (the most important part of a brawler imo) are good and tight, I got
      into them in no time. Sadly enemy AI still need to get better.


      Game is far from finished, and I''ve [b]found a bunch of glitches.[/b] Let''s
      hope this game keeps up in the direction it''s going, and doesn''t fall short
      of the big promise the devs are making. If you want a finished game, I''d recommend
      you to wait and see how the game develops.


      [b]I appreciate this running natively on Linux[/b], I really do.'
