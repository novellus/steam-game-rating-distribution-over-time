Has a wonderful artstyle and a cute, innocent sort of attitude like a gameboy RPG. I do find myself wishing it was a little more in-depth, and that there was more you could do with *your* character in specific besides just adding him to the small population of meandering townsfolk. Ultimately, the NPCs come across as little more than set pieces with a few lines, and the game itself feels more like a browser idler game than the cardio-fueled Stardew Valley I was (admittedly unrealistically) kinda' hoping for.\n\nStill adds a fun component to my daily runs, it synced quickly and nicely to the free Strava phone app, and it has a solid sense of progression that promises I'll have to do a *lot* of exercising before I can consider myself having 'beat' it. I really do appreciate it.","timestamp_created":1596165578,"timestamp_updated":1596165578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0bu40fMCctjFmAI="}
