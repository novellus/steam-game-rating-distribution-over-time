    review: "In the initial hour of gameplay, I thought this game was going to blow.\
      \ It was a Greenlight project by one guy. You start with a tutorial of the controls.\
      \ If you are using a keyboard you won\u2019t know what the buttons are unless\
      \ you look at the load window beforehand. Luckily, I went in blind and guessed\
      \ them all because I have no life. You have a basic combo and 4 strong combos\
      \ that also fill a \u201Coverdrive\u201D meter that increases your attack power.\
      \ You can dash, parry that stuns, and have an energy combo for breaking shields.\
      \ That\u2019s it. The controls seem clunky at first, but soon you can pick it\
      \ up and get your hands in the rhythm. \n\nThere are 6 levels, 2 of which are\
      \ solely boss fights. Why he didn\u2019t add in a third to make it balanced,\
      \ I\u2019m not sure but the game is hard enough without a extra boss. The environments\
      \ are a little dull but nice to look at it. There are about 6 enemy types with\
      \ their own way of disposing of them. You can try other ways but I assure you\
      \ that you will die and your options are limited anyway. The story you get at\
      \ the beginning is an evil robot invaded a space station and he wants to do\
      \ some bad stuff to some colonies. You have no name, and as far as I can decipher,\
      \ you\u2019re a robot whose helmet never got painted and you have no visor or\
      \ eyes to speak of so I\u2019m not sure how you can see. But that\u2019s ok!\
      \ It all seems so simple right? \n\nConsider this game to be... a test of endurance\
      \ and dexterity and it suddenly becomes more fun. It is challenging in the sense\
      \ that it expects you to memorize enemy movements to the T. Because if you don\u2019\
      t, you will be punished. Enemies will give you little time to breath, and on\
      \ the hard difficulty you will be kiting and using run and go tactics a lot.\
      \ There are health and 1up drops and that\u2019s all. A simple formula that\
      \ almost antagonizes you mentally when you run out of lives and get a game over\
      \ because of its simplicity. So, you get good. So good that the tougher fights\
      \ have blood rushing to places you didn\u2019t know exist in your body and your\
      \ fingers become so tense you think you have frost bite. \n\nI 100% completed\
      \ this game in four hours, but man it felt like a life time. When I finished\
      \ it, I literally had a genuine sense of accomplishment because I overcame something\
      \ legitimately difficult. For 6.99 you get about 4 hours if you to have no life,\
      \ or a lot of time on your hands. Personally, I bought this discounted for a\
      \ dollar and would recommend picking it up at that price."
