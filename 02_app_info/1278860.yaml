    review: 'The concept of this game is refreshing. It reminds me to the pen&paper/tabletop
      games where I used such dice a lot myself. Instead of an invisible random success/failure
      program I can see the dice rolling. It makes the game slower than some other
      survival games, but it also adds a lot of "flair" which I like.


      The Developer is polite and open for suggestions, and the game is better playable
      than some other Early Access games that I tried to play. I can walk around,
      loot plants, chests and other things for food and crafting. When I go sleeping,
      the game is saved, and after relog, the items are still available (some devs
      of other games failed in that point).


      From my point of view I can recommend this game, but of course there is still
      room for improvement, which is for me fully logical and acceptable in an Early
      Access game. And it gives me the possibility to add my own ideas into development.
      I will definitely keep this game in my library.'
