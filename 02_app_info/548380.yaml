    review: "[b]Please be aware[/b] that in a future update (this review was originally\
      \ posted on October 18th 2019) the Halloween Dungeon Keys (Currently [i]Haunted\
      \ Cemetery Key[/i] in game) will be \"converted to standard Cemetery Keys in\
      \ a future update\" [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/diokpc/heroic_weekend_kiddforcetoastrz_stream_and_more/](Source)].\
      \ According to [url=https://www.realmeye.com/forum/t/heroic-weekend-kiddforce-toastrz-stream-and-more-x-32-0-5/51639]this\
      \ RealmEye thread[/url], the current version is [b]X.32.0.5[/b].\n\nWhen redeemed,\
      \ I received the following items:\n[list]\n[*]Halloween Cemetery Key (x10)\n\
      [*]Pumpkin Head Pet Skin (Soulbound) x1\n[*]Frankensteins Monster Skin x1\n\
      [*]Witch Skin x1\n[/list]\n\nNote that the \"1x Halloween Candy\" was missing\
      \ from my gift chest in the vault. There was literally an \"Empty item slot\"\
      \ where it should have been, but I am almost certain that this was a token for\
      \ Halloween events. However, the Witch Skin and Frankensteins Monster Skin were\
      \ [i]not[/i] soulbound, so you can trade them if you wish. Since the other three\
      \ reviews have been written, the pet skins act like the standard skins in the\
      \ way that you can change your pet's skin or family in the Pet Yard for Fame\
      \ or Gold.\n\nAs for value, decide your purchase on how much you would pay for\
      \ the Frankensteins Monster Skin and Pumpkin Head Pet Skins, as you can purchase\
      \ a Witch Skin for either 285 or 300 Gold in the Nexus depending if it's on\
      \ sale and standard Cemetery Keys cost 50 Gold each (500 Gold total). You can\
      \ probably get the keys for less if there's a Cemetery event and you're willing\
      \ to gamble on a mystery box. \n\nI personally recommend this at the time of\
      \ reviewing because I wanted those two skins and I plan to pop the keys before\
      \ their conversion."
