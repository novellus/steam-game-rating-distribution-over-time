Each level takes around 5-10 minutes (usually closer to 10) and there are 111 of them. So lots of value here that just isn't worth the effort to undertake.\n\nMaybe it's not my kind of game. It is certainly addicting to want to fill in all the squares and see the check marks appear as you finish a color. But the anti-stress part? Yeah, pretty sure I was more stressed while playing. The calming music didn't really help either.","timestamp_created":1598421740,"timestamp_updated":1598421903,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578443348407745361","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46dTXlPQCcJjpnQI="}
