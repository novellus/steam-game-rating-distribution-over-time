It could be a fun little game with some more work.  But it definitely needs a lot of work and love because as it is now, it only scored about a 4 out of 10 from me.\n\nWhat's broken:  \n\nCollisions:  You character will fall down when just walking into any object what-so-ever.  It's quite funny the first few times, but quickly gets frustrating.  Maybe make it so you fall down only if running over an object, but not when walking.  And make the mice never make you fall down because that is just goofy as hell.\n\nFighting:  The fighting is complety broken and just not fun.  All you need to do us spam your left mouse button and hope for the best.  Make the fighting interesting.  Gave the player some way to dodge swings by enemies (besides holding up a shield) and make the player weapon collisions better with enemies.  It just needs work because as it is today it just looks and feels stupid silly.\n\nDoor Buttons:  Way to hard to find and see.  Make the buttons more obvious as they are sometimes just way to hard to find as they blend into the wall too much\n\nFix these issues and give the game a little more TLC and you might have a game I can give a recommended score to.  I'll check back on this one in a few months, especially if I come back and see some updates have been done to fix some of these issues I've described above.\n\nAt launch this game is funny, but it's a mess.  It needs work and I cannot recommend it in its current state.   4 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1540752836,"timestamp_updated":1540759239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588174104690551758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1545059850,"developer_response":"Thanks for attention to our game.
