Boring, Broken, and Borked.. This game is fun, if you enjoy playing a game that is pointless,, in fact this game is more then just pointless, it's a buggy and broken mess..\n\nI gave this game a chance, even after Mc. Shady revoker keys, decided to take a giant flaming dump on people who bought his game via a bundle.. I guess breaking business agreements is what Mr. Shady Dev does best.. Another in a long list of snatch and grabbers< who snatch your money and run with it.... then try to make up excuses and lies to excuse their bad behavior.. but anyway lets get back to the actual game play..\n\nDid I say gameplay, excuse me, the clicking of a button every minute, while you stare at absolutely nothing but a screen with the inability to do much of anything, other then scroll through a bunch of other screens where you can't do anything..\n\nThis game tried to be a clicker game, but it's like a clicker game being played by Grandma Rosie, the 105 year old woman with carpal tunnel, who manages to click a staggering 4 times per minute.. I guess this game might have been fun, if you could manage to stomach playing it for more then a few minutes at a time.\n\nUltimately you'd be better off doing anything else with your money rather then buy this game.. I mean after all, the dev stole enough of our money as it is.. no need to give him more.. The fact steam allows people like this to release broken buggy, almost non games on their service and then sell hundreds of keys to bundle sites, only to revoke them due to the ease with which valve leaves the dev tools open to any Tom ♥♥♥♥ or Harry..\n\nIf you really still want to buy this game have fun throwing your money down a giant hole,, with this type of shady developer don't say I didn't warn you when they eventually release the patch with the keylogger/miner/ or other nerferious software that installs in the background.. If they have zero issues with robbing people, I'm sure they have no issues with releasing garbage hidden software.. buyer beware..\n0 Comments","timestamp_created":1605163281,"timestamp_updated":1605163613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634817659854888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tJ/N3fUCeYjxrQI="}
