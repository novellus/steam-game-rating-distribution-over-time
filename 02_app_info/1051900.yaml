    review: "Veramente felice di dirlo: un gioco italiano con le coffe. Exit Limbo\
      \ - the game, sviluppato dalla Virtual Craft Studio, fornisce tutto quello di\
      \ cui si ha bisogno in un picchiaduro a scorrimento: botte, sangue, botte ed\
      \ esplosioni, e perch\xE8 no anche delle botte. Una modena furry dove impersoniamo\
      \ Mr. Rhino, un rinoceronte che \xE8 incazzato e ci tiene a farlo sapere. Non\
      \ vedo l'ora che escano i prossimi capitoli."
