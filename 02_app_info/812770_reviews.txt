Primarily due to ridiculously low resolution, the like of which I've never seen on any other game on my WMR Samsung Odyssey+.  This is simply not good enough, and worse than your average smartphone VR app, Furthermore the scale is way off on just about everything, except strangely the track.    The cart is far too large, along with most of the artefacts, skeletons etc.  Shame in some ways, as the concept of the ride is not that bad with some nice touches, but the execution is visually extremely poor.  Even at the discounted sale price of 42 pence, cannot recommend this ride.","timestamp_created":1604175606,"timestamp_updated":1604175606,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj6aUwPUCfIiyqwI="}
