No fighting. You evade the monsters and try to find collectable harps while seeking to escape the tower. \nTeleport only. There are checkpoints every floor, but no save points so you have to finish in one sitting. Which is fine bc it took me less than an hour to finish.\nIt's not early access and dev is not responsive in discussion board so don't expect any changes. \nOn the plus side, it runs fine and is inexpensive.","timestamp_created":1529235911,"timestamp_updated":1529235911,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561730146408081055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lYbkhuQCe9abowE="}
