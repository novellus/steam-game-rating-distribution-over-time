It is much more a story than an actual game. The gameplay elements are very shallow so don´t expect much in this regard. I like the art style a lot. The voice actors do a fantastic job.\n\nI think that the regular price is a bit steep for the number of hours you get. [u] So, put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.  [/u]\n\nOverall a very nice game. I purchased it during a sale and don’t regret this decision at all.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1610056033,"timestamp_updated":1610056033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rqy07/YCcqixwQI="}
