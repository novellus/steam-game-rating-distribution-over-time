While There's a guide for the controls and ship designs there's no informations about what am I even suppossed to do in this game. It's probably about fighting with enemies in space, But the balance is a mess. All my ships are ridiculously slow and underpowered but enemies are complete opposite. This happens in the second stage with the lowest difficulty settings. Instead of overly tedious control type tutorials, It need tutorials about the actial gameplays and a serious rebalance.","timestamp_created":1595303033,"timestamp_updated":1595303033,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4io/et/MCdpvMlgI="}
