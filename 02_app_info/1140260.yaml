    review: "Blade Warrior's store page heralds this game as a MS-DOS \u201Cclassic\u201D\
      , a label that it does not [i]truly[/i] deserve. Instead of being a well-remembered\
      \ title, the game was actually very obscure on the PC. It is a port of a better\
      \ known Amiga title that *did* get quite some recognition and a score of positive\
      \ reviews. So, how come the PC-version isn't as well remembered? And how does\
      \ the game hold up in this day and age? Lets find out!\n \nI actually bought\
      \ this game back in the day, so I\u2019ve added some personal memories to this\
      \ review. If you don\u2019t want to read all that, I\u2019ve added a TLDR-section\
      \ at the end. I've also put up [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2207920987]a\
      \ guide[/url] based on my notes.\n \n[b]Days of future past[/b]\nIn 1991, the\
      \ British publisher 'Image Works' was a company I held in high regard. Among\
      \ others, it put out titles like \u201CFirst Samurai\u201C, \u201CSpeedball\u201C\
      \ and \u201CXenon 2: Megablast\u201C. These were legendary to the 14-year old\
      \ me: tightly designed games that didn't cost an arm and a leg, with superb\
      \ graphics and music. Well worth saving up some hard-earned cash for. \u2018\
      Image Works\u2019 was part of a larger company called \u2018Mirror Soft\u2019\
      , headed by the larger-than-life media-magnate Robert Maxwell.\n \nWhen news\
      \ arrived about Image Works\u2019 latest title, I was filled with anticipation:\
      \ the magazine I read wrote a preview about a fantasy-themed game that combined\
      \ hack-and-slash mechanics with elements found in adventure-games. The combination\
      \ seemed interesting. Even more impressive was the game's graphical style: early\
      \ screenshots depicted a game that communicated it's ruined world by presenting\
      \ everything in silhouette, shrouding everything in a perpetual darkness. The\
      \ stark contrast between the shadowy scenery and the moonlit backdrop made a\
      \ big impression. Something clicked. I *had* to have this game.\n \nLike most\
      \ \u2019Image Works\u2019-titles, Blade Warrior was positioned as somewhat of\
      \ a budget-game: it came in a small box featuring cover art from Simon Bisley\
      \ (known from comics like Slaine and ABC Warriors). It contained an A5-sized\
      \ manual, a registration card and a single blue 3.5 inch floppydisk. \nThe game's\
      \ backstory turned out to be highly unoriginal: a once peaceful land has been\
      \ beset by an evil entity called Murk, corrupting everything. You -  the unnamed\
      \ protagonist and titular Blade Warrior - must seek out fragments of an ancient\
      \ tablet to restore the world, slaying foes along the way. I\u2019ll be honest:\
      \ shallow plots didn't really bother me in those days. First and foremost, I\
      \ was looking forward to exploring that dark, well-drawn two-dimensional world.\n\
      \ \n \n[b]A sum of its parts[/b]\nAs mentioned before, Blade Warrior combines\
      \ several types of game-genres and uses several \u2018systems\u2019 to accomplish\
      \ this. Three genres stand out:\n\n[list]\n[*]A side-scrolling brawler, where\
      \ you roam the land and fight enemies with sword & spells.\n[*]An adventure\
      \ game, where you search for items, needed to obtain fragments of a tablet.\n\
      [*]A SHMUP, where you ride a dragon between wizard\u2019s towers, shooting at\
      \ incoming enemies.\n[/list]\n \nWhile the combined genres provide for an entertaining\
      \ and engaging game overall, the implementation of the individual parts feels\
      \ a bit rudimentary at times. The hack-and-slash part, for instance, has a nice\
      \ selection of enemies and different sword-strokes to vanquish them, but it\
      \ doesn\u2019t play as fluidly as, say, [url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/axe-of-rage]Barbarian\
      \ II[/url]. Killing enemies often requires positioning yourself strategically,\
      \ since the different types are  vulnerable to different strokes. A spider,\
      \ for example, is best hit with a low jab. If it descends towards you from a\
      \ hill, you're at a disadvantage. Repositioning yourself or casting a spell\
      \ helps in these situations. Most enemies are generated at random, so walking\
      \ a stretch of road will be different every time you visit it.\n \nThe adventure\
      \ game elements consist solely of item-based puzzles: you roam the lands collecting\
      \ things and trading them for others. There's a basic hierarchy to things: Wizards\
      \ hold the fragments to the tablet you need to defeat Murk. They will trade\
      \ these for artifacts, but each covet different ones. You can trade artifacts\
      \ they hold for other artifacts or (often, but not always) spell-ingredients.\
      \ Wizards also provide spells and advice and clues to \"who wants what\". To\
      \ visit all the wizards and collect all the artifacts, you'll need access to\
      \ the different roads, which are entered through archways. Some of these are\
      \ closed and require keys that can be found on other roads.\n \nCollecting stuff\
      \ is an important element of the game. In my current session, I've collected\
      \ twelve of the fourteen artifacts during a span of ~10 hours of gameplay. I\
      \ have to mention that I spent most of this time walking around to collect ingredients.\
      \ You don't necessarily have to do that: Visiting the wizards (or other places)\
      \ can be made easier with the 'Travelle'-spell or the dragon-rides.\n\nMixing\
      \ spells is intuitive: the ingredients you pick up during your travels belong\
      \ to the four traditional alchemic elements: earth, water, fire and air. A spell-book\
      \ in your tower shows which ingredients to mix to create the different types.\
      \ After mixing them, you can assign them to slots that are used by pressing\
      \ the function keys. An exception is made for harpy-slaying potions, that can\
      \ be found scattered around the landscape and used by pressing [space].\n \n\
      The dragon-ride / SHMUP-section is easily the weakest part of the game. It feels\
      \ the developers added it more as an afterthought, at least on the PC. I also\
      \ own Blade Warrior on the Amiga and on that particular system, this part has\
      \ been fleshed out more properly. The dragon-rides are not really functional\
      \ on either platform though: once you get the 'Travelle'-spell, you can move\
      \ to any desired position far more efficiently.\n \n \n[b]Looking sideways\u2026\
      \ And back[/b]\nIn a forum-post, I reflected on how the PC-version Blade Warrior\
      \ compared to it's Amiga counterpart. Some observations were:\n\n[i]The PC-version\
      \ has:\n[list]\n[*]slight slowdowns when it needs to scroll things in parallax\n\
      [*]animations that are less smooth\n[*]very basic sounds (Amiga also disappoints)\n\
      [*]no changes to the background color palette\n[/list]\n\nIn theory the Amiga-version\
      \ *should* be the better game, based on the points listed earlier. Personally,\
      \ I like the PC-version more.[/i]\n \nThe PC-port has a slightly more sedate\
      \ pace, bringing more focus to the adventuring part. The Amiga-version has more\
      \ emphasis on the brawler-part of the game, where action is more fluid. Since\
      \ it can be quite hard to hit enemies when you're not facing them strategically\
      \ *and* the random encounters allow you to get mobbed from different directions,\
      \ the Amiga-version is more challenging and (to me) less fun.\n \nSo, why didn't\
      \ Blade Warrior attract more attention at the time? I have several theories.\
      \ One is it's start on the Amiga, a system that was less popular in the US compared\
      \ to Europe. Second, during the time Blade Warrior was published, Both Image\
      \ Works and Mirror Image were in a lot of trouble: Robert Maxwell died under\
      \ mysterious circumstances and his business-empire collapsed after cases of\
      \ fraud came to light. All-in all, the game might not have shipped as widely\
      \ as anticipated or promoted as actively as it could have been.\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]\n\
      Okay, so I like the game and think the combination of different genres works\
      \ well, even though they're not extremely impressive when looked at individually.\
      \ If you like obscure games from a long forgotten era, this one is quite engaging.\
      \ A quick summary:\n\nPro's:\n[list]\n[*]Moody graphics that communicate a lot\
      \ of detail even in silhouette\n[*]Interface is quite intuitive\n[*]Collecting\
      \ stuff, trading with wizards etc. takes time but is fun\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n\
      [list]\n[*]Sound is almost non-existent\n[*]It can be quite hard to hit enemies\
      \ at times\n[*]Noticeable slow-downs when parallax scrolling portals animate\n\
