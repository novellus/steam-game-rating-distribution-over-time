Like I gave the game a good several hours of play, and this music is just not vibing. With anything.\n[olist]\n[*] Gang Beast Days: It sounds like they wanted to recreate some sort of whimsical feeling of Molecule Media's 'Little Big Planet.' Worst of all, the main theme song, which includes creepy and untalented children chanting the name of the game, and even spelling it. Which in turn gives it a sudden Mortal Kombat meets Little Big Planet. Why? \n[*] Containers of Joy: I don't think Little Big Planet was a good choice for a game where you can drop living beings, whom I would presume to be somewhat human, into meat grinders, and incinerators. This song is in relation to explosions\n[*] Subway Sly: Oops, you committed a war crime... or a hefty fine in my case, stop jumping in front of trains.\n[*] Wheel 2 Electric Boogaloo: Sounds like its trying to be the CDPR building tumbling down as Cyberpunk2077 is released.\n[*] Chutes Ahoy: Another sound of CDPR's PR crumbling as complaints roll in.\n[*] Cooling Dawn: Decent Chiptune song, no real complaints, reminds me of Sonic's famous snow level, you know the one.\n[*] Gondal Getdown: This song causes a visceral reaction, as the level this song is attuned to, is horrifyingly difficult in a game about physicis based fights and ring outs. Sounds like bubble pop.\n[*] Buoy Beautiful: This one feels like they were making a synthwave Donkey Kong Country Song, like it a lot.\n[*] Fans Forever: Very Rapid upbeat fast pace and happy song, with another synthwave vibe.\n[*] Grind On: Remember She, the EDM artist? This has that LBP chanting with a song that could fit right next to Super Nova.\n[*] \n\n\nTL;DR\nWhy the fuck would you make this? Skip this crap.\nOr don't I don't care outside of my own enjoyment.","timestamp_created":1598052010,"timestamp_updated":1609094667,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r4Ph0vYCfdH2nAI="}
