Upgrading your towers is meaningless due to the fact the boss can fly along and destroy your towers regardless of how strong they are. There is no way to shoot down this particular plane. Enemies come in waves, usually by airdrop, totally bypassing your defenses. Not only that, but all the towers you build can be easily destroyed by the lowliest of baddies with a gun. One would think that by spending the points to upgrade your gun turrets lets say, would make them a force to be reckoned with, but no. Mere cannon fodder. \nThis game is infuriating. Look elsewhere for a good TD game folks.","timestamp_created":1571428257,"timestamp_updated":1571428257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zomb8O0Ccq6p1AE="}
