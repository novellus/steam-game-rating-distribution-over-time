    short_description: Dan is awoken with a start. At first, he thinks it's just Mr.
      Mumbles having a little post-taco indigestion, but that turns out to be wishful
      thinking when Dan's bed, clothes, and even his burrito are all under attack
      by what seems like a monster under the bed.
