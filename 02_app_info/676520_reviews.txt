You can find all the music and ambient tracks as wavesound files in the installation folder.\n\nThe controls are still as awkward as in the first game but not impossible to get used to. You move with the mouse by clicking on directional prompts that appear on the screen.\n\nThe gameplay mostly revolves around traveling and exploration. \nYou are a cat and walk around an area with the girl. Listen to their conversation for instructions, clues and the story. Find certain key items to progress.\nThere are some simple turn based RPG elements but with a little strategy you'll be able to easily dispose of your enemies.\n\nFrom what I can tell the Japanese voice acting is good. The English subtitles not so much but its not complete gibberish. I'd almost say the translation has a certain charm to it.\n\nTo prevent frustration I recommend to frequently save. There will be events happening that might end in a Game Over.\n\nIt ended on quite a cliffhanger but there is definitely a lot of creativity that went into this. \nAnd that is something I can always appreciate.","timestamp_created":1587778978,"timestamp_updated":1594746500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuo6Tp/MCfvWigwI="}
