    review: "[b]Smoothness[/b]\n\nI must say that this runs pretty smoothly on my\
      \ PC and it seems that the devs have really improved stability in the recent\
      \ patches. Turns last no more than about 30-40 seconds for me which is definitely\
      \ good for a game like this.\n\n[b]The setting and features[/b]\n\nThe setting\
      \ is great, the Great Powers have their own goals and agendas, there are tons\
      \ of different units and I love how you are sending expeditions to the colonies\
      \ as units and then using decisions to influence how those develop. The colonization\
      \ is definitely something amazing here.\n\nThe military system is simply amazing\
      \ with enough units to make your head spin. Overall, it is a very good and tested\
      \ system for military matters and it is a much better game than Victoria 2 and\
      \ Hearts of Iron when it comes to military things and the depiction of 19th/\
      \ early 20th century conflicts and WW1. It suits how armies were moved and organized\
      \ back then.\n\nThe setting, however, is not perfect. In 1880 Napoleon was no\
      \ longer the leader of France, and definitely not a president of the Republic,\
      \ \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nGive this game a chance and try it. It works really\
      \ well now and it can certainly be much more fun than Victoria II."
