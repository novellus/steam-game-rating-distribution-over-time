    review: "[i]My Universe - Cooking Star Restaurant[/i] may look visually decent\
      \ (or at the very least inoffensive but dull) and the gameplay maybe be nostalgically\
      \ reminiscent of other games of its type, particularly [i]Cooking Mama[/i],\
      \ but ultimately, you end up with a game with even less depth than the aforementioned\
      \ series that overstays its welcome thrice as fast.\n\nI could forgive the small\
      \ selection of recipes (30 in total, with six recipes each from five different\
      \ countries) if at least some of the steps to make them were unique and specific\
      \ to each of them, but what the preparation of each recipe boils to regardless\
      \ of the actual meal in question are the same half dozen or so minigames, which\
      \ gets repetitive before you even unlock the fourth chef. And none of them are\
      \ even very good, by the way. They tend to fall under \"slightly janky controls\"\
      \ (frying and spreading) or boring (any minigame with randomized button presses\
      \ like egg cracking).\n\nFurthermore, all this padded out by extremely shallow\
      \ restaurant management between cooking sessions. Restaurant level cooking experience,\
      \ sitting and serving customers? No nuance with anything like upgrades and skills\
      \ and the like. They all serve no purpose other than to artificially extend\
      \ the game time and bar you from quickly steamrolling through the recipes one\
      \ by one. Oh, and you're doing all this yourself. These other chefs that are\
      \ teaching you these recipes just stand there and don't do anything on their\
      \ own. You're still doing the cooking for each customer, one by one. And as\
      \ the one cook, I shouldn't have to be playing the roles of manager and server\
      \ as well for an establishment as large as the one being run. Hell, you don't\
      \ even get money. Just experience to progress you closer to unlocking all the\
      \ recipes and reaching the end of the game's \"story,\" which is barely existent.\
      \ \n\nLook, if you're looking for a game that's as simple, relaxing, and leisurely\
      \ paced as the [i]Cooking Mama[/i] series, you can do better. You might as boot\
      \ up your old DS with your copy of [i]Cooking Mama 2[/i] and get your fix that\
      \ way, because [i]Cooking Star Restaurant[/i] doesn't scratch that itch."
