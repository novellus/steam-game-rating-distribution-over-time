    review: 'This game is quite nice somehow, I think it''s okish. If you want some
      disturbing decisions it''s great and I kinda enjoyed it actually, even though
      my mind broke in some decisions... like seriously? What the hell is wrong with
      the Devs to put someone in such situations. Hell no! Still, would buy again,
      wating for Part 2 now.
