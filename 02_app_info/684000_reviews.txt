But on the whole, just from where the product stands as of now, it's not worth the time or the investment.\n\nI played almost 30 hours of this game, and it was well worth it. The game is rather difficult, but strategic, which I thoroughly enjoy. There are lots of interesting and different builds you can try with all of your characters, and different save slots allow you to play through different variants of your characters, giving you a plethora of options in regards to how you can play. That being said, one general frustration is you can ONLY save to that slot that you're currently playing on, and can't backtrack should there be a game breaking bug that you can't get past, which I will be posting up later on today. The good things that this game does, it does well. Ghost Town, variety of different quests, amazing lore, all of that is great.\n\nInversely though, the bad things this game does, it does....really really badly. And they really seem to overshadow the good. Overly excruciating maps with no variety in them. Just long drawn out hallways that span minutes upon minutes of just walking in a straight line. Granted, there are quite a few different areas I felt were really good and had lots of feeling (Lampless, Divine Tower/Forest, Katis, Undead Castle, which is probably my favorite area in the game), but there were others that are just awful. Wooden Road, Pseudo Hell, Underground Mines, and Frozen Cavern came to mind as my least favorite maps. Maps are very very dark, which is intentional and I get it. But there's a thin line between being immersive and being a detriment to the player. Infinite Hotel is the worst offender of both the above. It's literally a 500 x 500 map with nothing but rooms in long hallways.\n\nAnd lastly, the thing that aggravates me the most is the massive amount of times I saw \"Future Content\" in the game. This should have been shipped with the game the first time, and instead we are being dripfed new content like a bad live service game. This is the sort of tactic I would expect from a AAA developer to spoonfeed future content down the line, but indie RPG Maker developers should have everything they need right out of the gate. Patches for glitches and bug fixes obviously can come later on down the line.\n\nThat being said, this really is a good game, but for the asking price and how little actual \"content\" there is right next to all the spots that say \"Future Content\" is really bewildering. Bugs and glitches are rampant in this game, some of them inconsistent. One of my friends who streamed the game was able to start a Quest just fine but I am not able to start it because my characters just keep walking in a straight line. Going outside of the Red Temple after meeting [spoiler]The Symphony of Carbon[/spoiler] forces you to rewatch the scene when you enter the Red Temple again, and then softlocks your game. And not to mention the crashes. THE CRASHES ARE THE WORST. There is no excuse to have your game randomly crash at all, even by just going into a menu and having it crash. Even by just going into a battle and having it crash. And with no prompt, no error message. Just boom, crash, done. It's extremely aggravating.\n\nIf these ever get patched or fixed, I would be willing to change my stance on the game, but again, this game is not worth the asking price right at this moment.","timestamp_created":1598839041,"timestamp_updated":1598839041,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1604273296,"developer_response":"Thank you human! Your review was most murda. Stability shall be focused upon, as will the side areas of future! \n\nThere is a leak of memories somewhere.... but I lack the ability to stop the leaking. Hmmmmmmm....
