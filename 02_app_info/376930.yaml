    review: I'm trying to like this engine and its train. The sound quality is very
      good except for the horn which is the equivalent of someone having a genteel
      little cough into a hankie. There are distinct deficiencies forby the horn,
      however, and it is those that spoil the game for me. Some of the issues have
      already been mentioned by other players and I won't repeat them here. But I
      must mention the one, most important impediment for me - the brakes! For the
      good part of a year I've been trying to master stopping this train safely and
      efficiently but just can't get the hang of it. I spend so much time fiddling
      about with the sensitive/ awkward braking system whilst approaching a station,
      trying to get it right, that I'm distracted from the actual stopping! So I either
      inadvertently put it into emergency braking mode or I'm overcautious when trying
      to avoid the emergency brake demon, that I stop short of the full station platform,
      and then have to start the beastie moving again, or I stop before I even get
      to the platform. I just can't get it right. The problem for me is that the emergency
      setting is too easy to slip into. That makes it undriveable for me. Pity!
