    review: 'Story: Priel Aylin is a Dragonkin mercenary who often finds herself working
      alone, but ends up fighting alongside her estranged sister Perrine for the sake
      of a tag tournament. After winning, they discover that their opponents are actually
      criminals and that their old chuuni friend, Fate, is working with them for his
      own purposes. This conflict eventually forces the sisters to confront their
      grim past in Icefall, their strained relationship, and their outlook on life.


      For those that played the original free version from RPGMaker.net, there''s
      some new dungeons and story segments between the old ones, as well as a True
      Ending if you complete all the sidequests, which leads into future entries in
      the Sacred Earth series.


      Gameplay:


      The game uses a non-ATB turned-based system, with LP, EX, and EP as your main
      resources. You can''t use items to quickly restore any of these resources, but
      the game is balanced so that you can sustain yourself with support skills, EX
      Heal, Focus (basically a guard command with slight recovery), and post-battle
      recovery. The chain attack system could be difficult to use efficiently if your
      reflexes are poor, but once you memorize the keys you need to press, it''s still
      possible to pull off normal chain -> EX -> Limit. I personally find the window
      of opportunity for inputs to be slightly too small, so I usually cut the normal
      attack chain short if it means guaranteeing an EX at the end. Of course, you
      don''t need to do the normal chain, since you''re allowed to use an EX skill
      from the battle menu, meaning you still have a chance to win even if you have
      the reflexes of a snail.


      For the battle UI, it''s impossible to see the enemies'' current buffs and debuffs,
      which can be annoying if the player mistakenly tries to apply a debuff that
      the enemy already has. Additionally, a lot of complaints about OHKOs and RNG
      would be mitigated if the player could see all active enemy buffs, since their
      offensive buffs are most likely causing them to kill everything.


      For those worried about the difficulty, the game is balanced to be a bit on
      the hardcore side. You will need to pay attention to enemy weaknesses and utilize
      offensive buffs, even in normal battles, so that you can make every attack count
      as much as possible. Against tankier enemies and bosses, you''ll need to use
      more defensive tactics to survive a prolonged battle against them, since their
      damage output is rather high. Try to have at least one character defending per
      turn, especially if that character is unable to target the boss''s elemental
      weakness. YMMV may vary on this defensive gameplay, since some like that enemies
      can''t be cheesed with offensive skill spam while others feel that this gameplay
      balance causes battles to be dragged out.


      The dungeons feature a node system, where you can interact with combat, treasure,
      trap, event, and bonus nodes to unlock more of the map. There are also mini-dungeon
      nodes that take you to a tradtional map with enemies and puzzles. While the
      node system makes it convenient to avoid backtracking, the traditional maps
      are more aesthetically pleasing than a static background image. I personally
      would have preferred fewer nodes, but with mostly mini-dungeons so that there''s
      still a clear sense of permanent progression while being able to see what the
      dungeon actually looks like.


      EXP gain is dependent on character level, which means stronger characters get
      less EXP while weaker characters get more EXP. This makes it easy to get the
      party evenly leveled, though it does make later encounters not worth the effort
      except on Nightmare mode. Unfortunately, it''s easy to become too high-leveled
      before even taking out half the enemies in a dungeon, so speedrunners will have
      to keep a balance between fighting and spending TP to skip enemies. I''m willing
      to bet on Normal mode at least that even if you try to skip as much as you can,
      you''ll probably level up enough just from whatever you can''t skip.


      Update: It might be possible to get EXP from skipping enemies. I saw someone
      actually get EXP in their gameplay video despite skipping.


      There''s an equipment system, but it doesn''t involve standard weapons and armor.
      Instead, each character can equip ether gems, which change their stats and elemental
      resistances, thus allowing for more customizability than a traditional equipment
      system. I generally went for balanced stat builds, with a slight bias for whatever
      offensive stat the characters are good at. Once you learn EX Limits, you can
      try going for glass cannon builds in an attempt to annihilate bosses in a few
      turns, though that could be riskier on Nightmare.


      The game makes it fairly easy to find sidequests in town by giving the NPCs
      smiley face markers if they have one. Most sidequests need their criteria completed
      before fighting the current dungeon boss, but you usually can''t report to the
      clients until after the boss, which can make it a bit nerve-wracking to confirm
      if you''ve actually completed it. I''m basically screaming "MIR, WHY WON''T
      YOU TAKE MY FROST QUARTZ?! WHY DON''T YOU LOVE ME?!" until she finally takes
      the quartz in the ending.'
