    review: "Spoilers by the way. This game isn't bad for an rpg, I quite like it,\
      \ but is ultimately a let down. \n\nThe lack of character interaction and story\
      \ are disappointing. When you get to the end, you lose a character but you really\
      \ don't, which makes it pointless. The ending is so, damn, lazy, you just see\
      \ all of the characters in places you've been before. I honestly would've taken\
      \ a romantic ending over that lazy ending, and that's saying something, it's\
      \ so sudden and has no conclusion, and unless there will be some sort of sequel,\
      \ then there should have been more to it. Like I said before, characters don't\
      \ crack jokes, they don't relax ever, they barely ever talk together at all\
      \ unless they're all arguing. They don't ever seem to become friends, they just\
      \ seem like they're tired of each others faces.\n\nI do like this game, but\
      \ cannot recommend it for multiple reasons, because even the fighting is messed\
      \ up.\nWhen you get to the desert or desert temple get ready to be fucked up\
      \ and told you have to get some level ups because god forbid you get in a fight\
      \ with 2 of more enemies with Ancient Curse because if you do you'll probably\
      \ be killed by them spamming it and making you fall asleep and giving you every\
      \ negative status effect (besides a couple of course) so you die even faster.\n\
      I cannot explain enough how poorly thought out that was."
