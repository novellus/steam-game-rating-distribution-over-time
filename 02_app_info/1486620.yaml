    about_the_game: Live Inc. is a cooperative multiplayer (2vs2) game set in the
      80s where one team acts as infiltrators breaking into an office building at
      night owned by the evil corporation named Live Inc. to collect evidence that
      can be used to incriminate the company, while the other team takes on the role
      of Live Inc.'s security and tries to catch the infiltrators.<br><br>On each
      team there is one member navigating through the map in first person towards
      their objective, these are the spy and the security guard. The other team members
      are the hacker and the security system admin who act as overseers in a remote
      location, their goal is to guide their partner towards their objective using
