Or you can spend forever trying to get money to unlock the three extra characters. With a game built around online play, there aren't enough players to find a game regularly, except MAYBE on certain peak hours/days. You can play against ghosts of online players that somehow behave like the real players, so as long as you have some internet access, you can always play a game against bots, but without it, there's only offline couch co-op/Lan - I don't think there is offline bot play. These problems make it tough to recommend spending money on this game unless you get it on sale.\n\nOh, and it's one of those microtransactiony games, where you don't earn much out of standard play. The good news is that the highest cost currency bundle costs about $20, which I think will be enough to unlock the remaining characters and some loot boxes for skins and such, but i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't unlock everything. \n\nDiscJam is worth a purchase on sale, especially at less than $4. But the lack of players, near online-only requirement, and MTX model makes it tough to recommend @ full price.","timestamp_created":1609322126,"timestamp_updated":1609421647,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ya3A3PYCeLrdvgI="}
