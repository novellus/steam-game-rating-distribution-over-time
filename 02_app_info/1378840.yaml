    review: Very little content so far. As someone who really wants language learning
      in vr to get more popular I'm not mad at my purchase. Rather I hope the game
      gets developed more. Maybe add a multiplayer where we can talk to each other
      while messing around with the items? As it stands right now though its not even
      as good as vr vhat. Also the slow pronunciation of the words while picking up
      the objects was kind of annoying. Maybe have a menu where u can choose the speed?
      I hope this game gets better and will be rooting from the sidelines.
