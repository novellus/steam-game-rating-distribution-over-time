    about_the_game: 'SuperCluster: Void is a space adventure RPG. You can explore
      a massive randomly generated galaxy, Interact with alien factions, Battle massive
      enemy fleets and even take command of a fleet yourself. Resources can be collected
      throughout the galaxy to upgrade your ship and its abilities. The story is lighthearted
      yet dark, filled with plenty of lovable characters and genocide. There are also
      many secrets in the galaxy of SuperCluster: Void, all waiting to be uncovered
      by one valiant adventurer who has nothing left to lose. Fight for your people,
      explore the galaxy, and fulfill your destiny, in SuperCluster: Void.<br><br><strong>Quests
      and Exploration</strong><br>SuperCluster: Void allows you to explore your own
      randomly generated galaxy. There are hundreds of different solar systems for
      you to explore with their own planets and moons which can be explored to complete
      quests or gather resources to upgrade your ship. Some of these planets are common
      and contain common resources such as copper or steel. Others are rare and contain
      valuable resources such as diamond or uranium.<br><br><strong>Resources and
      Crafting</strong><br>Resources you collect can be used to upgrade different
      parts for your ship or buy a new ship entirely. You can craft weapons, armor,
      thrusters, and many other upgrades for your ship.<br><br><strong>Combat and
      Abilities</strong><br>SuperCluster: Void has many unique alien factions to interact
      with. Some of these factions will be hostile and attack you while others will
      work with you and assist you on your quest. Your primary weapon is your ship''s
      guns. These have infinite ammunition and a high rate of fire but relatively
      low damage.<br>Your ship has a limited number of missiles as new missiles must
      be crafted from resources you have collected. These missiles have high damage
      and seek out enemy ships. Finally, your ship has certain upgradable abilities.
      These abilities are very powerful but have long cooldowns.  A few of these abilities
      include Radial Burst, Quick Regen, and Rapid Fire. These abilities can be bought
      and upgraded through the use of &quot;Science&quot; which can be collected by
      completing quests and leveling up.<br><br><strong>Commanding your Fleet</strong><br>SuperCluster:
      Void allows you to command your own fleet of starships. Adding a ship to your
      fleet will cause it to follow you around wherever you go and fight with you.
      You can upgrade these ships to increase their shield, hull, and damage or rename
      the ships in your fleet to whatever you want.'

    review: 'Used to play Starflight (yea, the 30 year old space simulation) and trying
      to play this one


      It lacks a decent tutorial and I''m at the moment building a fleet - found out
      when you build a ship it appears inside a shipyard


      Now need find out how to arm and fire missiles >_<


      5/10, will change when it gets better'
