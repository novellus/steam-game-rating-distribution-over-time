    about_the_game: "This is a workout plus memorization game, where the player must\
      \ punch the pads, in the correct order that each combination is called out,\
      \ over 3 rounds. At the end of the workout your score will be added to the leaderboard.\
      \ The faster you throw correct combinations and the more punches you throw in\
      \ total, the higher your score will be. You will need to memorize the combinations\
      \ called out and throw them as fast as you can in the correct order.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nYou will receive points for each punch, based on how quickly that\
      \ punch was thrown. If you complete the combination correctly, you will receive\
      \ bonus points based on how many punches there were. If you get a punch wrong,\
      \ then you will not gain any bonus points for that combination. If you successively\
      \ get combinations correct, then the combo number will go up and if you get\
      \ one wrong, then the combo number will go down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are\
      \ 4 available modes, of which are the original 'Combo Punch Mode', the 'Punch\
      \ Dodge Mode', a new 'Coach Mode' and the 'Heavy Bag Mode'. The original mode\
      \ involves memorizing long combinations and using all of the 8 pads. On the\
      \ other hand, the second mode involves only memorizing 2 to 3 punch combinations,\
      \ of which are shown at a much faster pace and without the voice calling them\
      \ out. It involves an additional swinging arm, you will have to either duck\
      \ underneath, or move back away from. If you get hit by the arm, then you will\
      \ lose 50 points. The new 'Coach Mode' involves a boxing coach character, who\
      \ will show you the combination beforehand. You will receive points for every\
      \ completed combo and lose points for every mistake. The 'Heavy Bag Mode' doesn't\
      \ involve a score and you can take as much time as you want, to do the combinations.\
      \ When a number is called out, throw a combination of that many punches.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are using the standard HTC Vive controllers, then try\
      \ holding them sideways, so that you can throw punches more comfortably. You\
      \ can alternatively use boxing bag gloves, with trackers attached to the top\
      \ of the wrists. If you do this then make sure the tracker is firmly attached\
      \ and that it doesn't wobble. If it wobbles then this will result in the virtual\
      \ glove also wobbling the same amount, so keeping it as rigid and stable as\
      \ possible is important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you first start the game put\
      \ your hands inside the virtual gloves, in the position you want them to be.\
      \ The calibration will start and then the gloves will be locked in place. Also\
      \ before starting the game, use the height adjuster to raise or lower the pad\
      \ stand. You want the top row of pads to be the same height as your head.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to play music via the in game music player, then\
      \ after the game has ran once, a file named 'MusicDirectory.txt' will be created\
      \ in the game's root folder. Enter your music folder's directory path here and\
      \ the game will then load the mp3 files located in this folder.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nYou can record a video like the one shown in the trailer, by activating\
      \ the third person cam inside the game."

    review: Great game.  I love the mitt workouts the most.  At first I was hesitant
      on getting this based on some of the negative reviews about it not working with
      Oculus.  So i took the plunge and bought it and it works perfectly on my Oculus
      Quest.
