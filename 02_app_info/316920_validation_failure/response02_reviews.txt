New maps are intermediate to hard in difficulty but quite challenging for RwR newcomers. \n\nSpecial love to the beach map. Fun driving it pedal to the metal really fast with that  sports car that mimicks a lot that certain stallion car Sonny drove in Miami Vice. And oh, dont get your hopes up too much about the beach map - it is definitely a novelty map as it's straight as a beach can be. \n\nAnd what about price? always right. Full price or (often) discounted - make your pick.","timestamp_created":1426357710,"timestamp_updated":1426357757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619955658912658691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xITjjMwCfa3lOA=="}
