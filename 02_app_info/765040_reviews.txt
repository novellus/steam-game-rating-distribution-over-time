Tower placement and the timing of that placement can be very important. The increase in level difficulty has a nice sense of progression.\n\nThere are a number of maps where you can make limited map changes, and is a great feature. In-game achievements (for various awards) gives extra life to already completed levels.\nThe developers have shown themselves very responsive to queries.\n\nOverall one of my best Tower Defence experiences. \n\n\nP.S. Particularly like the background music (never thought I would put that in a review) - reminds me of my Leo Kottke days!","timestamp_created":1540632622,"timestamp_updated":1556962119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41ZGLweoCfPy1rQE="}
