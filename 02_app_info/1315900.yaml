      \ plot, the character wakes up in an incomprehensible place and gradually remembers\
      \ what happened, while building his assumptions about where he got into.<br\
      \ />\r\nIn a user game, the player sets the level of complexity and can set,\
      \ or use the ready-made seed for generation. The complexity of the levels of\
      \ the user game can be much higher than the plot levels."

    review: I have played just 11 minutes of this game thus far and I am quite impressed.
      I like puzzle games and this is certainly a puzzle. For just 79p it is a bargain.
      Yes, it is repetitive, but so are traditional mazes.  If you like to do a maze
      and want a new challenge then this is the game for you.  If you are not into
      puzzle games then look elsewhere!
