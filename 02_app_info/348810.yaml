    review: "they are saying 2018 it came out BS   I have 75 hours and that was some\
      \ 2 years ago when said was in early development. was not touched  at all for\
      \ those 2 years except for few news /PR's saying they were looking at DLC's\
      \ you buy or pay for online time  to play also . after that and no further upgrades\
      \ being done I got sucked into buying a game that never got finished or bugs\
      \ worked out. It had great potential . but every scene battle is the same .\
      \ boring boring boring . \nlies lies lies so I say stay away from this game\
      \ as reminds me of those traveling faith healers more you put in the hat the\
      \ better you feel all the way up till they leave town. \nthis is them  do not\
      \ buy unless you want a bunch of false promises"
