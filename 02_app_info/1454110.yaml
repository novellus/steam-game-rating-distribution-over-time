    review: "Desolation: End Of Days tries to combine a  beat-em-up game and a zombie\
      \ game together.  While the concept is good, the game is not.\n\nSTORY:\nThere\
      \ is a zombie apocalypse happening.  You are a survivor.  That's it.  There's\
      \ no plot to this game.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDesolation is a brawler game.  It is similar\
      \ to Final Fight, Streets Of Rage, and Rival Turf.  The difference is that you're\
      \ beating up zombies instead of gangs of street thugs.  You will punch, kick,\
      \ and jump kick the zombies.  After killing a zombie, you will get some resources.\
      \  They are food, wood, metal, and tools.  When you get enough items, you can\
      \ purchase upgrades to other areas.  Doing this will unlock different characters\
      \ for you to use.  \n\nPROS:\nDesolation is a simple, beat-em-up game.\n\nCONS:\
      \ \nYou will go through the same stage over, and over, and over, and over again.\
      \  Even if you were to unlock different characters, it doesn't matter.  You\
      \ will fight the same zombies in front of the same buildings without any change\
      \ to the game.  I managed to fully upgrade the farm, and one area to the depot.\
      \  There were still no changes.  I was at least hoping to see a farmhouse, rows\
      \ of corn, or a train in the background.  \n\nOVERALL:\nYou can play Desolation:\
      \ End Of Days for five minutes, and get an overall feel of the game.  I put\
      \ 90 minutes into it, and that was only to fully upgrade the farm.  It's like\
      \ the developers got one stage completed and said, \"We're done.  Let's get\
      \ beer now.\"  I initially enjoyed beating up zombies on the streets.  But we\
      \ need more than that.  Would it have been difficult to give us a nightclub,\
      \ a hospital, or a subway tunnel?"
