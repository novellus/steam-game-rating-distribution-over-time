      \ to guzzle delicious brain matter? Ever wanted to cause complete carnage, terrorise\
      \ the living, control the undead or even form a zombie chicken conga? Well,\
      \ in Brain Guzzler you get to chow down in 'Chow Town'. Be prepared to get addicted\
      \ to this skill based undead fest!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the start of each level\
      \ you change from human to zombie and suddenly develop an insatiable appetite\
      \ to guzzle all other humans (and animals). The game works similar to the 70\u2019\
      s classic Snake and is just as addictive! The more humans you guzzle, the longer\
      \ you\u2019re chain of Zombies becomes. Use your chain of undead to wreak havoc\
      \ over three towns, Brainington, Guzzleford and Guzzleborough smashing through\
      \ military defences and guzzling every brain in sight...the zombie apocalypse\
      \ has never been so much fun!"
