It truly scratches that itch for a vegetable themed rocket league. At first I tought the other reviews might have been posted by the dev's family, but the character's background is indeed very well developed and engaging. The matchmaking seems on point, too bad I could not really test it, since there was no other vegetables to play with :'(\n10/10 would try tossing that salad again.\nLast but nost least, that Major League Carrot logo is a true beauty. Can I use it for my twitch channel ?\n\n- Carotte Mendoza","timestamp_created":1545528575,"timestamp_updated":1545528575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wdCr7OcCf5qItgE="}
