    review: "Ce add-on s'installe et fonctionne apparemment bien. J'ai cependant un\
      \ probl\xE8me avec pro-atc/x et sa moving map. Quand je place un avion sur une\
      \ porte pr\xE9cise dans LLBG, la moving map de pro-atc/x localise l'avion \"\
      \xE0 c\xF4t\xE9\" avec ce qui semble un d\xE9calage fixe (comme un shit de coordonn\xE9\
      es qui d\xE9cale l'ensemble des points de l'a\xE9roport, y compris les pistes).\
      \ Le support FSAddon ne semble pas fonctionner (impossible de s'enregistrer\
      \ sur leur forum), je pense que je vais demander le remboursement de cet addon\
      \ et \xE0 l'avenir \xE9viter FSAddon."
