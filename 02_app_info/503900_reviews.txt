But it's still not a fun game.  It's not even a good Fruit Ninja clone (which is what I was hoping for).  I wanted to like this game.  It's just bad though, even at the sale price of .99 cents.  \n\nIn case you're wondering, if you start game from Steam directly, it will work on Oculus.  However, if you start game directly from Steam VR, it will start upside down.  \n\nWhen the game did work, the fruit/candy would come at me very slow, like slow motion.  No challenge in cutting them up with candy canes.  On top of that, there were hit detection issues.  Randomly, I would hit the fruit right down the middle with my candy cane and nothing would register.  This happened randomly about 10-20% of the time.  \n\nRating 2/10.  Good visuals, nice VR environment, but terrible gameplay, not even a good clone :(  I can't recommend this game free or at .99 cents until it is fixed","timestamp_created":1512021242,"timestamp_updated":1512021242,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562584102153778076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiabfheACcJzgkAE="}
