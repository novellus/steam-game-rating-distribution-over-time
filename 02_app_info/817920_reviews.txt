It’s very interesting and a good look into the mind of the game’s creator Wallace Lovecraft. The core loop of the game is to explore an area, then do a boss fight, then watch a cool cut scene. You’ll meet an interesting cast of characters with some funny quirks, that feel true to real people.\n\nGrinding for Exp seems pretty optional if you have a good grasp of rpg mechanics, but I found myself grinding some random encounters while looking for secrets. The secret areas had additional cutscenes, definitely worth seeking out. \n\nIn the early game I found myself equipping my characters for physical attacks since MP is limited and spells have long cool downs. But as you level up and get more spells, and thus magic attack based loadouts are more viable. But I still felt like I would waste turns having to use a weak physical attack well waiting out some cooldowns. In the late game you are basically forced to use magic attacks.\n\nThe final aera felt like a bit of a slogg, just walking through a long maze and repeating the same fight over and over. There was a patch to make that part a bit easier, but the maze is still quite a bit long. Story wise it makes sense, you’re in a dangerous place and it’s probably not supposed to be fun. But once you’re past it, it’s onto good times and a great ending.\n\nIn a world of games made by committee, NO LOVE stands out as a game by one person, and their thoughts on the world.   \n","timestamp_created":1577157709,"timestamp_updated":1577157709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630901992321014404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zJn7mu8CdMrD5gE="}
