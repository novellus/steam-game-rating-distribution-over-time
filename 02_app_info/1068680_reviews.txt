It's a rollercoaster of emotions with lighthearted conversations along the way. MANY MANY MANY hidden secrets! Talk to everything you can!! Note, decisions are permanent so for optimal gameplay make multiple save files!\n\nLots of deep topics that we should all be aware of and considering in our daily lives and things we easily forget that this game reminds us of. Many cathartic moments for those of us who grew up in adversity but also the satisfaction of completing the game and showing those who doubted you that you could finish what you set your mind to! Very self-empowering and definitely recommend multiple playthroughs for when you miss anything! \n\nBig shoutout to the game creator who exposed his life to the public through this irl experience-inspired game but it's a huge reminder to us all that our experiences are unique but we all share similar end-products to those experiences. Highly recommended!","timestamp_created":1596935981,"timestamp_updated":1596935981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551282048225402832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/Kiz6PMCc5immgI="}
