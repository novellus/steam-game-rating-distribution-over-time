I'm not a god of platformers by any means, but the platforming distance shifted with jumps so the character herself was one of the most difficult to control I've ever played with. In terms of concept, I think the game is awesome and I would recommend it on that basis, but in terms of controls - it leaves something to be desired.","timestamp_created":1577551363,"timestamp_updated":1577551363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u+/Ypu8Cc6rm5wE="}
