    review: First I want to thank you for taking an interest in VR games and being
      a VR developer. That said, if I hadn't gotten this for $1 on sale I would be
      asking for a refund. This should be in early access still because not only does
      the core gameplay need a lot of work, there are a few bugs as well. I gave it
      a half hour of playtime hoping to see it through til the end, but after the
      boss on wave 21 I saw that it kept going I really just didn't feel like playing
      anymore. The wave 21 boss was actually the best part of the game but other than
      that it was boring. The bugs I encountered were waves wouldn't start and enemies
      wouldn't spawn when the fire button was held. This means I had to stop firing
      and wait for the wave to register, then pick up again. It broke the flow of
      gameplay but wouldn't be sun a big deal if it were the only issue. The other
      bug is that when you start firing the first shot goes in the direction that
      the ship is facing, and then the ship turns to continue firing. This is a problem
      most with slow firing weapons like the bomb, where it fires the first shot out
      into space, then I'm waiting aiming at the enemy for the next shot to fire.
      This can be corrected by quickly rotating the ship before shots are fired, but
      it's just some of the work this game needs that I would expect from an early
      access game. I saw that you ported this into VR, so I tried the desktop version
      before writing this review and the controls on that were so horrible that I
      couldn't play for more than a minute. How can you mess up a twin stick shooter?
      Use WASD for movement and mouse for aim, not W for forwards S for back, and
      A and D to rotate. I am sorry for the harsh review but there is potential here
      it just needs more work, and I will happily change my recommendation and review
      if you continue development.
