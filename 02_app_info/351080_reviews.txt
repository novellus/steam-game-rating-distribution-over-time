Eventually competing companies try to acquire your regions and you theirs, and research plays a factor in product superiority.  I like the tension created by reallocating salespeople to take over areas.  Then there are cards to play which aren't immediately accessible until requisite resources from certain regions are built up.\n\nI bought this on sale for about $5.  No disappointment here!  Even without having read the manual, there are gameplay elements that are enjoyable and the basic premise has a great hook.  I can see continuing to play this for a while.  Yes of course the game could use improved graphics - but the gameplay is enjoyable and has a nice level of tension.  Recommended, though because the graphics are such crap and you might have some doubts whether the game is a keeper, wait for the sale price.  If you like economic sims already, it might be worth full price and hope for a refund if you don't get hooked within the first hour of playing.\n\n- Game has bugs.  For example when winning an NDA lawsuit, getting a settlement larger than I think any company could have available  (2 orders of magnitude over).  Either this is a bug or the AI cheats very badly.","timestamp_created":1543100241,"timestamp_updated":1607144287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456330478191375732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sfXQmPYCdZzZsgE="}
