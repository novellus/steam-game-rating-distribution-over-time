The ammo count may look low, but place your shots carefully, and you'll be fine. The 37mm is a peach. Get in close and route one shot right down sweet Jerry's pooper, and it's flight over. The flight dynamics are very similar to the 7B but feels a bit heavier, while faster with a solid dive. The visibility is similar to the 1B with a slight reduction in low 10 - 2 o'clock visibility due to the set back cockpit. You get a vertical speed indicator in the cockpit which is nice, but hard to remember it's there after not having it in the other Yaks.\n\nAll in all, this is a good plane and I'm anxious to get some more hours in it.","timestamp_created":1603247128,"timestamp_updated":1603247128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Le+pPUCc4+VqQI="}
