      /><br><br><i>(Mixed reality footage courtesy HTC, taken at <strong>E3</strong>,
      2016)</i><br><br><strong>Inbound </strong>brings the fast-play action of missile
      defense arcade games of the 80's into the modern era! You are a defense commander
      on FOUR distant asteroid colonies, tasked with protecting the mines from saboteur
      competitors. You tower above the colony in VR, carefully timing volleys of phaser
      fire to destroy the inbound projectiles, as well as defending against ground
      assaults from lumbering mechs and attacking hordes of enemy spacecraft! When
      things get too crazy, use the time distortion button to slow things down. But
      use it wisely...you have a limited supply! A steady aim, quick reflexes, and
      keeping cool under pressure are all critical if you want to survive the onslaught.
      Inbound is non-stop, 2-handed arcade action in a beautifully immersive VR landscape
      that will truly make you feel you've been to other worlds.<br><br><strong>Inbound</strong>
      is arcade-style action...if you like games such as (the excellent) Space Pirate
      Trainer, chances are you will really enjoy Inbound as well! Grab some friends
      and compete for high scores on the four included worlds!

    review: Inbound is EXACTLY the type of game I wanted in my VR library.  If you
      want multiple genres of games, this is a MUST HAVE for general arcade fun.  The
      graphics and atmosphere are well done, you feel like a giant protecting the
      colonies below and around you.  The game starts at a good difficulty level of
      play that progresses quickly, but smoothly. Before you know it, you'll be swinging
      those plasma balls and shooting bombs like crazy! This is a FUN game,  Its a
      very well done VR adaptation of a game from my childhood, Missile Command.  Of
      the many ways this could be accomplished, the Devs put you right in the middle
      of the action!  The incoming mechs and scanners add to the difficulty and variety
      of enemies. The flying mechs in later missions are huge and beautifully textured
      and they glide by. it was hard to blow it as I was admiring the modeling!  Inbound
      puts you right in the middle of some intense ARCADE action that doesnt cost
      a pocket full of quarters to enjoy.    Well Recommended
