    short_description: After adding more refinements to our handle we copy our low
      poly model and start working on the high poly version. We look at the difference
      between chamfer modifier and the OpenSubdiv modifier which we use in this tutorial.
      You can also use the chamfer modifier instead if you prefer that.
