So it's pretty much nothing like being blind. The \"gameplay\" consists of staring at white text on a black background and slowly moving around a room using WASD, which in itself feels pretty uninspired and lazy. Overall, the \"game\" fails to actually be a game and feels more like you're doing nothing. I wouldn't even rebuy this game if it was free.","timestamp_created":1595397935,"timestamp_updated":1595398063,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5539742112159729","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4udDIuvMCeffrlgI="}
