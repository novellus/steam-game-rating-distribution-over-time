As she peers deeper into the century old mystery, Mei will be forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyperpunk dystopia, the ruins of the 'Chong Sing Apartments' hides a bloody mystery illuminated by both the traditions of Chinese folklore and the innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei-Lin must explore this complex, piecing together the stories of 14 lost souls, and discover the truth of her own family curse. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1129060\/extras\/gp.png?t=1564632316\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1129060\/extras\/gameplayicons_inter.jpg?t=1564632316\" \/><br><br>The player will need to search and examine every nook and cranny of the world around them in order to progress.
