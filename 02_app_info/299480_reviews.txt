I know how that feels.\n\nThat said, taking this game for what it is, it's actually a pretty good time. I've had this in my library for quite a while and just started it, so far I'm really enjoying the progression and the arcade twin stick action. I'm a big fan of rogue likes so this really scratches the right itch for me.\n\nDefinitely reccomend this game if you're open minded about what you're getting and you don't have expectations the game cannot meet.\n\nThe 100% completion route is VERY repetitive and grindy. You've been warned.","timestamp_created":1524239282,"timestamp_updated":1609861767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530545294284820557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49aPP6fYCf5PTngE="}
