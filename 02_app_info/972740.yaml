    about_the_game: <strong>KOBOLD</strong> is a new kind of horror experience that
      blurs the line between cinema and VR gaming. Step into the shoes of an urban
      explorer investigating the mysterious case of a missing boy. Pick up your flashlight
      and discover the secrets of an abandoned villa in the middle of a dark forest
      in Germany.  Immerse yourself in true, cinematic realism, explore an interactive
      universe, pick up clues and dare to venture deeper into a mystical world where
      your actions can have grave consequences.  With its intensely realistic visuals
      captured with photogrammetry, free movement and intuitive interactions, KOBOLD
      is a unique room scale VR experience that will entice and terrify...<br><br>A
      trans-media experience, <strong>KOBOLD</strong> is accompanied by a short film
      that can be viewed  before entering the VR experience. The short film serves
      as an introduction into the world and characters and tells the backstory of
      the missing boy and his family.  It is available to watch for free on the KOBOLD
      website. The player then puts on a VR headset and steps into the story, breaking
      into the abandoned villa, gathering clues, solving a mystery and entering a
      dark, mythical underworld inspired by European folklore and pagan mythology.<br><br>In
      order to make the transition from film to VR as immersive as possible, the entire
      villa (which is a real location in Brandenburg, Germany) and its surroundings
      were meticulously scanned with photogrammetry. Actors were also 3D scanned and
      brought to life in VR using motion capture and advanced facial capture technology.<br>AAA
      graphics from an indie studio, with character and level design, compelling gameplay
      and intuitive interactivity designed from the ground up for the Oculus Rift
      and HTC Vive.
