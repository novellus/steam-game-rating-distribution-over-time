    review: "[b]GENERAL OVERVIEW[/b]\nPurchased on June 4, 2016, I first played this\
      \ game only 12 days after the release. The game was incredibly fun and simple,\
      \ and I was able to get the hang of it very quickly. I was excited to see what\
      \ content the devs added in the future, but that day never came. The game was\
      \ just abandoned.\n\n[b]WHY NOT RECOMMENDED?[/b]\nAlthough this game is quite\
      \ fun and entertaining, their are two reasons why I wouldn't advise you to waste\
      \ your money on this game, even if it's only 99\xA2. First off, the game gets\
      \ old and repetitive very quick, so you probably won't get more than an hour\
      \ of gameplay out of this game before you'll lose interest. Secondly, as stated\
      \ previously, this game is abandoned, and therefore won't be receiving any further\
      \ updates, and no more updates means no more content for you to play.\n\n[b]FINAL\
      \ THOUGHTS[b/]\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a fun game to play for\
      \ an hour or two for really cheap, you've found your game! But if you're looking\
      \ for a game that gets regular updates, or really and updates at all, this game\
      \ is probably isn't for you."
