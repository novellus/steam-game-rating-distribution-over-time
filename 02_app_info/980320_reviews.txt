Sooo much potential!\n\nProblems I've gotten frustrated with:\n*Held items still have collision. So trying to hold an item, like a book, can be more difficult than you expect it to be when you are near a wall, for example.\n*The teleport function requires a twist of the arm, instead of the usual joystick-controlled teleport aim. Something that wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't for the next frustration...\n*Each time you teleport forward (twisting your hand 90 degrees), to keep going forward you have to twist in the opposite direction each time. I can't explain this one.\n*Valve Index Knuckles support is sorta there, but the hand pose is wrong so it makes it difficult to play with. Had to switch to HTC Wands.\n*Having a quick-turn option would be EXTREMELY helpful in this type of game (using joystick left/right or touchpad swipe)\n*Books constantly fall through floor and disappear completely making progress impossible.\n*Books, when grabbed, frequently get positioned on the hand at weird angles. It makes it difficult to see the text of the book when it's backwards. I'm afraid to put the book down to fix this....because the book might fall through the floor and disappear. \n\nFix the glitchy user experience, and this will be a top-notch game!","timestamp_created":1603038575,"timestamp_updated":1603038575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4me+invUCfqbVqAI="}
