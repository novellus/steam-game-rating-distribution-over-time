    developer_response: "Thank you for purchasing our product, your time and review.\
      \  \n\nAbout the ideals of hatred:\n---------------------------------\n\nHate\
      \ is very problematic. The ideals that often justifies hatred often only serves\
      \ those that harbor hate or are motivated by it. Responses to life challenges\
      \ that are only motivated by hate can instigate more hatred, resentment, conflict\
      \ and even extremism. Your actions should never be motivated by hate but by\
      \ understanding and consideration. \n\nExample of how hate related motivation\
      \ can be dangerous and harmful:\n\n1.\tHate Problem: I hate to hear this child\
      \ cry. \n2.\tHate Solution: Because I hate hearing this child cry, I want it\
      \ to stop now. I put the child away or may cause more harm to the child as a\
      \ result of anger.\n\nExample of how motivation through consideration and understanding\
      \ can be productive:\n\n1.\tUnderstanding the Problem: I understand why a child\
      \ is crying and I want to help. \n2.\tUnderstanding the Solution: The child\
      \ is afraid and alone. I will supply moral support, affirmation and attention\
      \ to curb his/her fear thus solving the problem of why he/she was crying.\n\n\
      As we gain understanding and consideration, our outlook on life can motivate\
      \ a willingness to be useful and helpful in the midst of challenges. Hate can\
      \ instigate resentment, anger and fear. \n\nAbout our organization:\n---------------------------\n\
      \n1. We do not endorse any groups nor are we affiliated with any groups or organizations.\n\
      \n2. Please read about us to learn more. Read here or by visiting our website.\n\
      \nOur Philosophy\n\nWe at BehateFree.org support the freedom of belief, fair\
      \ expression, the right to one's own opinions, and the right to abstain from\
      \ the opinions and expressions that define others, all under the guidance of\
      \ justice, our common desire for human dignity, our inalienable human and civil\
      \ rights, and under the full consideration of ALL people from every nationality,\
      \ cultural background, religious belief or personal perspective.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\
      \nEven if you don't believe that the world would be better if we were all \"\
      hate free\", it is safe to assume that violence, hate related crimes, wars and\
      \ world wide conflict would be a lot less if everyone had less of \"hate\".\
      \ The passion of \"hate\" has proven to have negative side effects, this is\
      \ self evident.  \n\n*This is a self help application that allows you to level\
      \ up your progress so it can be considered a game or application. Our right\
      \ to abstain from any political debate is a gift of freedom, it is not bigotry.\
      \ We prefer not to hold open discussions or debates on Steam in this way which\
      \ also reflects Steam's community rules. \n\nThanks again for your initial support\
      \ and for taking the time for your observations."

    review: "\nIt's important that people know this is not a game. It's a presentation\
      \ of some videos with some very general ideas about interaction that are not\
      \ very informative. The videos are of reasonable quality, and I am quite sure\
      \ they were not produced by this developer. I trust that they do have rights\
      \ to use them, though I have not investigated this. A little later you are presented\
      \ with very slowly revealed text in much too large a font, with the pieces being\
      \ so small that you have to click many times to read a whole paragraph. I would\
      \ prefer to just read the text. At this stage, the accompanying pictures were\
      \ of no significance. Then, you are asked a number of questions which I found\
      \ to be rather aimless and even this part does not constitute any kind of game\
      \ or quiz. There is nothing to enjoy here. I believe it ought to be made clearer\
      \ that you are not buying any kind of a game when you purchase this application.\n\
      \nIt has long been said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\
      \ Here we have a similar situation but the road is a rollercoaster on a very\
      \ steep and fast dive.\n\nThe first comment I must make about this product is\
      \ that it seems to endorse or support some very dangerous groups who do not\
      \ have good intentions towards their fellow man. That is not acceptable under\
      \ any circumstances in my view, and it can often have dangerous results. It\
      \ may be that the developer is not aware of the nature of these groups, or they\
      \ have themselves been influenced by propaganda. \n\n I expect the developer\
      \ does genuinely want to help people, but I think they need to spend a lot more\
      \ time exploring human nature and emotions before they are well equipped to\
      \ do so. I have already presented my review of the application, and now think\
      \ it is reasonable to present my view of the philosophy it seems to espouse,\
      \ as that is the purpose of the product as opposed to providing a game to play.\n\
      \n The ideas presented are deeply flawed and are not the result of anybody sufficiently\
      \ experienced or knowledgeable to understand the things they are attempting\
      \ to teach others about.\n\n There is a very sinister, manipulative presence\
      \ in modern culture that attempts to demonise certain things and then rally\
      \ people to join them in hating it, as this often allows desperate or vulnerable\
      \ people to be manipulated to suit the purposes of others. It is very much cult-like\
      \ behaviour, and I worry about it. The very strange fetishisation of \"hate\"\
      \ throughout this product hints at dangerous and misguided obsession. A Steam\
      \ review is really no the place for philosophy, so I will make the briefest\
      \ attempt I can at illustrating how ridiculous and misguided it is to wage this\
      \ \"war on hatred\".\n\n I hate a child in pain. I hate my relatives suffering.\
      \ I hate it when somebody is discriminated against because of innate traits\
      \ which they have no control over. I hate it when a natural disaster kills hundreds\
      \ of innocent people.  I hate it when women are raped or otherwise abused. I\
      \ hate it when families suffer hardships and are not able to survive. I hate\
      \ it when people die, sometimes on a massive scale, in warfare. I hate the abuse\
      \ of animals. I hate bigotry and I hate misunderstanding which leads to bigotry.\n\
      \n I will continue to hate all of these things, and I would suggest that if\
      \ a person doesn't hate them, there may be something wrong with them and they\
      \ ought to not be allowed to enter into positions of responsibility.\n\n It's\
      \ rudimentary to understand that human emotions are related to one another.\
      \ It is dangerously simplistic to think that you can eliminate one of them.\
      \  Without hatred, love cannot be.\n\n Being free of hatred is a very dangerous\
      \ concept. I hate it when I hear a child cry. This makes me want to find out\
      \ why the child is crying so I may do something about whatever ails them. I\
      \ hate it when a relative of mine is sick or in pain, so I do all within my\
      \ power to keep them healthy and happy. I hate it when innocent people are hurt\
      \ or are the victims of injustice, so I do all I can to prevent such things.\n\
      \n I wish the best to the developer of this product, but I implore them, learn\
      \ more; learn a lot more before you risk influencing and possibly damaging vulnerable\
      \ people who are looking for help.\n\n The final thing I will say is that the\
      \ exclusive and horribly intolerant approach the developer has towards communication\
      \ on the application's forums seems steeped in the most intense bigotry. Exchange\
      \ of information and ideas is beneficial. Bigotry holds us all back. If you\
      \ do not accept their prescribed view, then you are not allowed to partake.\
      \ That road leads to fascism."
