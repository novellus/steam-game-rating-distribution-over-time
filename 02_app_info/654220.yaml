    review: "Pros\n\n- Digital book keeping. No more forgetting to add POIs. No accidentally\
      \ bumping damage cubes or hot spots.\n- Faster setup / tear down than the physical\
      \ version\n\nMiddle Ground\n\n- Graphics work well for this sort of game. Not\
      \ really sure what is up with the \"Incredibles\" soundtrack though.\n\nCons\n\
      \n- Very bare bones. Expansions add A LOT of replayability to this game. \n\
      - Action menu is atrocious \n- Lack of \"undo\" can absolutely ruin games, especially\
      \ when coupled with the way actions are selected.\n- Gamepad controls are hit\
      \ or miss. The \"snap to grid\" is either too sensitive or too sluggish.\n\n\
      Seeing as how I own all but two expansions for the physical version, you could\
      \ say I'm a fairly big fan of Flash Point. At full price, I cannot recommend\
      \ this game.\n\nI would only recommend this game on sale, and even then, at\
      \ a sideways thumb. If you were wanting to get the physical version, just get\
      \ that. It's basically the same price as this game, and you'll have a lot more\
      \ fun with it. Flash Point Digital might be for you if you already have the\
      \ physical version, and would like to play it more than you can due to life\
      \ circumstances, or if you think it could be fun despite the cons I listed above."
