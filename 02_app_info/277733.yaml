    about_the_game: "Packing 5,000 horsepower and a 20-cylinder engine, the SD80MAC\
      \ was a regular coal hauler across Pennsylvania, and is now here in CSX livery\
      \ for Train Simulator.<br><br>Thirty units were built by EMD for Conrail between\
      \ 1995 and 1996 and were the first diesel locomotives to use a 20-cylinder engine\
      \ since EMD\u2019s SD45 and SD45-2 models. Their huge motive power and 75mph\
      \ (121 km/h) top speed also made them slightly more powerful than GE\u2019s\
      \ EVO series, making them ideal candidates for the heavy coal trains of Pennsylvania.<br><br>The\
      \ SD80MAC was also fitted with recessed red marker lights in the nose, a feature\
      \ unique to Conrail locomotives and something that remained when Conrail was\
      \ split up; 17 locomotives were taken on by Norfolk Southern and 13 by CSX.\
      \ As with most modern era EMD units, the Class was also fitted with electronic\
      \ display screens for instrument readouts and the usual EMD dynamic braking\
      \ system.<br><br>The EMD SD80MAC for Train Simulator is seen as it operates\
      \ today for CSX in their recent YN3 scheme. Detailing features include step\
      \ lights, cab lights, multi-function displays, heavy braking system/train brake\
      \ control and in-cab signalling that can be used on the NEC: New York-New Haven\
      \ route. Also included with the locomotive are CSX coal hoppers.<br><br>The\
      \ locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive\

    review: 'IT''s a fairly decent locomotive. My only frustration is that it freezes
      with the 64-bit and runs ok in 32-bit

      has anyone been able to figure out how to  get it to run in the 64-bit? if you
      did plz let me know how you did it. it''ll be greatly appreciated.

      Thanks'
