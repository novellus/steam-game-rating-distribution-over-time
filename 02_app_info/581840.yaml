    about_the_game: All or something is preventing and helping, freezing and melting,
      braking and slipping, glowing and fading. The devices are subordinated with
      the common laws of a puzzle. That, that is melted that will not be frozen and
      will not swim. But there is something unfired that drowning and freezing. The
      Ice bridges are not for the fire coals. The Steps in the portal come from the
      place of falling, clamping or a star.

    review: 'The goal of this game is simple -- in each stage (level/puzzle), you
      move blocks around to allow you to collect a star, move a block onto a button,
      and go through the exit portal.  Similarly, the rules are simple (for example,
      stone blocks can be pushed one space forward on non-ice surfaces, ice blocks
      slide across the ground, other blocks slide on ice, fire blocks melt ice, etc).  How
      you accomplish the goal is anything but simple, especially in the later stages.  These
      puzzles are very well-designed, often requiring significant logical thinking
      to deduce the correct solution.


      There are 30 stages total, grouped into 6 areas, and you must complete all 5
      stages in one area before you can proceed to the next area.  There are different
      types of blocks (stone, ice, fire/red-hot, freezer, flame-thrower, and teleporter),
      which allow for very diverse and intricate puzzles.  I did not encounter any
      errors or inconsistent behavior.


      If you''re a puzzle enthusiast, I definitely recommend this game.  I found it
      to be extremely fun and satisfying, and you can''t beat the price.'
