    review: 'It''s an okay addition, and fills the gap for dual faction cards not
      met by previous expansions. Definitely feel that the SE+MC combo was the clear
      winner here, as Missile Silo and Alignment Bot (pictured in the screens on store
      page) are both very solid inclusions.


      To put it bluntly, the SE+MC cards can convince you to go for that kind of deck.
      the TF+B cards you just kinda pick up if you were already going that direction
      and there isn''t anything better on the field anyway.'
