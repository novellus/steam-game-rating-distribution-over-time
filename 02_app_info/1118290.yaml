    about_the_game: Always presenting itself as one of the most gruelling rally locations
      on any race calendar, stages in Greece feature dusty roads and hidden rocks,
      capable of severely damaging cars that cut corners or run too wide in the wrong
      places. The dusty conditions mean visibility can become an issue for drivers
      further down the running order. Greece Rally will be accessible through My Team,
      Custom Championships and Time Trial.
