    reviews: "\u201CFor the first time in my VR playing life, I could picture just\
      \ sitting in a VR boat on a lake, with a real beer by my side and just passing\
      \ out while the fish nibble away at my line without a care in the world\u2026\
      I love this game!\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thevrgrid.com/catch-and-release/\"\

      \ in the end: Catch &amp; Release is a Software Gem with lots of charm, which\
      \ raises your mood. And this is explicitly so, not only for fishing fans, but\
      \ also, or maybe especially so, for fishing noobs.\u201D<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a\

      \ Release is the epitome of a relaxing VR fishing experience. It feels so great\

    review: 'Will it VR?: Yes. Quietly. Gently. Peacefully.


      Fishing games seem like one of those genres that fit right in with VR. Not surprisingly,
      there are a lot of them. They come in all shapes and sizes, from attempts at
      pure realism to goofy novelty games. Catch and Release falls very comfortably
      in the middle, and that balance has made it my favorite VR fishing game.


      To be clear, this is not a fishing simulator. It does not attempt to realistically
      teach you the ins and outs of actual real-world fishing. There are games that
      try to do that, with varying degrees of success. Those games are like trying
      to break into professional competitive fishing. Catch and Release is more like
      going fishing with your dad as a kid (or at least with my dad). It''s chill.
      It''s relaxed. There''s a beer on the boat. You can''t drink it.


      The fish are not real-world specimens, but unique to the lake depicted in the
      game. They look good, though, and you can definitely see what they are referencing
      (I caught enough panfish with my dad to know that the Krapzy is a Crappie).
      You can weigh your fish and decide what to do with each. If you think it''s
      small, you''ll get more money for tossing it back, but if it''s big, you''ll
      get more money for keeping it. You have to learn what sizes are big and small
      for each species, so there is some trial and error involved. Use the money to
      buy new equipment. Nothing to serious; again, this isn''t a simulator.


      You''ll be kept busy by an ever-updating list of objectives to complete. Finish
      off a batch and you''ll get a reward, along with a new, more challenging to-do
      list.


      The fishing itself is fine. Nothing fancy - cast, wait, fight, land. The fighting
      can be a bit tricky to learn. Remember to listen to the pole, and don''t let
      the tension get too high. Slack the line if you need to; it''s better to prolong
      the fight than lose the fish.


      There is a radio in the game with some music loaded in, but I prefer to put
      on a podcast while I fish. It''s a great way to relax.
