It's a simple retro-feeling puzzle-adventure game (sort of like Pitfall 2, Metroid, etc.), but much more polished, which made it a more enjoyable experience for me.  I never got tired of the music, so that made it good in my mind.  The option to choose the machine you play the game on was a nice touch.  \n\nAs someone whose appreciation of simple-ish, short-ish has grown in recent years, I consider this to be one of the best games I've finished recently, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's at least partially interested/has any enjoyment of retro-feeling games.","timestamp_created":1605064879,"timestamp_updated":1606099973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uJbB+fUCcrPWrQI="}
