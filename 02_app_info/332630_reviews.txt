In its own genre it's probably OK. The visuals are stylish and the sound design is quite awesome.\nBut the story doesn't really catch your attention. The monologues and occasional dialogues are quite unnatural. And the gameplay part just plainly sucks. You walk slowly, you need to backtrack the levels all the time, it's surprisingly hard to find a proper spot to start climbing a ladder. So, all in all, as a game this thing kind of fails.\nSome people will like it, I'm sure. But personally I'm not a fan.","timestamp_created":1604524776,"timestamp_updated":1604524776,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpKPIyvUCdbSqrAI="}
