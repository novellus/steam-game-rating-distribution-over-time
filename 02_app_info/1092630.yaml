      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Overview</h2>Rogue Glitch is a platformer's paradise within
      a roguelite world of procedurally generated levels and arrays of enemies. Develop
      your character each run with random items ranging from incremental stat modifiers
      to lethal showers of bullets. Expand your arsenal to include the full range
      of items Rogue Glitch has to offer by leveling up; then crush bosses to access
      unique glitched versions of your former self. <br><br><br><strong>Play solo
      or up to four players to conquer the glitchworld.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Solo play and online/local co-op<br></li><li>More than 100
      unique items to collect<br></li><li>10 character variants each with upgrading
      stats and skins<br></li><li>A narrative told through completion events</li></ul><h2
      class="bb_tag">Movement</h2>Fluid movement is the core component to making a
      platforming focused roguelite. Auto-targeting projectiles will fire as you remain
      within proximity of enemies and a downward stomp allows you increase your damage
      output. Learn the different enemy types and behaviours to achieve a devastating
      finesse in combat.<h2 class="bb_tag">Progression</h2>Rogue Glitch is packed
      with unlockable items, characters and cosmetics to make every run a worthwhile
      one. Experience is awarded based on performance which will provide random item
      unlocks on level-ups. Bosses drop a currency called Malbytes which can be used
      to upgrade your existing characters into more powerful evolutions. Finally,
      each completion of a run will progress the story with a mysterious lovable villain,
      earning the new character variants.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>You were once
      a regular platforming character, running, jumping and shooting in your little
      2D world. However things are starting to get weird. Your levels are being scrambled,
      pick-ups modified, and enemies mutating, The origins of these happenings are
      unclear but you are curious enough to proceed deeper into the unknown. You meet
      an ominous being who wants to make a deal...<h2 class="bb_tag">The Future</h2>Rogue
      Glitch was created for quick iteration and evolution. More items and characters
      are already on the way but we're excited to hear your ideas for glitched entities
      to distort your game. Leave your suggestions in the Community Hub to help evolve
      Rogue Glitch throughout 2019. For more information on Early Access, read above
      this section.

    review: "Es un roguelike de acci\xF3n, con la particularidad de que el personaje\
      \ dispara autom\xE1ticamente a los enemigos cercanos. Tenemos entre varios personajes\
      \ diferentes para elegir, podemos subir de nivel cada uno de forma permanente\
      \ por fuera de partida y vamos desbloqueando los power ups que nos pueden salir\
      \ en la partida. El juego actualmente est\xE1 en early access, sin embargo lo\
      \ veo muy completo, y por el precio en descuento me parece una ganga. Por \xFA\
      ltimo considero que puede ser un buen juego para iniciar en este g\xE9nero,\
      \ para los que no andan familiarizados con este."
