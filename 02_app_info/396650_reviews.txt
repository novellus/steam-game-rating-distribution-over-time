Because:\n[list]\n[*] it is a Sci-Fi date simulator, that merges romances with Mech fightings;\n[*] it has beautiful graphics & wonderful characters, both the females & the males, although I, of course, liked them in a different way ;-) ;\n[*] it offers a very good plot, with 5 different routes (4 for love, and one for friendship with the most important male character of the cast except yourself as protagonist). I completed all those routes, and I loved everyone of them! \n[/list]\n\nWhat makes this VN unique? \n[list]\n[*] its [b] humour, [/b] which is always funny without ever being gross;\n[*] its [b] love stories, [/b] which are amusing & touching at the same time;\n[*] its [b] dubbing, [/b] which is BY FAR THE BEST ENGLISH DUBBING I have ever found in a VN. \n[/list]\n\n[b] My final rank = 9/10.
