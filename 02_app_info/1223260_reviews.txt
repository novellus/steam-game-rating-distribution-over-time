This game feels like a blast to the past. The game is similar to a classic dungeon crawler, with gameplay that reminds me of Morrowind or Oblivion. The controls are pretty easy to pick up and learn, and the combat is pretty straightforward. I thought it was a good game.\n\nThen when I figured out that the game is comedic, it made my playing more enjoyable. I wasn't extremely impressed at first, but after learning that the game parodies classic tropes and that it realizes that it's doing it, it made playing the game more fun. I found myself attacking random objects for the funny and random comments that the character would make about the action.\n\nThe only downside to me is the combat music. It isn't bad by any means, but it gets a little repetitive and doesn't exactly fit with the rest of the game's music or aesthetic. But that isn't much different to the older games that this is based off of and parodying.\n\nOverall the game is fun and I recommend it to anyone that wants to enjoy a simple classic dungeon crawler with a comedic element.","timestamp_created":1585279832,"timestamp_updated":1593833577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4osv4i/MCf9uz+wE="}
