XD\n\nAfter playing the game for a little bit, my only complaints would be that there is no tutorial or help screens to show what the controls are, and I've found a weird glitch where my weapons disappear on screen but are still able to be used. I would also say that $10 is a bit much, but considering this is a game made out of an Indie developer's love for old flash games, I'm okay with it.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with a bit of nostalgia to those old flash games, this game does a good job of it without using fancy graphics, overly-smooth animations, or complex controls (although the voice acting is SPOT ON XD). It's a great time waster, too. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game.\n\nKeep Defending Thy Buttress!","timestamp_created":1513117790,"timestamp_updated":1513117790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482488304376602173","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw86W2puACdp39kQE="}
