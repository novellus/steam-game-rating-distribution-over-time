    review: 'here''s what i like about the game its tough, you have unlimited ammo  in
      sense you can just keep going back to get more. the zombies are tough as heck.
      things i was not keen on: one gun , area super dark so hard to see where certain
      doors are , like the amount of time during nights, but wish there were more
      types of defense. lurkers causing trouble place spikes down, something.  graphics
      are pretty neat didn''t expect lurkers to be super quick lol overall it''s a
      fun little distraction. hoping to see if it gets improved on.'
