It's happened to me when adjusting the shirt, or moving the eyebrow up and down, or recolouring it. It looks like it's cut in half, not symmetrical at all. Deleting and re-adding it doesn't fix the glitch, neither does saving then loading, or using a different eyebrow. If this glitch happens, that character's eyebrow will be bugged permanently. \n\nThere are only two body types for men - muscle freak and skinny welp. It would be nice to have an average body. I concur with other users who say there need to be more parts. A lot more.\n\nRecolouring the skin via the face menu made half of my character's face disappear. When I adjusted the forehead texture, it reappeared (and then disappeared again).\n\nCan't resize ears.\n\nThe colour system makes it hard to find the shade I want. It runs on blue/yellow/pink sliders which you have to adjust to find what you want. A colour chart or wheel would be much more simple. I feel the reason it's done this way is because the dev didn't know how to do a colour chart.\n\nWhen I save my portrait it doesn't let me choose where. It just saves it to the Portrait Wizard folder automatically. I can't save to my desktop or Documents, for example. By default the Portrait Wizard folder is buried deep in the Steam file... so it will be something like MyPC/C:/Games/Steam/Steamapps/Common/PortraitWizard/Portraits/Portrait.bmp. The only way to get to this folder quickly is by creating a shortcut, which is more clutter for my desktop or start menu.\n\nThis was just too broken for me. I refunded.","timestamp_created":1604099137,"timestamp_updated":1604101198,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.409768283367156982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1604409349,"developer_response":"Okay I have never heard about that eyebrow glitch before.
