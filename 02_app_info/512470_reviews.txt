Also then you can restart whenever you want. Instead of losing everything you bought when starting a new game, this is the reason why I  haven't bought anything yet.\nOtherwise it's a great game with great graphics and mechanics.\nTruly a game I long searched for and final found!!!!\n\nPS: This game is also available in the windows store but there where problems with the  save files; I couldn't get passed the 3th tutorial quest. So just play it trough steam and you'll be fine.","timestamp_created":1486488606,"timestamp_updated":1580490462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54145437479019165","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws9Kk/u8Cd47GcQ=="}
