    reviews: "<p>\u201CA trip well worth taking. Most relaxing and enjoyable I thought,\
      \ with enough challenge to keep experienced adventurers entertained and enough\
      \ guidance for new players to join in and have plenty of fun.\u201D<br>80% &ndash;\
      \ Quandary</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t <p>\u201CIf you have read the book, you should\
      \ still enjoy the game and appreciate both the faithfulness to its source material\
      \ and the liberties taken with the material. If the game is your first exposure\
      \ to MOTOE, then it is most likely inevitable that you will then want to read\
      \ the book\u201D<br>91% &ndash; Just Adventure</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t <p>\u201CThere's\
      \ nothing here that hasn't been done before in many other adventure games before\
      \ it, but Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express is a splendid showcase\
      \ of richly compelling narrative and atmosphere at work, and is likewise a title\
      \ I wouldn't hesitate recommending to any adventure game fan.\u201D<br>80% &ndash;\
