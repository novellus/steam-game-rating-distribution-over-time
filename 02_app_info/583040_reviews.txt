And worse, each save data icon doesn't show any difference (like the date/time you saved the game or the name of your daughter, or anything). It does have number, but sadly the number is too small and aren't placed correctly (2nd are in the middle of 1st and 2nd save icon, and the 9&10th's save icon doesn't even have number). And this way, it's very hard to look for a certain save data, esp if you haven't been playing it for a while.\n\nIt's also frustrating that the daughter could still refuse to fight despite being OP. Esp on early exploration, the daughter could ends up being killed first. I also kept getting crash on errant quest thus making me unable to complete the map.\n\nHarvest festival is another annoying thing. We are forced to join, and even when we can choose to rest, we are forced to see the other competition. Why should we care to see the other competition while the dialogue did nothing significant? It couldn't even be skipped.\n\nThere story and interaction are also very lacking, although tbf this is a very old game, so I shouldn't expect too much..","timestamp_created":1608739398,"timestamp_updated":1608901095,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45c3+zPYCe+/BvAI="}
