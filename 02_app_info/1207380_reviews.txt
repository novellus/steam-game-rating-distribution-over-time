It was a surprise stream for me, and chat and I loved it. A surprise hit. This one, not so much. It follows a similar pattern but the writing just isn't as funny or creative as the first. We encountered a couple of glitches where the character was in the gully height when above it, and vice versa but a quick world reset by going in and out of nearest door fixed that.   The game is also very short compared to the first one, and the final fight is copy paste same style as AB Cheapskate. \n\nWas disappointed with this, but it's not like they are asking for a huge amount of money. If you haven't played the first Adventure Boy, go play that. But this one. maybe stay clear.","timestamp_created":1593705410,"timestamp_updated":1593705410,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3dWPiPMCdqudkgI="}
