With true historical events in the background, you can mainly expect challenging puzzles and difficult battles, but also stealth passages and important decisions. You will come across wizards with false identities, possessed devil worshipers, sexual demons, and beasts from hell, as well as creatures well-known from European mythology.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1228500\/extras\/StoreGif1.gif?t=1601443236\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dark fantasy story<\/h2>Europe is in the middle of religious upheaval and many preachers predict that the end of the world is near. The year is 1428 and the Hussites have just set out on their Silesian campaign. These heretics appear to be the biggest threat in the kingless country.

Remember one thing: being outnumbered is a problem! If three or more opponents attack you at the same time, you will die! The key is to take advantage of their mistakes, wait for the right moment, and then attack. You will face not just knights, villagers, and highwaymen, but also various supernatural beings - and you shouldn't underestimate them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diverse environments<\/h2>During the game, you will move around on foot as well as in the saddle. You will visit various real as well as fictitious places in medieval Silesia. You will plunder villages, doggedly defend streets of towns, and explore places such as secret dungeons, abandoned mines, or forbidden sections of monasteries. For example, you can look forward to visiting Röwersdorf, Nysa, the Brzeg monastery, or the Rabesberg castle.","about_the_game":"Shadows over Silesia is a dark action adventure game with fantasy elements, set in real medieval Europe.
