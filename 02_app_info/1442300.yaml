    review: 'Will it VR?: Oh, most assuredly.


      Okay, I admit it. I''m a bit of a sucker for cooking games. This one, though,
      is by far my favorite - on any platform, of any type. It is absolutely perfectly
      paced. It is definitely challenging, but very fair, and just when you master
      your tools, something new is thrown in. The medieval setting is unique and engaging,
      and the ability to improve your food stall with beefed-up ovens, pots, etc.
      gives the game a very campaign-like feel. A few times during the game you get
      a major promotion (from serving peasants to nobility, and then from nobility
      to royalty), giving you an entirely new set of customers, new recipes, and a
      new kitchen.


      If you enjoy this type of time-management cooking simulation, I really can''t
      recommend this enough. It is super fun, super cute, and super rewarding when
      you finally master those tough recipes. The "boss" stages - where you have to
      cook a large quantity of recipes quickly for a party - can be a bit tough, but
      honestly, they don''t happen often and offer up a fun challenge.
