    review: "I usually like these types of games but this one I just cant give a positive\
      \ review. \nThumbs up to all the people who mentioned all the flaws before and\
      \ the devs fixed those but..... The moving around in the game is very weird\
      \ and confusing. I moved around for a long time with nowhere to go until I finally\
      \ had to give up and use a hint to find my way and it pointed through a wall.\
      \ I was like, really? What kind of portal or magic is this? Turned out it took\
      \ me back downstairs. It literally looks like moving through a wall.\nThe second\
      \ thing I hated about the game is the ending. And I am one of the few who even\
      \ bothered finishing the game... all for nothing just to see that..."
