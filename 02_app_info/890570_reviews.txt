That being said the game still hasn't received an update for a fair while. I do wish the dev the best and hope his situation improves.\n\nI can't remember the last time I've played an early access game oozing with this much potential. For fans of Jagged Alliance or Fallout 1 and 2, this is a no-brainer. The developer (as far as I'm aware, the only one working on the game) has put in an absolutely phenomenal amount of work in the illustration for everything from the ominous and richly detailed post-apocalyptic world, to each individual item of equipment. Everything has a really grungy aesthetic that I love. The various weapons and armor you can get your hands on look, frankly, badass. The mutants previewed in the dev blogs look suitably really messed up and creepy; all the better for blasting away. \n\nSpeaking of blasting, the combat is extremely visceral and immensely satisfying. Just wait until the havoc you'll unleash when you get your hands on an automatic shotgun or minigun. Unlike the original Fallouts, it plays out in real time - kind of like an RPG version of the old isometric action shooter Crusader: No Remorse. For a game this early into development, there's a truly staggering array of weapons ranging from swords and blades, to conventional firearms to laser weapons and explosives. Honestly I don't think even Fallout 1 and 2 had this many weapons. While it's great fun to blast your enemies away into gory piles of meat, you can be just as fragile in the right circumstances, so you do need to approach a lot of the battles with tactical foresight. \n\nBut it's not just all guns n' guts and gore. The RPG mechanics are really solid, too. The trait system is immensely flexible and I'm sure open for plenty of replayability. Uniquely, your character can actually accumulate various psychoses and paranoias through the course of the game, and these also can affect not only your dialogue choices, but even have some effects in combat. For instance, my character would completely lose control in berserk rage (literally; I couldn't direct him anymore) and just mow down everything in range - friend or foe. Some of these traits you can even inflict on your unfortunate adversaries. For instance, when I blew out what little brains the local Hitler wannabe had left with my rifle and rendered him mentally handicapped. Despite being really early access, there's already an abundance of methods to quest resolution and a lot of groups to align with (or make enemies of.) Fitting with its Fallout inspiration, the game has a lot of dark, bleak humor. Hell, it's dark and bleak in general. Just wait until you see the cannibal farm.\n\nI will caution that it's been a while since the last update, but the developer does remain active in the forums and promises that he is still working on it. I really hope he keeps at it, because he's got a potential winner here.","timestamp_created":1546188059,"timestamp_updated":1609686324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.424242407083511353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsoKy5PYCe8P6tgE="}
