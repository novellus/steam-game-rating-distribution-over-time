    review: '[h1] ern... okay then?! [/h1]


      Warp Drive. i... have no words for this game... it is ern... kinda good, but
      ultra swallow. i mean, this feels like a mobile gacha game wearing an anti-grav
      suit. wich is fine, as long as it is not using MTX, wich it is not at the moment.
      but... i don''t know what to say other than that...


      The graphics 7/10: the are colorfull. nothing "oh, nice graphics", but it has
      its own flavour. like those sweet candy you get on a grocery store that is very
      sweet but also very good. the cell shading is very well done, and all, and all
      the vehicles look interesting, but i gotta warn you one thing, very clearly:


      [h1] IF YOU HAVE PROPENSITY TO EPILEPSY DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME [/h1]


      it flashes collors and flashes it on your face, A LOT. thank goodness i have
      zero issues with this, but this could serve as a warning to anyone that wanna
      play the game.


      Music 7/10: Bland. i was expecting better. the main theme done by Hideki Naganuma
      is actually pretty good, and reminded me a lot of jet set radio, the other musics
      are okay... but nothing catchy


      Gameplay 6/10: again, it is... okay... it doesn''t do anything wrong in this
      regard... but... really there is nothing much to say. once i got a +3 speed
      craft i started obliterating the AI, and got a 17 win streak that seems that
      it will never be beaten. i dunno if it is because i am just good at AG racing
      games, but... welp... i dunno...


      Story: None. it''s a racing game. so i''ll not consider this point. there is
      one or two lines of dialogue from an alien that gives you tutorials and that''s
      it. but i would like some lore. Redout and Ballistic NG have lore, so this game
      should have too.


      Final Veredict: 7/10

      if you''re morbidly curious. get this one on a sale. i heard there is more content
      coming tho. this really should be an early access game. because it feels like
      it. i gonna keep it tho. but i... expected better. i wish there was a neutral
      button on steam tho. i''m iffy on this one.'
