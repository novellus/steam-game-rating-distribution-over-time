    review: 'This game is a gem in the rough, but as it is right now it''s just too
      rough.


      This game isn''t hard, there are some cool historical details, the music is
      nice, but gets repetitive quickly. The events are fun at first, but eventually
      it felt like I was only experiencing the same five events over and over again.
      The biggest problem with the game is that it didn''t really feel like any of
      the stats mattered a whole lot or maybe I couldn''t figure out how to raise
      them up to a point where they would. I also didn''t feel like the journey was
      dangerous. where were the wild beasts and bandits? where were the desert sand
      storms or tumultuous sea voyages?

      Also The way that food is done is really annoying and un-intuitive. The game
      gives you the pounds needed, but then doesn''t tell you how many rations are
      in a pound. I get that if I give food to someone, or if I didn''t budget for
      winter and blizzards pin me down I starve, but why isn''t one unit of rations
      = 1 pound of food? and if it''s not then what is it equal too?

      When I purchased this game I was hoping for either a good story or a trade management
      game, but the game falls short on both sides. As a result, after the first play
      through I didn''t want to play it again. If the game was 4-5 dollars I''d recommend,
      but I felt like some of the content should be more flushed out for that 7-8
      dollar price point.'
