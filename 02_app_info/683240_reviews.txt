Loaded with characters and items to unlock, as well as the ability to battle the ghost characters of other players once you level your own up enough. While playing, Apocalypse Knights comes across as a blend of Darksiders and Dynasty Warriors, with later levels losing almost all resemblance to our world. Zero lag with screenfuls of enemies too, which was nice. Controls very well with mouse and keyboard. Decent audio, but the soundtrack does tend to get a little grating during extended play sessions.\n\nNote this game is built around grinding, so much so that you can let the AI it ships with play for you and even unlock achievements if you'd like...just expect it to nearly die often on higher difficulties. I spent 43 hours unlocking all of the achievements, but you could probably do the same a bit under 38 if you worked at it. I grabbed this during the launch discount at just under 9 dollars, its new price of a little under 6 is a steal.","timestamp_created":1585627565,"timestamp_updated":1585627565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558450102806091309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vJGxl/ECeafO/AE="}
