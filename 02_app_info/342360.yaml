    review: "Train of afterlife runs in adobe flash and doesn't like to run in full\
      \ screen mode (at least not for me) so I already knew I was going to be in for\
      \ a questionable experience before it even really got going.  The game takes\
      \ place on a train after the main characters death. You can walk around the\
      \ train, you can talk to people, you can look out the window. \n\nEventually\
      \ you are able to remember some things that happened while you were still alive.\
      \ The key to playing this game seems to be to remember these memories in a particular\
      \ order with no clues that I could find on how to do that. These memories are\
      \ also way less interesting than what's going on aboard the ghost train. Also\
      \ apparently I looked out the window one too many times and got sent to hell.\
      \ So yeah, not playing this thing again."
