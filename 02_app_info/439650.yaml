    about_the_game: 'Two years have passed since the fated battle between Naruto and
      Sasuke in the Village Hidden in the Leaves. A comfortable peace has fallen over
      the village and the winter festival approaches with a bit more excitement than
      usual. Seasons of war have transformed Naruto and his friends into elite young
      warriors, but now they grow into the adults they were meant to be, forming bonds
      beyond friendship. Naruto and Hinata approach this next stage with trepidation
      and find their progress stalled when a mysterious and dangerous man appears
      with a disturbing message: the end of the world is upon them. Once again Naruto
      and his friends are sent to investigate and stop the impossible, a falling moon!
      What is the tragic fate that connects this disaster with Hinata''s Hyuga Clan?
      And to what lengths will Naruto go to speak the words that will change his life?
      The Last is the final story of Naruto as you knew him, the hero who was once
      an outcast, and the first chapter of the bond that will define his future.'
