I feel like I am playing something from the 90's. The gun is very slow at firing, which can obv. make a big difference in this type of game. I can barely last a minute in this game. There is no screen on telling you which button's to use. You have to figure that out on your own.  No music or anything like that. It is way to expensive for this type of game. I simply did not enjoy this game at all...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCs658tTcsw","timestamp_created":1550635671,"timestamp_updated":1550635783,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506710708141326904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4tYrGhOkCcOqsuwE="}
