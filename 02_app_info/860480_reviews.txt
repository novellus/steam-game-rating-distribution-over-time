This game is quite enjoyable, however its also rather short. The primary reason that I've even played 34 hours is due to trying to complete everything.  (in fact I plan on writing a guide to part of this game here on steam when I get home tonight.)   But this brings up another point I wanted to discuss which is they brought back the record keepers!  Well kind of...  They no longer are physical NPC's on the map but instead are labelled as trophies in their own separate menu.  I've managed to get 18/20 of the gold trophies, and the last two one my playstyle simply put would make it a slog to obtain, and the other I don't know how to get.\n\nBut this brings up something else I want to talk about since this is a Koei Tecmo RPG.  This game and most others made by the company suffer what I call 'Fourth Act Slog' which I will be denoting as FAS from now on.  What is it praytell?  Well most books follow a three act structure of a beginning, middle and end.  KT tends to do four acts though, which are a beginning, middle, wrap up, and end.  However the fourth act KT has a tendency to bog down TERRIBLY.  This game's main plot line the fourth act isn't so bad, its more like how much extra stuff there is to do.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW\nFor example to define the four act structure in this game or at least in my opinion:\nThe first act runs from the start of the game where Alex wakes up in Fernland, all the way up till when you meet Clangorrah for the first time and everyone regains a fragment of their memories after the Stiletto fight.  Or when he finally decides to join the support squad.\n\nThe second act then runs all the way through to the second Belthazar fight and he decides to join the resistance full time.  Or the second Stiletto fight where everyone remembers how they die.\n\nThe third act runs up until the first fight with Endrey and then gaining the ability to finally access Clangorrah's castle.  The Endrey fight in my opinion is actually where this game's writing is at its best.  Sure its foreshadowed, but personally Endrey if he was more developed could sway the story so much.\n\nThe final act actually doesn't occur until you beat Clangorrah and get the normal ending.  Since like every KT game there are two endings, and the 'better' ending requires you to do an additional set of dungeons.  And here like usual there is pretty much no charm within them.  The best thing in the fourth act is honestly the design of the true final boss, which kind of ripped off Neo Exdeath, but I digress.  There's no real character development in the fourth act, and it feels like things were drug out longer than they should have been.  Plus the like 6 bonus dungeons at the end are just that much more extra padding.  But I still recommend.","timestamp_created":1557247506,"timestamp_updated":1557247506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466034203767776489","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ebLyeoCdtrgwAE="}
