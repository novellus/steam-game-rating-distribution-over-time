    about_the_game: Escape from Voyna is an action-packed, gripping and realistic
      single player shooter. It is set in the times of the cold war. On Russian soil.
      After many nuclear tests the country is devastated and an apocalypse is spreading.
      You as a secret agent are stranded on an island trying to escape and not to
      be captured by the enemy soldiers. <br><br>Survive in this unique world and

      /><br><br><br>During the time of the Cold War the major powers attempt to secure
      their power by attempting to build the biggest and best nuclear weapons. Those
      were tested on remote islands. Due to a misfortune, you land on one of those

      forces of the RSWS.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/771400/extras/GAMEPLAY.png?t=1604247252"

      there's always more than one way out. Find the quickest and easiest, because
      this game is hard. It's a tactical shooter. Weapons have realistic recoil and
      should be used for single shots most of the time. There is no HUD showing your
      life or ammunition, no crosshair or hit marker. Hardcore ain't for casual players.
