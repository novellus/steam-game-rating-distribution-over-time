      \ adventure game in full 3D filled with original monsters, music and gameplay.\

      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore 10 levels of monster fighting and puzzle-solving action\
      \ in full 3D. Find the magic key to open the gates and move forward. Collect\
      \ magic diamonds to unlock new levels. As you explore the maze, you smash, fry,\
      \ and blast the monsters. If you solve the puzzles and avoid traps and monsters,\
      \ you will at last rescue your friends and save the day. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The gameplay is based on your ability to spit bubbles that pushes the target\
      \ backwards. The player must use this ability to make opponents and different\
      \ objects collide. Whenever a game entity collides into another, something happens;\
      \ 20 entities means 20 times 20 = 400 possible outcomes. In addition you will\
      \ meet several boss monsters that will put your gaming skills to the test. Sometimes\
      \ the player must release or push different monsters against each other to be\
      \ able to advance. Random effects, odd creatures and exploding objects are part\
      \ of the fun. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you move along, you will find magic fruits\
      \ that gives you special abilities, for example super speed, or powerful chilis\
      \ that makes you shoot exploding bubbles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame levels are\
      \ carefully designed to exploit both the action and puzzle potential of game\
      \ objects and creatures. The player early on meets doors and traps in the literal\
      \ sense of the word. Later on they are blocked by or consists of different monsters,\
      \ and the player must discover different ways to move them away or terminate\
      \ them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not always obvious how to solve the puzzle\
      \ that leads to a new area. The comic animations and intriguing puzzles make\
      \ the game suitable for players of all ages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tootinis are small, peaceful creatures living in a village\
      \ tree just downhill of an old castle. During everyday life they use their ability\
      \ to bubble to transport huge fruits from the surrounding forest and back to\
      \ their village. <br />\r\nThen Lula, a young female Tootini is kidnapped by\
      \ a huge green monster living in the nearby castle. The Tootini rescue team\
      \ fails and are also trapped inside the castle. You are the last hope.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nAbout us<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is developed by the independent\
      \ game studio \xABSkalden AS\xBB in Oslo Norway. We have received support from\
      \ the Norwegian Film Institute, and won Nordic Game programs developers award\
