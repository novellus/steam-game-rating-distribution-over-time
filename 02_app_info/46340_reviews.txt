I advise to run as a single-core or dual-core game and use 'Vista' compatibility and 'higher priority' (Africa1943.bin file, not the exe). It is single-core performance heavy. Still hard to get 60FPS, no matter what CPU/GPU you have.\n\nIt does scale well to higher resolutions and even 21:9.\n\nYou can also run it in 'windowed mode' if you think you still have issues or can squeeze a couple extra frames. [edit ww.ini \"fullscreen:false\"]\n\nI highly recommend to remap the controls to your liking and also the camera and mouse/keyboard speed, if you are now used to modern RTS, fast-pace clicking.","timestamp_created":1609655652,"timestamp_updated":1609657902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu8zF4/YCf939vwI="}
