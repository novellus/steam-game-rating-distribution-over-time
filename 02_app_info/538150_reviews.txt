It's more or less the same movie with some added futuristic Sci-Fi pandering.\n\nThe acting is very sloppy, their are some enjoyable characters but compared to the first film, this one is insanely far fetched and just plain cheesy at times.\n\nSome of the deaths are hilarious.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1672864801\n\nIt's a film I'll quite happily chuck into the good/alright B-Movie pile. Worth a watch if you're a huge fan of Cube.","timestamp_created":1551679627,"timestamp_updated":1551679695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570295274257659912","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iaXUo+kCcdGgvAE="}
