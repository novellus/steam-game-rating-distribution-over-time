I don't know if there's a bug in this chapter, but I missed one object in a scene I couldn't seem to find and another never showed up and then I couldn't go back to get the object I needed. After that, I've had it freeze several times in the middle of game play and I've had it freeze upon trying to load the game. I hate to abandon games, but this isn't the first one I've encountered with such issues.\n\nI would not recommend this game at full price.","timestamp_created":1607631332,"timestamp_updated":1607631332,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwquySp/YCcZvtuAI="}
