I am not a great point & click games fan, so I haven't played a lot of these, which means I am not an expert on this topic.  However, because of the huge number of negative critiques, I have decided to add my own 25 cents to the mix. \n\nThe GOOD.  It is a hidden object and point and click game, and thinking hard is not actually required to play, until you need to solve a puzzle (of which there is a limited number in the game).  The sequence of play is quite simple: find clues, maybe solve a puzzle, analyse the clues, and then try to link them to the different suspects or persons of interest.  The only place where some sweating may be required will be the puzzle solving phase.  Other than that, well, finding some clues can be really difficult as these are sometimes very very hard to find.  But the art is OK, the scenes are all linked together logically, and as such, it works well enough.  And the puzzles at least gave me some much needed brain twists...\n\nThe BAD.  Well, it is supposed to be a \"Sherlock Holmes\" game.  So you should have your brain put into overdrive trying to find links, clues, and possibly make interesting discoveries.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Again, only the puzzles can present some challenge.  The rest, well, is disappointing.  The part where you analyse the clues is so badly done that it is almost all but useless. You are required either to cut up and take samples of tissues or heat something.  Through those very basic analysis, you get Holmes saying something like: \"I think I'll keep that sample for later\".  The only thing that it accomplishes is to have the clue you find appear on the board where you'll establish the links to the suspects.  Music is actually a continuous loop of two short classical music pieces, which means that after playing for some time you could start to wonder if adding a couple more would not have yielded a better user experience...\n\nIn conclusion, I was entertained by the game as I had no preconception of how it was supposed to be played, or how the mechanics of it should work (I suspect a good number of negative reviews come from unmet expectations...)  Many have complained that the clues are too difficult to find.  Well, I DID use a magnifier directly on my screen to find some clues (no, I did not use a walkthrough) as it is true the finding is quite hard in some scenes.  But then who said clue finding had to be easy?  In some places you need to remove an object or solve a puzzle to get to the clue.  Spam-clicking your screen will yield nothing.  The placement of the clues is always logical, so for me it never was an issue.  The game takes about 4 hours to complete.  I played it twice to see if there was some other material showing up, or different outcomes, but sadly there was none.   All in all, I would note this a 5/10.  If interested, buy it on sale (like I did) and you'll get enough entertainment value.  I personally bought it in a bundle with other games at a heavily discounted price.  It helped me cure myself from Covid19 news addiction...","timestamp_created":1608706102,"timestamp_updated":1609724758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/9DE5fYCePyvvAI="}
