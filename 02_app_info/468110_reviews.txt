My wife absolutely loves this game and whenever I ask her if she wants to play a VR game this one is the first thing out of her mouth. \n\nI haven't seen any words from the developers but I think the game has received many themed updates that keep it fresh. For example: around christmas time you'll see special santa babies and reindeer and in October you'll find spooky vampire babies and such. For a cheap price this cute arcade game really is a hidden gem it's a shame it didn't get more popular, this thing is perfect for convincing your wife or SO that the 1k$+ purchases you made for VR were worth it.\n\nFunny story: When she first played it, she wasn't that good and would actually get sad but not from failing levels, she got sad because she thought she was accidentally drowning babies. 8/10 would watch my wife have an existential crisis about helplessly throwing babies in the ocean while trying to convince me she wanted to save them again. Highly recommend if you like cute things and want a cheap game with great mileage.","timestamp_created":1602896998,"timestamp_updated":1602896998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5+WGmvUCcLuoqAI="}
