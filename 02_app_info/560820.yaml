    review: "I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to Hidden Object games, but i can't\
      \ recommend The Saint. Not only does it have the identity issue that a lot of\
      \ the older HOG's have (the word is the wrong one for the object thanks to a\
      \ bad translation). But there are also a bunch of mini games with inane trial\
      \ + error solutions: Unless you are incredibly lucky or incredibly patient then\
      \ you won't find the answer on your own. \nSkip this one."
