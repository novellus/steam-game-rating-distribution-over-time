I just saw it now on sale and picked it up but to be honest. i wish i had paid full price. This game is AWESOME! Like many others have said, the art style is great, the game is very responsive to my quick movements and button presses and the way you tame, train and fight with the monsters is so much fun. The amount of combo attacks is great. You can even use the environment to set up traps with your monsters. The lighting snake is my favorite for this. I struggled at first but once you get the hang of things and learn the attacks and time things right, this game is just awesome. I highly recommend picking it up. I would like to see this game style get AAA backing.
