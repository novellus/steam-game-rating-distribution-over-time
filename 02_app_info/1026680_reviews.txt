Some areas are just as slow, so I can't recommend it to everyone. Another thing that bothered me was the difficulty of the last battle, which was further complicated by the FPS. When modded, this version is excellent, and the game as a whole stands out as one of the best in the franchise. The *3x Boost was a slam dunk. \n\n*Scroll down for a guide on how to improve the FPS. \n*If you haven't applied the mods yet, keep reading.\n\nMODS\nThe best tutorial for explaining the mod process can be found on Youtube. These videos are easy to follow & will explain everything you need to know, including where to download the files.  \n1. Start with *Fans Remaster Final Fantasy 8 Remastered! Mods Setup Tutorial, Part 1* You'll use this method to apply about 5 mods -- Cards, Squall, UI, Weapons, etc...\n2. Then follow up with *Modding Final Fantasy 8 Remastered Guide - Battle Background Textures!* by the same YouTuber. This video explains how to apply various HD models and textures. \n\nFPS IMPROVEMENT\nThis is where the Kaldaien's *Special K tool comes in. Search for *An Unofficial Guide to Special K*. Download it. After that, the application will install to your *Documents folder. As far as I know, you can't change the install location, so you might want to *Hide the folder if that bothers you. \n\nAfter you've applied all the proper downloads, follow the process below:\n\nRun/Inject *Special K --> \nRun *FF8-R on Steam --> \nSpecial K will launch automatically -->\nPress the hotkeys to open the *Control Panel --> \nFind the *Framerate Limited Section --> \nFind *Advanced in the bottom right of the section --> \nBox *Sleepless Window Thread --> \nMove down two sections to *Compatibility Settings -->\nUnbox everything but *OpenGl -->\n\nThis greatly reduces the framerate in most areas (mods or not), but the slowness is still common. The last battle was especially problematic (even with the *3x Boost) because it runs slow during the last boss & its HP is ridiculously high.  \n\nIts not necessary to keep the *Control Panel visible while playing. Simply exit after making the changes and it will keep \"injecting\" in your system tray. Your settings will also be saved, so just be sure to launch Special K before playing the game from now on and it'll work fine.
