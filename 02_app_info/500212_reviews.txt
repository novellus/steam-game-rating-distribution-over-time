The cab and passenger views are nicely made.  The audio is recycled, but okay.  \n\nThere is a glaring issue with this mod's second scenario \"a journey with Hal\".  The second signal out of London Victoria is red when it really should be green.  Requesting permission to move at danger is \"approved\" but it still results in a game over which is very frustrating.  This gets more bothersome when you save at that point and reload where the light changes to green even though it should've been green all along.  \n\nTrain itself is alright, but the scenario as described is not.","timestamp_created":1604615204,"timestamp_updated":1604615204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyp2hzfUCftvHrAI="}
