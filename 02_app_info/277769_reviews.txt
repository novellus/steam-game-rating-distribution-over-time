Well, I have since solve that problem. I noticed the engine is very wheel slip happy, and when you apply sand it only does the front truck. You think that would be no problem, but then it starts acting up again. This time I switched on the second sand button in the cab for both trucks, and I've been down to 10 mph 100% no wheel slip, which by that point you were too far gone spinning you had to restart. I was always a big fan of the \"Big Six\" and so far it has been that one child who behaves half the time, but you still love them.","timestamp_created":1609354766,"timestamp_updated":1609354766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw65zB2vYCdLbuvgI="}
