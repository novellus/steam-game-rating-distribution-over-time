    review: "One would think a puzzle game to put boxes in specific places were going\
      \ to be difficult, or at least increasingly so, but the truth is this game sometimes\
      \ have such easy levels its easy to think it was made just to cheat you out\
      \ of a the little amount it cost. \nWhat I mean is that some levels have boxes\
      \ positioned such that you cannot fail on it, you can basically only push it\
      \ the correct way... \nThen some levels like one every 10 levels have one you\
      \ have to think a little about but its not like its trial and error until you\
      \ get it right, its more like a simple mistake, on a move, which forces you\
      \ to restart the level. \nI just can't recommend this to anyone."
