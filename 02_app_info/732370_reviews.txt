I love Gungeon.  I (mostly) love Nuclear Throne.  It seems like i should enjoy this one.  But it is visually a total mess to me.  There are puddles of various colors on the floor.  Projectiles of various colors flying around.  There are things moving on screen that are enemies, and some moving things that are not.  There are some obstacles on screen that you can walk through, and some that you cannot.  The boundaries of the arena are clear in some cases, and in some cases they are not.  Some enemies immediately die upon reaching zero health, and some enemies do an elaborate death animation.\n\nAll of this adds up to make it almost impossible for me to tell what's happening.  I have no idea what causes me damage about 50 percent of the time.  Even when i CAN tell what hurt me, i'm often incredulous because i was certain i was in a safe spot on the screen, or because i thought some moving thing was just part of the background.  This is all made worse by my own character's projectiles and the various pets who are also frantically running around and shooting.\n\nI don't hate this game.  Maybe i'll even put a few more hours in it, to see if i feel better about it.  But i just can't recommend it.  It's pretty to look at, but a visual mess to actually play.","timestamp_created":1610045916,"timestamp_updated":1610045916,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtuCN7/YCf52swQI="}
