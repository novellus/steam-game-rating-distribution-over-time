Once you play for a bit you understand why different turn speeds and such are important. Basically, the foundation and combat for the game is great.\n\nHOWEVER, and this is why I would NOT recommend the game as it is, it was not utilized well. First off, there is no tutorial. If anybody can tell me what the hell DATA is, feel free to inform. Upgrades seem to reset every level for some reason, and when you reach your third level, MASSIVE difficulty spike. Basically goes from a regular shooter with a few bosses per level to full boss rush within one level transition. Flashbangs, trap black holes, and tracker missiles (which have icons on them, implying you can either dodge or neutralize these missiles but you would be mistaken) are suddenly bombarding you constantly. Get to level three and if you're really unlucky, you'll have died before the screen finally faded off of white. Or you'll get trapped in three black holes and get blasted to hell with tracker missiles. The levels are also really constricted. May be by design but I personally don't like it.\n\nOverall, I think this game would benefit heavily from outsourced play testing BEFORE updates rolled out, even though I think this game is entirely finished and won't be updated further. Either way, as of now I think you have better options out there. Keep looking.","timestamp_created":1607026090,"timestamp_updated":1607026221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/MOOlfYCebeJtwI="}
