    review: "This story has very simplistic writing, which can be a pro or a con depending\
      \ on what you're looking for in your reading. However, the bigger problem is\
      \ that there's no charm in the storytelling. I've read many fics that weren't\
      \ skillfully written but were still compelling because of other things like\
      \ vivid imagery, and endearing characterizations. Those are some things this\
      \ story is severely lacking in. I'll detail what I did and didn't like, but\
      \ be warned that there are spoilers.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The simplicity\
      \ of the writing DOES make it accessible to people of all reading levels and\
      \ to readers beyond sci-fi fans. There aren't many confusing science-y words\
      \ to look up, if any, making it easy to understand the story.\n    [*]There\
      \ are some genuinely nice and/or wholesome interactions with other characters.\
      \ I especially liked the MCs conversations with the sassy AI and interactions\
      \ with the Were people.\n    [*]This story provides LGBTQ+ representation. \n\
      [/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]This could've used more drafts. There\
      \ are some errors that could've been prevented with more editing and revising.\
      \ One of the big ones I've seen is two characters speaking in the same paragraph\
      \ when the bits of dialogue should have been separated as dialogue should be.\n\
      \    [*]With no achievements involved, there are no incentives offered to replay\
      \ this game to see what other routes are like.\n    [*]The process of viewing\
      \ your relationship stats is complete ass. You can only view ONE character's\
      \ progress bar at a time, and every time you'd like to look at your progress\
      \ meter with the companions, you have to do (Show stats + Relationships + Character\
      \ relationships + Choose character). So much unnecessary clicking and wasted\
      \ a lot of time. It would've been nice to see all of the bars for the characters\
      \ laid out together in the same place instead.\n    [*]Characterization for\
      \ the companions is awful. Even the side characters in the locations you visit\
      \ are more interesting than the people who accompany you on your journey. [spoiler]\
      \ For example, Yelena doesn't seem to have any traits other than quiet and nice.\
      \ [/spoiler]\n    [*]This also unfortunately means that the romances are weak.\
      \ [spoiler] There is just no way that Emil can go from huge assh*le to suddenly\
      \ calling you \"dear\" in front of everyone and deeply in love with you to the\
      \ point where he genuinely has to consider choosing between you and his father.\
      \ It's such a short period of time, not enough for this to be believable. [/spoiler]\n\
      \    [*]Building off of the point about characterization, the characters have\
      \ no growth between interactions. The biggest examples that I have played through\
      \ are Emil and Larua.\n[spoiler] Starting with Emil, the only way to progress\
      \ your relationship with him for the first half of the story is to keep taking\
      \ his insults I guess?? You can't pick the options that confront him about his\
      \ poor treatment of you. In the beginning of the game, at your very own birthday\
      \ party, you'll have to act polite with him instead of asking him what he gets\
      \ out of being awful to you in order to unlock dialogue options that will allow\
      \ for your friendship to improve (or your romance to be possible). Another instance\
      \ is when you choose to walk away after he insults you, it decreases your friendship\
      \ level by at least 3%. This is frustrating for people who play the game and\
      \ want to pursue a male/male romance because if you play as a Wispy or a Wanderer,\
      \ this verbally abusive douchebag is the only option. And nearing the end of\
      \ the story, if you choose to be romantically involved with him, all he does\
      \ is pass off his poor behavior towards you as his \"weak attempts at humor.\"\
      \ Sorry, but that's not enough. Where's his motivation? Where's his depth? Give\
      \ me a believable reason as to why he's acted the way he has towards the MC.\
      \ Build up characters' insecurities throughout the story, allude to the key\
      \ events that shaped them as a person, etc. \n\nSimilarly with Larua, you as\
      \ the MC can propose ideas or pose questions that challenge her way of thinking.\
      \ But while it doesn't drop your relationship level with her, she is so condescending\
      \ and toxic in the way she responds to you. This happened at least twice, where\
      \ I wouldn't just agree with her and she would tear the MC down for it, and\
      \ there is no change in behavior between the 1st instance and the 2nd. And after\
      \ each occurrence, she acts like we didn't just have a negative interaction\
      \ and proceeds to be super friendly. No apology, no acknowledgement of the argument.\
      \ It's like they never happened. But to top it off, she storms away every time\
      \ the conversation doesn't go her way. And get this, if you choose to go to\
      \ the sand dunes for your first location, telling her that she's saying such\
      \ sanctimonious bullsh*t launches her into a rage and she says \"well at least\
      \ I don't go around insulting people who are trying to do good!!\" AS IF SHE\
      \ DOESN'T GO FOR YOUR THROAT FIRST AND BERATES YOU HARD OUTSIDE OF CHOOSING\
      \ THE SAND DUNES AS YOUR FIRST LOCATION, JUST BECAUSE YOU OFFER A DIFFERENT\
      \ PERSPECTIVE. My god, I've never seen a story lack continuity so badly. It\
      \ made me want to completely stop interacting with the character, and in my\
      \ later replays to explore other routes, I had to pick another race even though\
      \ the Wispies were my favorite because I couldn't stand to have such a huge\
      \ b*tch in the group. Her outbursts initially make sense because the Wispies\
      \ are supposed to be very emotional by nature, but the problem is that there's\
      \ no aftermath to them. [/spoiler]\n\nThe fact that you can't confront your\
      \ companions about their terrible behavior or stand up for yourself without\
      \ being penalized is just so annoying. \n    [*]The lack of continuity is so\
      \ detrimental to the story.\n[/list]\n\nWhile I can't say this story is good,\
      \ I won't say no to trying out another one from this author if they put out\
      \ another text-based game in the future. Each piece is a learning opportunity,\
      \ and I'm sure the author can improve a lot from this experience. I can see\
      \ the potential, and I believe this could've been very different after more\
      \ rounds of editing and revising."
