Quite the epic proposition here.\n\n   139 tracks - yes, you heard me, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-NINE TRACKS - with the series' usual fair variety of moods, tending mostly towards orchestral-style/fantasy-themed compositions. \n\n   Evidently, the value being offered here is quite phenomenal. About the only other way you could get so much high-quality instrumental music for cheap (or rather, free) is to pirate it. You're not one of those filthy pirates, are you? Of course you're not... \n\n   Four bucks, you f*ck. If you already own the game, you have precious little excuse. Even if you don't normally listen to instrumental music, maybe it's time you started. Miley f*cking Cyrus is rich enough, already. The good people behind this product could put your money to much, much better use I suspect. (It won't go straight up their nose, for starters.)\n\n   Verdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1584019442,"timestamp_updated":1584019834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580446779727935791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZC85/ACeOPP9wE="}
