    review: "So I grabbed the Hexcells bundle during a steam sale and have to say,\
      \ I enjoyed the games as a veteran fan of logic puzzle games like sudoku and\
      \ picross, and I definitely enjoyed the series. \n\nThe game is basically picross\
      \ meets minesweeper; almost every level has a logical progression that, given\
      \ enough time, would allow anyone who wants to learn said logic will allow you\
      \ to pick the lock and get through the stage with no mistakes (without gambling.)\
      \  This is exactly what I am looking for in a puzzle series; a slow upticking\
      \ in difficulty that gently drags you into the game but doesn't frustrate you\
      \ until close to the end.  \n\nOf course, there is some problems; minor ones,\
      \ but they are still there.  Despite being like Picross, there is no note function\
      \ or lock that allows you to say \"I think this is a blue hex (equivalent of\
      \ a bomb in minesweeper) and this other square is a hint hex (which you left\
      \ click to uncover to see how many surrounding hexes are supposed to be blue)\"\
      \ or to prevent you from accidentally clicking a hex incorrectly.   That is\
      \ mostly all I have against the game, so I would say a good series at a good\
      \ price!"
