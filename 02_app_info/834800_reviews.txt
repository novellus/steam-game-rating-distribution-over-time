Keyword being \"potential\". Sadly that potential is squandered by a mixture of the town building and tower defense aspects being too fussy about building placements, especially farms (probably why the original ActRaiser stuck to both using larger grid units and keeping all buildings the same size on the grid), slightly annoying resource management (until you learn to prioritize chopping down all the forests first), and various design flaws (such as a very tight and unforgiving Enemy Wave timer that gave me very little time to keep up, conquered Enemy Lairs still spawning enemies, and the fact you can sidestep the timer altogether by exiting the lair or returning to the sky.).\n\nI like that combat is now a part of sealing lairs too, however, said combat is also in need of polish as most enemies and bosses have very lackluster movement and attack patterns, can easily be baited into AI loops (King of Floods in particular), and can be tanked and defeated with brute force mid to late game.\n\nThe achievements are pretty basic, and except for 4 of them, are obtained simply by completing the game. I would've liked an achievement for finding all the hidden Weather Mana upgrades since it's possible to miss those.\n\nThis is definitely a labor of love, one I wish to see thrive, but also a diamond in the rough. And while it's not nearly as polished as the game that inspired it, it's definitely worth the asking price in my opinion. I'd love to see the ACE team revisit this game and give it the much needed polish it deserves, along with hopefully a sequel that learns from this review.","timestamp_created":1609020195,"timestamp_updated":1609021049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ipnI0PYCdafEvQI="}
