It is useful but very situational. Listening Device item and the LAW rocket launcher are also useful (and you have to equip them in the loadout before the game) but again nothing to pay separately for. All of this coupled with a mostly empty multiplayer gives little reason to buy it. All of these should have been part of the base game. This DLC is part of the Rockstar Pass so you could get it there with the rest of the DLCs.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, after installing it, you have to start the game go to 'Store' in the main menu and redeem the code there.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1603887273,"timestamp_updated":1603887289,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596412539482116699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qrrIt/UCfb3QqgI="}
