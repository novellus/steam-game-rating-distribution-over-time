There are really only two interactions. You have a laser pointer which you can use to point at things (and get some factoids on those objects which are interactive) and you have a camera to take selfies or take low quality photos of objects around, including marine life & vegetation.\n\nRoom-scale is required to start the experience. You have to reach the start button. That's the only time you'll use your room-scale. I'm not kidding. They actually thought that was a good idea.\n\nSo most of the experience is just scripted events where a narrator will tell you about global warming and the effect of the that on this particular oceanic life. It was all stuff that I was already aware of, but it is illustrated here with a look at present conditions as well as the possible near future impact on oceanic life. \n\nThe visuals are mediocre, not great like in theBlu. However, unlike other games with this level of graphics, you can't swim around or interact with items in a meaningful or creative way. In the end, this feels more like it should have been a free to play title and then we could have forgiven its limitations. I'm just not sure I got my $2.99 USD (50% Steam sale) value from this experience.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I think this would be good for kids to learn about global warming in a approachable manner and I do recommend this app for that purpose, especially if you happen to have a LAN with several VR headsets and PCs capable of running VR just lying around your house (don't forget to buy a copy for each machine!)[/b]","timestamp_created":1569905433,"timestamp_updated":1569905792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546385705471038818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwKrrwu0Cdo+e0wE="}
