    short_description: Rocket Golf is a game that brings a new dimension to the traditional
      game of golf. Choose a launcher instead of a club. Pull a trigger instead of
      taking a swing. Through the game we take you from classic courses to environments
      you never imagined playing golf within. Thanks for coming!

    review: "Music:  7/10 needs a setting to lower it.\n\nControls: A little undeveloped\
      \ at the moment but once you get a hang of it you will understand. A better\
      \ tutorial is needed at the start of the game. And a crosshair should be implemented\
      \ as its a game where you need to aim at the ball.\n\nGameplay: Can\u2019t give\
      \ a rating really about this it depends if you like the concept of the game\
      \ or not but I enjoyed it :).\n\nAudience: Young and mature\n\nGraphics: Good\
      \ for the money you pay. Similar to a website game but not really.\n\nPrice/Quality:\
      \ Not really worth the price at the moment due to some small fixes and the game\
      \ needs some more development in my opinion. Buy the game when its on sale on\
      \ steam.\n\nBugs: Cursor is shown all the time when moving around which is really\
      \ annoying. Instead, a crosshair should be implemented. for easier aiming.\n\
      \nRequirements: Low-end PC\n\nDifficulty: Kind of hard if you haven\u2019t learned\
      \ where and how to aim to make the ball go the direction you want to.\n\nGame\
      \ time/length: Endless, play until you get bored.\n\nPros/Cons: I will list\
      \ that down below.\n\nImprovement: When you put the ball into the sockets you\
      \ should be able to automatically teleport to the next socket. Or else you will\
      \ get lost and don\u2019t find where the next socket especially on \u201CMAP\
      \ 3\u201D. Tutorials should be better implemented in the start instead of some\
      \ small screens. Its easy to miss and hard to understand but otherwise the game\
      \ is actually quite enjoyable but I wish there would be a multiplayer mode where\
      \ you can play golf and maybe even be able to \u201Cshoot your friend\u201D\
      ? to joke around as I feel it fits in good with the pistol that you use to launch\
      \ the golf ball. A crosshair must be implemented as its a game where you need\
      \ to aim at the ball.\nI like the concept of having those pictures of how the\
      \ way looks to get to the socket. But it should be nice if it got implemented\
      \ to all maps.\n\nOverall: Buy the game on sale, some development is needed.\
      \ But the game is still enjoyable and fun to play. Has a good potential once\
      \ its fixed!\n"
