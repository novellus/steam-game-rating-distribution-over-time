{"1419350":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Outbreak: Endless Nightmares","steam_appid":1419350,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Lydia's nightmares continue as she faces her greatest fears in this co-op semi-procedurally generated survival horror roguelike. Immediately following the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, she and her fellow survivors find themselves trapped in a dilapidated school-turned-hospital during the outbreak. But they soon discover something worse than the undead is after them as they begin to experience hallucinations and find themselves trapped in an endless loop of horror. They'll need to work together to understand the nature of this anomaly and ultimately find a way to free themselves, or be trapped forever.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOutbreak: Endless Nightmares twists the series' survival horror gameplay by mixing it with elements of roguelike gameplay. You'll need to explore, hunt for supplies, uncover clues and fight your way through each anomaly - consisting of semi-procedurally generated instances where both the environment, and the undead, are out to kill you. Death cannot save you, as you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital, which acts as your hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character and give you a breather before you venture back into the anomaly. As you play, you'll uncover journals left throughout time that may just shed more light on the outbreak, and ultimately help you find refuge. Every time you die, you'll awake trapped in this nexus.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOutbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple characters, each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more. Each time you venture into the anomaly, it will change and become more difficult as you grow in power. You'll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items and other supplies you'll bring into the anomaly. If you're lucky, you may find storage caches which give you access to your expanded inventory, and will offer an opportunity to restock. But it's all on you to search your environment for supplies. If you run out... your fate is sealed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLydia's nightmares are just beginning. Experience her endless nightmares in mid-2021.","about_the_game":"Lydia's nightmares continue as she faces her greatest fears in this co-op semi-procedurally generated survival horror roguelike.
