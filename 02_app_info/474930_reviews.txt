While I still personally don't like the pack as much as the others- it certainly works a lot better once you can turn off the white cards. \n\nHonestly this DLC makes me wish there was a way to turn OFF cards. On the one hand a lot of the black cards are rather interesting and funny in their own right... but if you (let alone the people you are playing with) don't know who the streamers are the white cards just massive wastes of time. I get a few of these black cards? Awesome. Who doesn't like a glorious beard! I get a white card that has some random numbers and letters on it? Worthless.\n\nMy point is even if you know these streamers you may want to reconsider buying this DLC. Even if you know them doesn't mean others will join you in that. For me, I got this when I bought the launch DLC pack so I couldn't exactly skip it. But now that I worked out exactly what it is I don't put it on during games.","timestamp_created":1470569524,"timestamp_updated":1472951822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw66Sx+dYCcvq4Xg=="}
