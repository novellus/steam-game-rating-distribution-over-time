      \ find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal\
      \ to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your\
      \ workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they\u2019ve ever\

      \ and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world\
      \ order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high\
      \ walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all\
      \ else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that\
      \ matters is the future.<br><br>The Euphorians aren\u2019t alone. Outside the\
      \ city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand\u2014they have the\
      \ memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a\
      \ society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.<br><br>There\
      \ is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies\
      \ the hidden city of Subterran, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries.\
      \ By keeping their workers in the dark, they\u2019ve patched together a network\
      \ of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Object of the Game</h2><br>In Euphoria, you lead a team of\
      \ workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world.\
      \ You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct\
      \ markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.<br><br>Euphoria\
      \ is a worker-placement game where dice are your workers. The number on each\
      \ die represents a worker\u2019s knowledge\u2013that is, their level of awareness\
      \ that they\u2019re in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses\
      \ and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your\
      \ workers gets too high, one of them might desert you.<br><br>You also have\
      \ 2 elite recruit cards at your disposal. One has pledged allegiance to you,\
      \ but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit\
      \ by reaching certain milestones in the game\u2026or by letting other players\
      \ unwittingly reach those milestones for you.<br><br>Your path to victory is\
      \ paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and\
      \ the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination\
      \ is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing\
      \ markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players,\
      \ changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also\
      \ focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are\
      \ extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these\
      \ artifacts\u2014especially matching pairs\u2014and are willing to give you\
      \ tracts of land in exchange for them.<br><br>Three distinct societies, each\
      \ of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice\
      \ to build a better dystopia?"
