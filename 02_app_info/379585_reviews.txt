The instructions dont work - If you have orbx Northern CA then dont buy! looking forward to this and instead got junkware -\n\nUpdate: this is Cielosim palo alto airport that from the screens looks good. It doesnt appear to be compatible with ORBX northern california. It is FSX and people are jumping ship for other sims but I can say it does not work well with orbx. \n\nDoveetail support answered my request for support by closing the ticket after never (NEVER) sending me any suggestions on how to fix. That really makes me want to skip flight sim world. If this is how you treat paying customers you will shorlty find yourself economically hurt. You can do better dovetail.","timestamp_created":1493260037,"timestamp_updated":1498577433,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mp6L9dwCdqbddw=="}
