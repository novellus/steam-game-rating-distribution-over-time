[b]no turn limit, but certain mechanics activate after a few turns[/b], such as bombs or nightcaps that put nearby yuso to sleep.\n\nthe [b]100 levels[/b] are mostly on the easy side and don't involve too many steps, but [b]unlimited undo[/b] is available to reduce tedium and repeating the same thing over and over. puzzles are sorted into packs of 10, they unlock as you make progress, but every level within is available to try immediately.\n\nthe graphics are cute and the audio isn't as bad as I expected, but there's annoying gibberish during dialog and the text is full of grammatical mistakes as well. separate volume settings, a bunch of languages and windowed mode are all here, along with proper level selection and level numbers, don't need anything else for such a simple affair.\n\noverall, it's a decent package, good for all ages, [b]takes about 3 hours[/b], but definitely overpriced, so wait for a sale. and don't bother if you care about achievements, some of them are bugged.","timestamp_created":1609041516,"timestamp_updated":1609041516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613110482692718506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qKW0fYCe7HPvQI="}
