Scroll bar hasn't even been changed from the default unity scroll bar.\n-Sliding puzzle should let the user place piece even if the last piece has not finished its animation. It's not fun to have to wait for every sliding animation to complete before sliding the next piece.\n-When doing a 2 x 2 sliding puzzle, it can happen that all pieces are already in the right spot. Clicking trigger display of \"complete\" text, but there should be a validation to be sure they are well shuffled.\n-When doing a puzzle and clicking \"game menu\", it goes back to the menu, but the scroll bar position has not been saved and you need to scroll all the way up to where you where to continue browsing different image.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThere is about 144 stock photos to play with in 3 different modes: jigsaw puzzle pieces where all pieces are there at the start, jigsaw puzzle pieces where 1 piece is shown at a time with the reference image in alpha on the board and a sliding rectangle pieces puzzle.\n\t\nI think this game is more like a proof of concept of a puzzle game and need much more polishing to be entertaining and fun. I don't recommend this game.\n\nI realised that I already review another puzzle from the same creator but under another name: \"Halloween Puzzles\" released on 6 Nov 2018 under the developer and publisher \"Halloween Puzzles\". I can say that they are the same game. Summer has better images though. Both are not fun enough to want to play them at the moment for more than a few minutes. I would not currently recommend.\n","timestamp_created":1588296703,"timestamp_updated":1588296703,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wYv35vECecXWhAI="}
