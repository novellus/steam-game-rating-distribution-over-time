      \ that visited their loved ones or which attended funerals died. However, the\
      \ police can\u2019t find any bodies. The cemetery is closed down now and the\
      \ case is closed too because there\u2019s no real way to figure out what happened\
      \ and finally solve this rather intriguing and challenging case. <br />\r\n\
      The problem is that more and more people in town are missing and the remaining\
      \ residents are scared that the body count increases and they may very well\
      \ be next. <br />\r\nYou are play the role of Alex, who has a partner named\
      \ Lana. Lana had a very good life until now, but this shift in the city affected\
      \ her a lot more than ever before. Her sister is missing, so she needs to do\
      \ everything in her power to figure out a good approach and finally get to the\
