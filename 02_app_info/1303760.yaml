    review: "While the game is not straight up bad, it is not especially good either.\
      \ A bit wonky at times, sure, but for a first published game it is not too bad.\
      \ The major issue is lack of content. As of writing, there are three levels\
      \ in the game, each only taking about 5 minutes to beat. After I completed the\
      \ third (and last) level, i ended up in what i can only presume was a testing\
      \ level, with a springboard that i did not find in the actual game. \n\nI think\
      \ a month or two could have been spent on finishing up properly,  such as implementing\
      \ some more mechanics , or at the very least adding more levels. Right now you\
      \ could finish the game and refund it, as it takes nowhere near two hours. I\
      \ won't do that, as it is visually pleasing and I personally like the music\
      \ a lot and see some potential in this game."
