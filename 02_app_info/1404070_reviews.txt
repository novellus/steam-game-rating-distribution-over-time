There's even [spoiler]a way to die without losing progress[/spoiler].\n\nExploring levels, figuring how to advance and wondering what happens next brings joy, and everything is cleverly designed so that \"10 seconds\" timer doesn't stand on the way of exploration and doesn't force to speedrun everything without properly examining locations.\n\nThese days with so many games to play it's hard to find time to complete something long, and that turns short length into advantage, since it's an easy way to finally get that \"I finally completed another game\" feeling.","timestamp_created":1606713702,"timestamp_updated":1606713702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw567mi/YCeezRtQI="}
