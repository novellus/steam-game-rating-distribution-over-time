It is almost like the Destroy All Humans! game, causing havoc and destroying everything in sight in open world areas. The downside is clunky controls, flying, and aim. I never got past Witch's House 3 level which is incredibly difficult, but aside from that the game is fun to play.","timestamp_created":1579834550,"timestamp_updated":1579834550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw78Te6u8CfZrW7QE="}
