Not sold as \"Collector's Edition\" or even a Standard one. and given its age... it's not going to be fixed. it's an As-Is and in that state, i can't in good conscious give it a recommendation. it's rare that i'm not ambivalent about the yes/no rating but there you go.","timestamp_created":1608967591,"timestamp_updated":1608967591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xaL8zvYCe4anvQI="}
