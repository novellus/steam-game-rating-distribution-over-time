    review: "Skeleton Boomerang is, for one, an extremely underrated game that deserves\
      \ a lot more attention. Here are my thoughts:\n\nThis game is simple in design\
      \ but yet has a charm to it that makes it fun and enjoyable to play. The backgrounds\
      \ for the stages are minimalistic in a good way, allowing for you to focus in\
      \ on the character you're playing as, Hunter. The story is simple, because this\
      \ game doesn't need much of an explanation for why you're doing what you're\
      \ doing. It just wants to put you into a little world to explore and enjoy all\
      \ the mechanics that the levels have to offer. And there are a lot of fun mechanics\
      \ to discover, especially in Hard Mode, which basically makes the game an entirely\
      \ new experience as it keeps the overall level setup, but adds new things to\
      \ make parkouring more difficult. I would say Hard Mode is basically as hard\
      \ as an average player playing Cuphead would be, but that's more or less \"\
      what did you expect it's CALLED Hard Mode\". Yes, at times there are levels\
      \ and mechanics specific to Hard Mode that feel unfair due to randomness, but\
      \ otherwise it's a fun challenge.\n\nThe normal mode however is extremely fun\
      \ for any casual gamer to play. The boomerang physics are fun to play around\
      \ with, and is really THE thing that makes this game unique. It's a platformer,\
      \ yes, but the addition of combo-ing with your boomerang and doing so by avoiding\
      \ your own weapon is both a challenge but fun. The upgrades you get are balanced\
      \ enough that you can really choose your favorite and stick to it. Other than\
      \ the final upgrade for the boomerangs (which is objectively the best one due\
      \ to what it is), the boomerangs you get until that point have equal upsides\
      \ and downsides to them.\n\nAnd the music, well, it's an absolute banger of\
      \ a soundtrack. I would play this game just to enjoy that alone. \nWith the\
      \ new Full Screen (ReVamped) update, the backgrounds have more detail to them,\
      \ without losing their simple-in-design charm. Even small things like all the\
      \ dialogue through the signposts spread throughout the game are clever and funny.\
      \ There are some bugs here and there due to the update, but I know that these\
      \ will be fixed with time. The addition of color palettes for Hunter is a great\
      \ way to reward the player and basically doubles the amount of time you'll spend\
      \ playing the game.\nFor an indie game like this, it deserves a lot of credit.\
      \ It's fun and challenging, as well as rewarding. \n"
