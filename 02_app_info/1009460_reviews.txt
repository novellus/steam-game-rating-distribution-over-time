[b]The writing is weird[/b], but I'm not even sure that's the right word to use here. For example, the MC, Kaito sometimes contradicts himself rather quickly after a statement, there are instances when the dialogue feels uninspired and boring. During Koharu's route, the last showdown feels extremely weak, it's almost like the writers didn't exactly knew how they wanted to resolve the situation. It's also [b]light on action[/b], not what you'd expect from a story with a spy as its main character, so that might be a big letdown to some. Not to say there aren't any actions scenes at all, and they're not bad, but you get my point. It also [b]pulls its punches quite a bit[/b]. Most of the more serious issues are resolved conveniently and quickly, so there isn't much tension, which makes it a bit less interesting. [b]The characters themselves are rather bland[/b] too. It's not terrible or anything and I wouldn't say they lack charm, but they're certainly not very memorable either. Likeable, yes, memorable, no. [b]Some of the H-scenes are oddly timed and most of them are less than mediocre[/b].\n\nNow, for the [b]positives[/b]. I never expected this, but actually, the [b]romance is quite strong[/b] in pretty much every route. Not mushy or overly dramatic, they're just nice, pure and wholesome, like they should be. The [b]endings are very satisfying and rewarding[/b], it made me feel like it was worth playing every route. The [b]music is just great. I found myself just listening to the music without doing anything quite a few times, so it's worth mentioning. [b]Alongside the art[/b], which is not amongst the best I've seen, but it does have a certain charm, it kinda reminds me a few of those mid-late 2000's typical rom-com anime art style and the actualy character designs definitely appeal to me. While [b]the writing could be a bit better, but the story still does a decent enough job[/b] that I always want to know more and the last route does a good enough job at answering most questions I was personally curious about. While the major conflicts resolutions are usually pretty safe, personally I was fine with them because it always made sense (except the very last one) and it still felt satisfying, at least to me.\n\nIf I want to sum it up, the concept is very interesting, but it lacks impact because of how safe it plays. With that said, it's still satisfying with suprisingly strong romance and I'd say, it's worth a read if your current VN queue is empty.","timestamp_created":1609084688,"timestamp_updated":1609084819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ447q70vYCfPPlvQI="}
