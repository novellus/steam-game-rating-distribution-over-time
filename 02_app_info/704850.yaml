      class="bb_tag"><strong>Thief Simulator</strong></h2><br>Become the real thief.
      Steal in free roam sandbox neighborhoods. Observe your target and gather information
      that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured
      houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipment and learn new thief tricks. Sell
      stolen goods to the passers. Do anything that a real thief does!<br><br><img

      /><br>A good thief always observes his target. What's inside? Who lives there?
      What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it
      have nosy neighbours. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the
      best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy
      with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Be-Quick.gif?t=1609504328"
      /><br>The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in
      the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When
      it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find
      tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that
      you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave
      it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack
      with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just
      to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police
      attention to you!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Flashlight.gif?t=1609504328"
      /><br>A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability
      of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the flashlight at night to highlight
      all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be.<br><br><img

      /><br>Disassemble a stolen car and sell parts on the internet. Prepare phones
      and tablets before selling them in a pawn shop by removing their security. <br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Useful_Items.gif?t=1609504328"
      /><br>Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking
      or hacking. Key near a window or purchase receipts in trash bins. All those
      things can make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary
      time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe
      they aren't?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Be_Careful.gif?t=1609504328"
      /><br>Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch
      you in the act, they will call the police. In this case hide and wait till they
      stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as
      possible.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Check out more great games published by
