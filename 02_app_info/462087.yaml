    review: You're not just getting battle themes. You're getting a library that'll
      fit in an entire game. There are themes good for towns, paths, dungeons, and
      scenes in this pack, accompanied by plenty of good battle music. And the best
      part is that they're all remarkably good. This is worth your twelve bucks...
      just make sure you actually have the Steam version of RPGM VX Ace and not the
      RPG Maker Web version so you don't go through the hell I brought upon myself
      over the past two days...
