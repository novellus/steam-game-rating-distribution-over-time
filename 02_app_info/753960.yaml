    review: "The sound is horrible; sounds like one of those Amnesia Custom Maps people\
      \ made for My Little Pony and such. \nThe game is too slow, you could probably\
      \ power through this game if it had a faster paste. But instead you just stand\
      \ still and wait for the attacks to come, which sometimes don't even work.\n\
      There's a guy that throws you spears and you are supposed to block those spears\
      \ with the sword that they gave you, but sometimes you can't even block the\
      \ spears just because.\n\nSo I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe in a long time they\
      \ can actually fix these issues and I have hopes that they do. But for now,\
      \ it really fits with the Unity logo."
