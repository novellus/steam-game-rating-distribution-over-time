    review: "I remember seeing this on Greenlight years ago and thinking it looked\
      \ interesting. Today I gave it a try and... ooh boi.\n\nWhere do I begin? How\
      \ about the sound design, it's completely borked. Sounds are horribly unbalanced,\
      \ with the first level having constant loud 'Pew Pew' sounds. \nThe touted voice\
      \ acting is a joke, just a couple of muffled voices speaking in broken english.\
      \ Guys. There's a site called 'Fiverr', you can get cheap professional sounding\
      \ voice actors from there for cheap.\n|Controls\nThe Controls cannot be rebound\
      \ to other keys. To turn on the flashlight you press 'T'. Not 'F'. T!? Who the\
      \ fuck thinks to use T for a flashlight, this is a simple convention that was\
      \ established in Half Life over 20 years ago, how do you mess that up? And what's\
      \ the point of having an optional flashlight? Everything is fuccin dark, why\
      \ not just have it on by default? Or properly light your levels, that would\
      \ help!\nWhat F [i]does[/i] do is swap weapons you can pick up. But it doesn't\
      \ do it automatically, no! You have to hold F and walk into the weapon, an half\
      \ the time it didn't bloody work anyway.\nPlayer moves slow and it feels like\
      \ you're battling the heavy physics of the character, you feel like you're battling\
      \ the game for control of that character and that ain't fun.\n|Interface\nThe\
      \ ammo counter for some guns never count down to zero. Sometimes the game will\
      \ tell me theres a bullet in the magazine yet never fire. \nActually, when I\
      \ booted this up for the first time, my cursor was out of sync with the menu,\
      \ so I had to click to the right of a button to use it. A reset actually fixed\
      \ this, but it was a dire first impression.\n|Experience\nMost of the weapons\
      \ feel the same. The aforementioned poor sound design makes nothing stand out.\
      \ The only weapons worth a damn are the rapid fire weapons.\nWhen you reset\
      \ a level, your weapons get swapped out for no reason, have fun messing around\
      \ trying to figure out what your current inventory does.\nThe enemies are all\
      \ abstract cube shapes but they do nothing other than waddle around while you\
      \ shoot them\nSometimes the frame rate drops for no reason, it's really distracting.\n\
      |Level Design\nIt's all corridors. It's sooooo dull. When I saw the trailer\
      \ to this I thought it would be like an arena shooter, but nope. Just walking\
      \ around trying to figure out where to go while nondescript enemies shoot at\
      \ you.\n\n|Verdict\nIt's bad, buy something else"
