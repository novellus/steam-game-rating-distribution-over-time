    about_the_game: Your infiltration team has been tasked with completing a series
      of missions to stop an army of lunar-bots from crashing the moon into our Earth!
      The field operative will wield the VR headset, sneaking through each lunar-outpost
      avoiding the mechanical guards. In this, they will be assisted by their team
      of hackers, who will guide the field operative and <strong>use their smartphones</strong>
      to help clear obstacles and disrupt the enemy. So gather a group of friends,
      strap on your VR headset and commence &quot;Operation Armstrong&quot;!<br><br><img

      /><br><br>This Assymetric-VR-Stealth-Party game features the following:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>A series of hand crafted interactable VR environments<br></li><li>Phone

      /><br><br>We made the game with the intention of providing a fun way for those
      spectating a VR user to join in on the action instead of just waiting for their
      turn. Phone users simply log in to a current game through their browser and
      can immediately start assisting their headset wielding buddy. Teamwork and communication
      will be key which can lead to some hilarious and tense moments. Players can
      drop in and out of the game at any time since responsibilities are dynamically
      shared equally across all phone users. It's an all round, high energy, inclusive
      group activity.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1145490/extras/LevelCreation.gif?t=1600153684"
