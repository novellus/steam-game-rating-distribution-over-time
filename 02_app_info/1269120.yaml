    review: "Not their best work, unfortunately. If you buy the bundle, you get two\
      \ episodes (Episode 0 is a sort of set up teaser that introduces the major characters\
      \ and comes free with Episode 1) for about 5 bucks CAD. But...it's hard to justify\
      \ even the small price for the amount of content. I have about an hour and a\
      \ half played, and this was exploring [b]every[/b] option. There are a total\
      \ of three H scenes, which are buried in Episode 2. One is only accessible if\
      \ you picked a certain character to go after in Episode 0 and 1 (Britt) and\
      \ two are basically on the way to unavoidable game overs. All three scenes are\
      \ single, static images with text descriptions of the action. They are not voiced.\n\
      \nThere are also so very...odd errors. Grammar mistakes here and there, but\
      \ you have an option to go after a friend to save them, forsaking the other.\
      \ I've had it in later episodes (all launched from the same game, mind you)\
      \ where the forsaken friend is there with the group, and even has lines, as\
      \ if nothing happened. It was hilarious, because it made it seem like they were\
      \ talking [i]about themselves[/i] being gone. \n\nI would have liked to have\
      \ seen far more H content, especially since it's not exactly anything special\
      \ (just a single image of content). There are sexual overtones in the episodes,\
      \ but nothing goes to XXX land until Episode 2, and it just feels like a slog\
      \ to go through the entire game to get to some rather unrewarding scenes.\n\n\
      I'm not going to return it, but I also wouldn't buy it unless it was on sale.\
      \ Or maybe until there's much more, and much more decent, content.\n\nEDIT:\
      \ Seems there's another H scene, but getting to it is kinda convoluted. Also,\
      \ going hard into the Amber route results in a hard crash."
