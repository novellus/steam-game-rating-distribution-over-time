    review: "Earth Muncher is a quick and easy puzzle game to pick up; its... *ahem*\
      \ bite sized levels and quick startup time make it ideal for a quick 10 to 15\
      \ minute round of gaming, perfect for anyone crunched for time.\n\nCute sound\
      \ effects, paired with some cute graphics make for an overall enjoyable aesthetic.\
      \ The idea of limited moves makes planning crucial and execution harder with\
      \ every level, but never TOO difficult. Pacing of new game elements make it\
      \ so the game stays fresh, but never overwhelming. \n\nBravo!"
