      \ class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play</h2></strong><br><br>Table tennis, also known\
      \ as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball\
      \ back and forth across a table using small bats. The game takes place on a\
      \ hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally\
      \ as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time\
      \ on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite\
      \ side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball\
      \ within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball\
      \ alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter\
      \ a great advantage.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Notes for Tracker Users</h2></strong><br><br>If\
      \ you are a user using Tracker, pay attention to this article.<br><br>The basic\
      \ settings in PingPong Kings VR are two controllers, the left controller means\
      \ a ball for a serve, and the right controller means a racket.<br><br>If you\
      \ want to use the tracker that is attached to the racket, turn off one of the\
      \ controllers and then connect the tracker. After that, the tracker automatically\
      \ means right racket.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/802310/extras/\uD06C\

    review: it is an ok game but physics dont work well. for example i hit the ball
      when it was close to me and insted of going forward, it goes up or doesnt move
      at all. secondly sometimes the table doesnt act solid as the ball goes straight
      through. on the other hand it is quite fun and enjoyable to play and really
      feels like real life.
