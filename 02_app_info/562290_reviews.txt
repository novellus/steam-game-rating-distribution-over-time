Reducing the number of characters would have greatly simplified the game. Overall, the game is extremely buggy plus you will never finish it because after a certain progress through levels, the game just starts crashing. You'll never go beyond that point. This game can be resurrected if the developer gets back on it and works on some of the feedback from players. But the developer has been absent there from the start.\n\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME! DON'T EVEN PLAY IT FOR FREE! It will give you a headache.","timestamp_created":1562027537,"timestamp_updated":1562027615,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515570938587188721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sbyG2OsCfvCnygE="}
