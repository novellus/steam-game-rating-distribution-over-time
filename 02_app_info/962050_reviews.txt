After playing all of the well designed and perfectly crafted levels at least 10 times I feel better than ever. Not only has this game cured my depression and broken a leg, but it has also opened a light into my life. Through playing this game I feel that, as the name says, I have become a smart bird. My GPA has risen from a 2.5 to an astonishing 4.0, thatâ€™s how good this game is. The soundtrack of this game was composed by a master, a pure musical genius, when you enter each level your ears get assaulted with the most wonderful sounds known to man. There may not be a settings menu but this masterpiece has no need for such simple things. The game runs at a smooth 1,000 FPS at an 8k resolution with each puzzle looking like the real world, but better. However, the one problem that I have with this game is the difficulty, The game starts out easy but like no other game before this masterpiece, it gets harder. At around the 9 level mark, the game becomes dark-souls esque with each puzzle acting like a major boss. The sound effects are incredible in this game with each puzzle piece finding its soul mate my ears have an orgasm and I fill my pants. This is a must by for anyone who can afford the high price of two American dollars, it may be expensive but it is a master piece that is a must buy.","timestamp_created":1605660423,"timestamp_updated":1605660423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tba07PUCcrWErwI="}
