The graphics are good for a game that is 8 years old. Unfortunately the controls were a mess. Mouse control was almost non existant, trying to turn my ship had me rolling the mouse across the desk multiple times, keyboard binding is very unintuitive and difficult to really understand. I tried using my Logitech Dual Action controller but the game did not recognize that there are two joysticks. \n\nI would not recomend this game to anyone.","timestamp_created":1546398908,"timestamp_updated":1546398908,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5tejhugCdKqctwE="}
