    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Create a battle mech!</h2><br>Do you think
      about a career in the video game industry as a 3D Artist and happen to like
      Battle Mechs? Then this tutorial might be perfect for you. Follow along as this
      comprehensive 15 hour+ long course as we model, unwrap, bake and texture a battle
      mech to current video game standards. Every step is documented without fast
      forwarding. At the end of the free part you have the option to learn even more
      with the extended edition in which we go over 10 more triple A quality PBR textures.<h2
      class="bb_tag">3Ds Max - Modeling</h2>The modeling part covers the scene setup
      followed by the low and high-poly modeling in which we make use of advanced
      actions, modifiers and tools to help us create the battle mech. After the modeling
      process we will jump straight into the UVW Editor and focus on the importance
      of an optimized UV-Layout to get the maximum out of our later texture.<h2 class="bb_tag">Substance
      Painter - Texturing</h2>In the Substance Painter part we will then bake our
      normal map as well as other important support maps. Right after that you will
      learn how to make an ultra realistic texture for our mech. Learn how to create
      our base layer materials and how to use procedural textures, masks and generators
      to form up the wear and tear on our mech resulting in a photo realistic appearance.
      You will also get to know the latest tools that Substance Painter currently
      has to offer. Add additonal normal map with curvature and AO information and
      learn how to add text as well as creating an almost infinite amount of different
      looks and styles by switching out our base layers.<h2 class="bb_tag">What are
      the requirements?</h2>It is recommended to follow the course with the same software
      we use throughout the tutorial: <br>3Ds Max 2017 (can be 2016 and 2015 too)
      and  Substance Painter 2 or the latest 2017 installement of Substance Painter.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Who is the target audience?</h2>This tutorial is aimed at beginners
      as well as intermediate. <br>I try to avoid heavy use of shortcuts as much as
      I can during the lesson so that you can see which actions I use.<h2 class="bb_tag">What
      do I get from this course?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>15 hours of fully documented
      and commented HD video content. <br></li><li>Game industry ready knowledge in
      modeling, unwrapping and texturing.<br></li><li>Essential reference images.<br></li><li>Final
      high-poly and low-poly mech for those that just want to follow the texturing
      part.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Instructor Biography</h2>Hi! I''m Tim - Senior

      game!<br>I started my 3D Artist career at Crytek before working at Ubisoft Toronto
