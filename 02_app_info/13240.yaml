    about_the_game: "Unreal Tournament is the original King of the Hill in the frag-or-be-fragged\
      \ multiplayer gaming world. As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal\
      \ Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its\
      \ pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics,\
      \ brutal edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that\
      \ gave gamers more than they ever expected.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li><strong>Novice Mode</strong> - This Botmatch competition is where new flak\
      \ fodder hit boot camp. The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots\
      \ in the game move slower and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those\
      \ new to first person shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born\
      \ and addiction begins... <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong>\
      \ - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse pad to wipe\
      \ away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move\
      \ like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their\
      \ standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Enhanced\
      \ Bot AI</strong> - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on\
      \ a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually\
      \ perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability\
      \ to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very\
      \ real. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Radio Chatter</strong> - Each of the\
      \ commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message\
      \ on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied\
      \ by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially\
      \ cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents' messages too (even if you're\
      \ playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too). <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>New\
      \ Command Line Options</strong> - For the hardcore server masters, this is the\
      \ dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want\
      \ to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! <br>\t\t\t\
      \t\t</li><li><strong>Improved User Interface</strong> - Unreal Tournament introduced\
      \ a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads\
      \ up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination,\
      \ and Assault), the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT\
      \ bombarding the player with excessive info. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>UBrowser</strong>\
      \ - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find\
      \ a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need\
      \ to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as one-two-frag.\
      \ By clicking on the &quot;Play Online&quot; button and then selecting a server\
      \ from the list, the game is on. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Spectator Cams</strong>\
      \ - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much\
      \ fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter a game and\
      \ hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even\
      \ cooler, the camera can be &quot;attached&quot; to one of the players in the\
      \ level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature\
      \ and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. <br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Jump Mode</strong> - Jump twice as high as normal.\
      \ It's sorta' like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these\
      \ boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.</li></ul>\xA9\
