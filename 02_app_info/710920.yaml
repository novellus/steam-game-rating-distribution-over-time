      /><br>From the dawn of creation, THE COUNCIL has maintained the Balance across
      existence.  Carrying out their orders are THE HORSEMEN, Nephilim (powerful beings
      spawned from the unnatural union of angels and demons) who have pledged themselves
      to the Council and been granted immense power.  However, this power came at
      a tragic cost: the Horsemen were ordered to use their newfound strength to wipe
      out the rest of their kind.  What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where
      the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim.<br><br><img

      /><br>Still reeling from the events on Eden, WAR and STRIFE have been given
      a new assignment -- LUCIFER, the enigmatic and deceptive demon king, has been
      plotting to upset the Balance by granting power to master demons throughout
      Hell.  War and Strife must hunt down these masters, gather information, and
      ultimately fight their way through a tangled, demonic conspiracy that threatens
      to forever upset the Balance and unravel all of creation.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/710920/extras/DS3_coop_628x183.gif?t=1603719407"
      /><br>DARKSIDERS: GENESIS is an action/adventure game that tears its way through
      hordes of demons, angels, and everything in-between on its way to Hell and back
      with guns blazing and swords swinging.  Genesis gives players their first look
