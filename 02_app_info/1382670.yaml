      \ in the world. He should have relied on his own strength to make more efforts\
      \ for peace in this world, but he has always used his hegemony to interfere\
      \ in other countries\u2019 internal affairs and continue to provoke countries.\
      \ Strife. The worst thing is that when the infectious disease arrived, he did\
      \ not take any preventive measures and allowed the infectious disease to rages,\
      \ posing a great threat to the health and safety of humans all over the world.\
      \ All this is due to the incumbent President Trump of country A, and he is very\
      \ likely to win this presidential election and continue to be re-elected. Some\
      \ peace-loving organizations from various countries could no longer bear this\
      \ politician who threatened world peace, so they joined forces and prepared\
      \ three plans to kill President Trump by flying fighter jets, and developed\
      \ three different attack routes to ensure Able to successfully kill the president.\
      \ The three routes are R country-Alaska-Seattle-Chicago-Washington; J country-Pearl\
      \ Harbor-Los Angeles-Houston-Washington; EU-Atlantic Ocean-New York-Washington.\
      \ Of course, the president will not sit still and intercept our attack at the\
      \ defense bases along the way. Only by successfully passing through all bases\
      \ can we successfully reach the city where the president is located and complete\
      \ the task of killing the president.<br />\r\nWith the implementation of the\
      \ plan, more and more peace organizations have joined the war, and more attack\
      \ routes are also being continuously formulated. Join us and depose this selfish\
      \ president!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow to play:<br />\r\nEach route has four levels,\
      \ and you need to pass through each level in turn to complete this line. After\
      \ completing one line, you can open the next line.<br />\r\nDrive fighter jets\
      \ to shoot enemy aircraft or enemies according to the requirements of different\
      \ levels. Only after completing one level can you just enter the next level,\

    review: "I've always wanted to find a flying combat shooting game, which is full\
      \ of yearning for the sky. The price of this game is really worth it. The take-off\
      \ of the game is like an aircraft carrier, and there is no problem with keyboard\
      \ operation. More of it is shooting scenes, which is not the kind of entry-level\
      \ flight. You can see Trump. It's playing with relatively degassing. It's realistic\
      \ and difficult to control it. Air combat shooting needs to get used to speed.\
      \ The main reason is that my VR glasses are too poor. It's very good to experience\
      \ it. Recommend!\uFFFC"
