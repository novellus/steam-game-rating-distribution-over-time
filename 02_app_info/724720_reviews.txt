You might look at this and think \"HOW THE FUCK IS A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE SLOW AS HELL CAR FUN?\" Well I'll tell you how. Lift-off oversteer. That's right. A front wheel drive with OVERSTEER. Not to mention a little bit of turbo lag. It's a perfect car with perfectly controllable countersteer. This is an absolute must-have DLC pack for this absolute must-have game. You will not have more fun than this (besides some of the obvious fun cars). 10/10","timestamp_created":1521181058,"timestamp_updated":1521181058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551208317279815674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvZzdluICf+XmmwE="}
