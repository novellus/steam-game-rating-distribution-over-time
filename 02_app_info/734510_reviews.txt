But for my part, I really love it, and is a great part of the game's quality.","timestamp_created":1609706033,"timestamp_updated":1609882024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhMec6vYCfumXwAI="}
