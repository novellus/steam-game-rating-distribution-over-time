    about_the_game: Revolution 60  is a deliberate mixture of two games, Heavy Rain
      and Mass Effect. Players will control Holiday, a trained assassin as she navigates
      the orbital weapons platform, N313. They will make the decisions that will make
      her mission succeed or fail. Players will make moral choices and live with the
      consequences. Will they side with Minuete, the rogue commander hellbent on completing
      her mission? Or with Amelia, the engineer determined to figure out what went
      wrong?
