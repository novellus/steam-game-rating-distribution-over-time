This is the next level in automation control and it is grand. You need a separate free (or not) virtual midi driver that you can find with a quick google search and then you're set. AND THEN YOU CAN ASSIGN EVERY DAMN KNOB OR MOVEMENT FROM THE MOTION CONTROLLERS TO ANY DIAL OR WHATEVER IN YOUR DAW. This is amazing, it takes a short time to learn and then you can modulate yo audio to movements or button presses from your motion controllers. The only reason that most music is not made this way is because people do not know that this exists. Well it does and it is marvellous. Big thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1569476114,"timestamp_updated":1569476114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Z6Etu0Cf5Xy0gE="}
