That being said the game isn't without it's flaws.  The AI is too easy.  I beat all 5 AI opponents in one hour.\n\nYou can put a ridiculous amount of spin on the ball, and the killer feature is the signature Appnori bullet time where you ram it down their throat just at the right moment.  If I'm gonna pick any tennis game to play casually it would probably be this one just for the bullet time feature.\nNow that I've beat the AI I still find myself coming back just to show off with spin and bullet time.\n\nIf you're not serious tennis player.. this game probably has the highest fun factor out of the 3 I own.  Virtual Sports is still the best overall due to the challenging AI and progression.\n\nThis game is still a buy.  price is a little high. $5.99 would be perfect but unfortunately these games never go on sale.","timestamp_created":1530419264,"timestamp_updated":1559770851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ468zllOsCdcvopAE="}
