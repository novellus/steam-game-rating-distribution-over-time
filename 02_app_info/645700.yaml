    review: 'If you are really and I mean [b]really[/b] desperate for World Witches
      stuff, buy it. If not, pass on it. Pass harrrd.


      The flight and the firing mechanics are janky as heck. And, the fighting is
      painfully anti-climactic.


      The only other redeeming feature is the sauna scene, but it doesn''t even include
      all of the girls, just 3. How could they mess that up. At least include all
      of them, so everyone could see their favorite girl once. Even then, it is such
      a cringe-inducing experience I don''t think it''d even be worth it.'
