    review: 'I 100% recommend this game. Its fun, challenging, lovely graphics and
      the story is good and amusing. Lots of comedy.


      Will you rage? Get mad? Annoyed? Wanna smash your head into a brick wall and
      forget about some of these rooms? Well of course but that''s part of the fun
      with this game!


      Chaotic approved!'
