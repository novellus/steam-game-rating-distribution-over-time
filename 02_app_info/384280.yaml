    review: "I might not want to recommend this to those hardcore types out there.\
      \ If you came to look for something that lives up to old school NES games like\
      \ Ninja Gaiden. This isn't it. It's much, much easier than that game is!\nSure,\
      \ it gets hard. But the difficulty of this game is how willing you are to keep\
      \ dying to get that coin surrounded by spikes. I mean sure. You need pixel perfect\
      \ movement to get through the later levels. And the reflexes of a fruit fly\
      \ to get past some enemies. But none of that matters when you respawn at a checkpoint\
      \ 5 jumps away. RN I collected all of the coins from the City level all the\
      \ way up to the Moon level. And in that span of 5 different worlds, I haven't\
      \ raged quit once! That's not what I expected from the store page! I expected\
      \ to have my  A S S handed to me. Not half-assed handed to me! I haven't even\
      \ broken a sweat yet!\n\nBut while all that I've said above leads you to believe\
      \ I don't like this game. Nope. You are wrong about that. I actually do like\
      \ this game. It's kinda like a harder kirby for me really. I'd let my 5 yr old\
      \ play this as a warm up before I beat him up in Slap City. If you are below\
      \ the ages of 5-11( which I estimate roughly half the people on steam are) I\
      \ thoroughly recommend this game. It's a great \"getting good at video games\"\
      \ game.\n And If you find yourself having a rough time getting through this\
      \ game, I recommend reading the subtitles to the cutscenes out loud, preferably\
      \ before bed. Your grammar teacher will love your for it.\n Thank me later.\
      \ :)"
