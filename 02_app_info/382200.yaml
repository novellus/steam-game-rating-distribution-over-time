    review: "I really wanted to give this module a good review. Unfortunately, I just\
      \ can't.\n\nI'd like to separate two things, the story and the module. The story\
      \ itself is pretty good, with rich lore and a fair amount of backstory pertaining\
      \ to the quest.  However, the [i]module[/i] is put together rather haphazardly.\
      \ \n\nWe've been trying to get this campaign off the ground for the last couple\
      \ of weeks. We started with the Adventures in Red Larch side quests to get us\
      \ leveled from 1-3 before the main adventure. Unfortunately, unless you know\
      \ the entire campaign as the GM, it's nigh on impossible to navigate the module\
      \ when your party makes a choice about where to go.\n\nFundamentally, it comes\
      \ down to poor linking and searchability. The module might tell you that your\
      \ players main choices are to investigate A, B, or C. However it doesn't link\
      \ to A, B, or C, and when you find the generic entry for those places it is\
      \ without context and often doesn't provide the information you need to continue\
      \ the adventure. The general excuse I see for this is that it's a \"player driven\"\
      \ investigation. But my experience is that the players get burned out very fast\
      \ without some level of direction. \n\nFurther, many of the NPCs are not built\
      \ correctly. Attack and Damage rolls don't function properly (can't target the\
      \ party) so the outcome of said rolls has to be manually reconciled. This module\
      \ simply does not provide the GM the tools needed to succeed.\n\nIt's a module\
      \ that require the GM to be intimately familiar with the story, which is scattered\
      \ throughout various chapters  and exceptionally hard to follow in any coherent\
      \ manner. We're one session into the main quest, and even after investing all\
      \ of this effort I think we're going to have to scrap it and start something\
      \ else. \n\nI cannot recommend this module in good conscience."
