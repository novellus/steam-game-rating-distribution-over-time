Accompanied by a young nun and a bard, it is up to you to rid the world of the demon lord and the conflicts between beast and half-human.\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\nLulu & Ennoi has a special gameplay. You play on maps divided into hexagons. Within the limit of available moves, it's up to you to complete the objective, discover the secrets of each chapter, and not die in front of the monsters. To help you, your companions will be able to put on outfits that increase the stats and you yourself accumulate points that allow you to inflict more damage.\n\nLulu & Ennoi can inflict a quick Game Over if you're not careful. The New Game+ is an integral part of the game because it is impossible to get to all the endings without a game over. In two hours and about ten adventures, I was able to complete all the game's achievements and secrets.\n\nThe narration of the game is not its strong point. The main interest of the adventure are the adult scenes. Thanks to the different costumes, the scenes are diversified. The CGs are very beautiful. Be careful however, for a reason that escapes me, you will have to unlock the uncensored version of the images yourself by killing  a secret monster.\n\nLulu & Ennoi offers a flat and boring gameplay. However, the pleasure of unlocking the outfits for the heroines and the quality of the adult scenes allow me to recommend it to you.\n\n[u]Highlights :[/u]\n\n+ the CGs are very nice\n+ I really like the design of the heroines.\n+ short and dense\n\n[u]Weaknesses :[/u]\n\n- the gameplay is too boring\n- some conditions for unlocking achievements are too obscure\n- tip: remember not to skip the credits.\n\nFind more reviews at [url=https://adolyane.wordpress.com/]Adolyane[/url]\n","timestamp_created":1609409166,"timestamp_updated":1609409166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq9+Q3PYCd8SHvwI="}
