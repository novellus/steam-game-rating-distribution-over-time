    review: 'I''m not sure what made me want to try this, really. I certainly didn''t
      expect it to be the game of the year, but I thought it could be an interesting
      little top-down shooter to poke around in.


      Every level appears to take place in the same map, with increasing numbers of
      batteries to collect and enemies to slay. The map isn''t particularly small,
      so it can get a little tedious trying to figure out where that last battery
      is.


      Although what I''ve described so far certainly isn''t engaging, it''s also not
      offensive. But unfortunately, there is a camera issue that makes the game almost
      unplayable. When the player equips the rifle, the entire screen begins to sway
      back and forth and in small circles. Is this radio tower on a ship? Why am I
      getting seasick?


      Anyway, don''t play Tech Madness.'
