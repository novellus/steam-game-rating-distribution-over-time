The AI are pretty stupid and wreck their cars during races. It can get frustrating sometimes during a race because your car can get stuck easy if not careful. The graphics are decent. There is no controller support for the Xbox controller. If you could get this game in a pack but not alone i would suggest that. Its fun but the drive to keep going and playing it doesn't last. I would rate this game a 5 out of 10. Don't buy unless in a pack! Its a goof off game were you can truck it in the woods!","timestamp_created":1291365082,"timestamp_updated":1424815463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516908168792724609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pdPn3ssCc8qxCg=="}
