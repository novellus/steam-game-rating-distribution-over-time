    review: "Done in half an hour. Price 30+ euro, WHY?\nMaybe the steam downloaded\
      \ the demo?\nAlthough I bought the full game and never pressed a button containing\
      \ text \"demo\".\n4 Levels, 2 types of enemies, 1 weapon (3 sequence combo).\n\
      Each level has 3-4 places to fight enemies. Found no bosses.\n\nEncountered\
      \ no bugs. Graphics is pretty. \nLandscape is pleasant to the eye as well. That's\
      \ about it.\n\nCombat needs polishing. Enemy amount needs polishing.\nSettings\
      \ need polishing. Character animations need polishing.\nEnglish needs polishing.\
      \ Story needs? ... there is one chat buble ...\n\nWeapon's reach is less than\
      \ a kick. Touching and enemy makes you loose a heart (out of 5).\nTurning while\
      \ fighting, even with continuing your combo, and not loose a heart nearly impossible.\n\
      Ended up doing 1-2 hits and kitting.\nMouse setting missing. Moving my mouse\
      \ 1cm made nearly 180 degrees.\nVertical Sync non existent. FPS limit non existent.\
      \ 200+ fps made my PC almost take off."
