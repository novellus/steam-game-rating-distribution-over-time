    review: 'Classic, simple retro RPG, with little to note


      Well, to the games credit, it also has some bits of character sprinkled on top,
      such as the fact that no one dies in the game. Instead, they surrunder and leave
      you. Sometimes, they come back and give you money or loot, as opposed to you
      just killing them asd snatching your loot off their dead bodies.


      By saying Retro, I mean, it''s retro in every sense. it even dialog is beyond
      simplistic and straightforward, with random people regularly just giving you
      hints strait away. I actually like this. Just basic adventure RPG gameplay with
      no strings attached, where the combat system is very simple.


      However, I would only recommend this game if you are into retro RPGs, and you''re
      looking for something to relax to


      ps: the game had many bugs upon release, but these were fixed within the first
      few days after release'
