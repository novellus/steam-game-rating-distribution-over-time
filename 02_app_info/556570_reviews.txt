There is the occasional English typo and grammar error, but nothing unreadable.\n\nIf you're struggling to find the deluxe content try searching within the game's steam folder (Library -> Right click on game title-> Properties -> Local Files -> Browse Local Files). From there, you should find everything in the folder \"Deluxe_Edition\".","timestamp_created":1596131524,"timestamp_updated":1596131524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2se20PMCeeq8mAI="}
