      /><br><br>--------------------------- EARLY ACCESS WARNING: THIS GAME IS STILL
      IN ALPHA, EARLY ACCESS STATE. YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER BUGS. YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER

      HAVE THE CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SHAPING OF A GREAT GAME --------------------------<br><br>Dwelvers
      is a real time strategy game where The player takes the role of an evil Dungeon
      Lord who guide its minions through building their own dungeon, below and above
      the surface. Manage elaborate production chains, cater to the needs and quirks
      of each monster and lead them to battles against other monsters and pathetic
      humans.<br><br>The most challenging part for the player will be creating an
      advanced production system so as to have enough food to keep the creatures well
      fed, enough weapons and armour to outfit their army as a force to be reckoned
      with, and of course enough beer to keep them satisfied with you as their master.
      <strong>A drunk minion is a happy minion!</strong> The theme of the game will
      have a lot of dark humour, and each creature will have its own personality,
      demands and fighting style; forcing the player to handle all the creatures in
      different ways in order to max out their potential. <strong>A happy minion is
      a useful minion!</strong><br><br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Multi Layered

    review: 'Edit : Abandoned!


      Old Review :


      If you''re ok with testing, you can put up with the bugs and you like the Dungeon
      Keeper genre then this is a great example.


      Its not a straight out DK clone either. It can stand on its own with a host
      of different features like production chains and resource management as well
      as three dimentional dungeon creation. This means you need to provide your minions
      with food and drink and weapons and armour. You can also be more creative and
      build things like a lava moat around your base. Oh and there''s a lot of hydrualic
      options aswell, although i havn''t played around with these yet so i cant comment
      on how they work.


      A mention also must be made for the developer Rasmus who despite being extremely
      busy working on the game still takes time out on the games own website and steam
      forums to answer posts and help out players.


      Overall a very enjoyable game even in early access as long as you accept the
      inevitable bugs.'
