      adventure with lots of shooting. Several genres are mixed in this game but despite
      that fact it isn't stuck between them and appears to be a classical RPG that
      is based on a specially developed system.<br><br><br>The action takes place
      on prison planet Alcatraz. Its inhabitants are inveterate criminals that were
      banished there for the life term for their terrible crimes. The main objective
