The tunes are awesome. The price is kind of high but it's worth it, because you will get 2 albums plus in two formats ([i]FLAC and MP3[/i]).\n\nEvery fan of the game should get this soundtrack. Plus, for those who didn't play the game and like Metal/Rock genre should try this one. It's worth listening.","timestamp_created":1420725590,"timestamp_updated":1570841186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638359785079956055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7cnb3u0CdpeANQ=="}
