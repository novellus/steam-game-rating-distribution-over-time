From what I understand the main reasons you do not recommend the game are:\n\n[*]It does not have CPU players\n[*]It does not have online multiplayer\n\nI have tried to make this as clear as possible on the store page. Unfortunately I have not translated the page into your language. I am sorry for that. However, please note that the game is not tagged as single-player. It is only tagged as:\n\n[*]Local Multi-Player\n[*]Shared/Split Screen\n[*]Full controller support\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you are unhappy with the lack of online multiplayer and CPU opponents. Please note online multiplayer is currently in development. \n\nOne final note CPU opponents is not something I am focusing on. I currently believe they are more trouble than they are worth. However if there is enough community interest in them I will add them.\n\nI would like to thank you for the feedback again, I hope you continue to follow the game and I am working hard to make Trenchfoot the best multiplayer experience possible.\n\n\nThanks,\n(1)manno"}],"cursor":"AoJwnr7+iuMCcJisnwE="}
