(Max Gladstone also authored a book series based in this setting, if you enjoyed the game.) High replay value, and an interesting real-world historical nod to the St. Francis Damn (though events can play out differently, depending).","timestamp_created":1601258961,"timestamp_updated":1601258961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hpee6fQCdsvGpAI="}
