    review: 'Cool artwork & silly yet meaningful story through the perspective of
      a young kid about the perils of bullies & life. I''ve only played about an hour
      of the game but it''s a cool little 2D beat-em-up with a nice story. I have
      some issues with the controls via keyboard, which seem like the inputs are delayed
      before the character strikes, but maybe if I connect my controller to it I''ll
      have a better time with it. It is not bad, I do recommend the game if you love
      2D fighting games & dig unique artwork.


      6.5/10 for me!!!'
