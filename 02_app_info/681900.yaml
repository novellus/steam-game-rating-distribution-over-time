    review: Very disappointing game... While There's a guide for the controls and
      ship designs there's no informations about what am I even suppossed to do in
      this game. It's probably about fighting with enemies in space, But the balance
      is a mess. All my ships are ridiculously slow and underpowered but enemies are
      complete opposite. This happens in the second stage with the lowest difficulty
      settings. Instead of overly tedious control type tutorials, It need tutorials
      about the actial gameplays and a serious rebalance.
