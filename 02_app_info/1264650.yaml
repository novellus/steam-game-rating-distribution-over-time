    review: "The art in this game is just gorgeous. The music really adds to the appeal\
      \ of the game. I'm also impressed with the ethnic diversity of the characters\
      \ in this game, and the dialogue is amusing at times too, but well-written.\
      \ This is probably one of the best HOG I have ever played. Pleasing to look\
      \ at, easy to navigate, and the puzzles are fun.\nThere are a couple annoying\
      \ things about this game, like the screen freezing with ice if you click too\
      \ much, but the most annoying thing is that the items that you need another\
      \ item to open/get to it with are not highlighted or otherwise made noticeable\
      \ at all. That would have been really nice to have so I didn't have to click\
      \ around everywhere looking for the special item. I think another game I played\
      \ used sparkles of some kind to distinguish it and then when you hovered over\
      \ it it told you that you needed another item to use this item. \nOne thing\
      \ that really, really bothers me is that there is a mobile phone in a couple\
      \ of the HO scenes and I can't for the life of me figure out why....it's never\
      \ an item you are supposed to find and I need to know what the purpose of it\
      \ being there is.\nOverall, 9/10, would buy again."
