    about_the_game: "Regimental Chess was generated from the desire to create a solid\
      \ game emulating the strategy and tactics of battle. Strategy being the art\
      \ of positioning ones formations. Tactics being the art of how they fight. At\
      \ first, the creator of this game increased the number of pieces and the size\
      \ of the battlefield.  The quick realization is that chess evolved into, and\
      \ solidified, into a board 8 squares by 8 squares for good reason. The two small\
      \ armies are therein locked into combat where every position counts.  Increase\
      \ the size of the field or the army, and all that is lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThen came the epiphany: move multiple pieces in formations rather than just\
      \ one piece at a time. Formations that are governed by rules.  Formations that\
      \ can be broken apart.  No point system is necessary. If a formation breaks\
      \ up or loses pieces through attrition, it simply becomes less effective as\
      \ a fighting unit until it is either annihilated or becomes too small to remain\
      \ relevant to the battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt then became a matter of experimenting\
      \ with the numbers of pieces and size of the board to create a balance whereby\
      \ every formation plays an important role in any given game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nIn the Napoleonic Wars, well formed infantries defeated the cavalry charge\
      \ because horses refused to charge into a wall of bayonets held by foot soldiers\
      \ that no longer turned to run. But the same densely packed infantry made an\
      \ easy target for an artillery strike. The artillery, in turn, was itself  vulnerable\
      \ to a cavalry charge. This historic dynamic of rock-paper-scissors underpins\
      \ the balance of Regimental Chess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe king is most often\
      \ captured by a formation of rooks and queens, acting like a heavy artillery.\
      \  However, this group has a difficult time capturing the king if he is surrounded\
      \ by his horses. Because of the way they are formed and move, the horses are\
      \ extremely vulnerable to charge of densely packed infantry. This infantry,\
      \ in turn, can be quickly wiped out by the rooks and queens.  It is all a matter\
      \ of how many pieces are in each formation, how the formation is shaped and\
      \ where it stands in relation to its enemies. For this reason, an immediate\
      \ strike by bishops, albeit sacrificial, is best intended to wipe out as many\
      \ rooks, queens and horses as possible, break up their formations and thus reduce\
      \ the opponent\u2019s offensive and defensive capabilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nMultiple Board Regimental Chess emulates the battle a general must wage along\
      \ a broad front, with multiple divisions and commands, each carrying out and\
      \ issuing orders. Each division protects the flank of the next division. Forces\
      \ must shift along the backfield to defend against points of attack, or to mass\
      \ forces and attack where opportunity presents itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter\
      \ all is said and done, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the game we\u2019\
      ve created and we hope you enjoy it as much.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your intellect\
      \ has a brutal streak, or your brutality has an intelligent edge, this is the\
      \ game for you."
