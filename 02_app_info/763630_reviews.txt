The controls are not intuitive at all. You teleport to a round area on the ground and then a first wave of about 12 knights is storming towards you from three different angles. If they get close to you, that's it. (\"You are lose\" as the game says)\n\nLasted about 1 min by teleporting away all the time on my first attempt. Lasted about 5sec without teleporting on my second attempt.\n\nThere will be no third attempt.","timestamp_created":1555175742,"timestamp_updated":1555175742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536930859088897705","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo9Psi+oCdO6VvwE="}
