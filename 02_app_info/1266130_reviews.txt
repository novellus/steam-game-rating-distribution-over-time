My favourite song very quickly became \"Neverending Song - Violette's Theme\" thanks to her battle being timed to the track to incorporate rhythm elements to the combat.\n\nI found this game as the composer of three of the tracks is Garoad (see his other work in \"VA-11 Hall-A\" and \"Yuppie Psycho\"), and his music fits right in with STEEL_PLUS' style. So I think I found another composer to follow in STEEL_PLUS.\n\nOnly gripe is that the audio files are not tagged properly. I had to add track numbering and album art to the files myself, and the album art is not properly included with the files (i had to grab it from the store page)","timestamp_created":1606487571,"timestamp_updated":1606487571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o9+HhfYCdIbOswI="}
