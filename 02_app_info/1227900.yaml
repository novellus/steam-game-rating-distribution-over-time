      \ you're seeking to understand different bases more intuitively, or want to\
      \ stress your mental arithmetic to its limit, you'll be able to find a level\
      \ of challenge within the game which suits you. From binary to base 16, you'll\
      \ explore the concept of number and how we relate to them in a beautiful hand-painted\
      \ world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrack and hone your mastery in career mode, unlocking\
      \ increasingly difficult settings as you progress or simply explore in sandbox\
      \ mode and find a challenge that suits you."

    review: I wish i had found this at Uni when needing to know numbers in things
      other than base 10. Its a very pretty game with good information to get you
      started learning. Good for people with no knowledge or a good knowledge of this
      kind of thing.
