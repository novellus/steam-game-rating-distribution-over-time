So many games over the past 10 years have been very short and I have gotten used to them, so this one now feels normal length.\nThe game itself is very enjoyable with the most amazingly awesome actress, Laura Frachette. What an inspired choice of actress they made, all those years ago. You control her as she does her treadmill walk around the house and gardens to discover the mystery, hunt out the ghosts and prove herself worthy of a job. \nI see a reference to Gameboomers this time, which I missed before.\nA great title and thanks for putting it on steam.","timestamp_created":1583827579,"timestamp_updated":1583827579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h97e4fACdM6Y9wE="}
