    review: "This is a really good documentary which lets you hear another side of\
      \ World War II told by some of the non-jewish victims that survived the Holocaust.\n\
      \nYou can learn a lot from this documentary and if you\xB4re interested in history\
      \ I would recommend you watch this, you can also read more about the survivors\
      \ on this website I found http://forgetusnotmovie.com/survivors/\n\nSadly at\
      \ least one of the people in this documentary has since passed away as this\
      \ documentary was dedicated to the memory of Veronika Young https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1653632968"
