    review: 'Been following development on this game for quite some time. The game
      was created by only one person which is super impressive. Usually when this
      is the case a game like this would turn out to be lacking but this game is actually
      really fun.

      Immediately the most impressive element of this game is the graphical presentation,
      its very realistic and textured well. Another thing I love is the design of
      the main character you play as the biohazard bot himself has a charm similar
      to beloved characters like Wall-E, Johnny 5, and R2D2. The game has great platforming
      and exploration and I love the new weapons you get while trying to make it to
      the end. The sound design is really cool too. Very atmospheric and immerses
      you into the game. Brilliant use of lighting also. Better than most major titles
      coming out today. Excited to see what this devloper does next. Would love to
      see more enemy designs in the next installment. I almost forgot to mention the
      physics are off the chain.

      15 bucks is a steal for this fun platformer. I also love the ability to rotate
      the camera despite the game being a sidescroller.

      Would absolutely reccomend.'
