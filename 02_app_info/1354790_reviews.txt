It's really hard to not use \"Joe\" the ingame helper for all of these pictures and if you don't have much time less than don't buy this DLC. \n\nPro:\n- if you a fan of this art and have a huge lifetime, than you can buy it\n- you got a good mouse and finger skills...it's yours \n\nCons:\n- if you wanna 100 % you need this DLC\n- high price, maybe if there is a sale you can buy it\n- \"Joe\" the ingame helper will be your new friend \n\nI like this games and i hope there coming more parts of the game, but this DLC is the horror part. But please no more of this DLCs \n","timestamp_created":1603998194,"timestamp_updated":1603998194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlcPvuvUCfarzqgI="}
