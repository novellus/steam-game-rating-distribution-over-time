But, overall, I think the good slightly outweighs the bad here.\n\nMyst III: Exile is the first in the series to be made by a third-party, and while they did a good job making the beautiful, immersive environments and challenging puzzles that you'd expect, there are some design flaws that sometimes make the game more frustrating than it's supposed to be.\n\nInstead of the static images of Myst and Riven, Exile lets you look around in 360Â° panoramas. This adds immersion but can make it harder to know where to click, and you might miss things if you don't look around. I had to look up a walkthrough in one area where the walkways blend into the natural environment, all because of a hard-to-see path that I had missed.\n\nThere are places that don't give enough of a visual indication of what to do, such as a lever that you're supposed to click and drag, even though just about every other lever in the game only needs to be clicked.\n\nThere were some puzzles I got stuck on because I didn't realize that the clues for them were back on the starting island. It seems like poor design to put clues for a puzzle in a different area from where the puzzle actually is.\n\nThe game introduces a character portrayed by [spoiler]Brad Dourif[/spoiler], whom some might remember for his portrayal of [spoiler]Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies[/spoiler], among other roles. I felt like he was a bit too over-the-top, and we saw too much of him. Some of his sequences don't really teach us anything new, and drag on a bit too long.\n\nSpeaking of over-the-top, the soundtrack. This game definitely goes in a more cinematic direction than the previous games. This will appeal to some, but it wasn't my thing. Luckily there is an option in the settings to make the background music repeat less often. The music isn't bad; just obtrusive sometimes.\n\nI still give it a thumbs up, because, for the most part, the puzzles present a satisfying challenge, enough to just outweigh the above issues. [spoiler]Amateria[/spoiler] is where the game really shines, especially when you solve the final puzzle there.","timestamp_created":1610029888,"timestamp_updated":1610030062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm6PR7vYCccqkwQI="}
