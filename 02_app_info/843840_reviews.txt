Is also not well clear when the orb can change edge. Things that I personally don't like very much are the fixed camera and the camera speed..it is too fast when changing view point, I would suggest a logaritimic/dumped speed change. I would have preferred a following/moving camera from other prospectives and the WASD movement in all directions instead of rotating the camera, but this is just my opinion. But I'm sure that the game will be implemented with our feedback.","timestamp_created":1549643468,"timestamp_updated":1549643622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw56T95ugCdOCsugE="}
