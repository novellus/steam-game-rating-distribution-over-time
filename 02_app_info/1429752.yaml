    review: 'I have this route from back before the Arriva wipe. I think it''s my
      favourite modern day british route. I usually prefer stuff set in BR times.

      Very glad to see it back, I was really sad to think that people would be missing
      out on this one. The only thing that disappointed me about this route is the
      variety of quickdrive consists: it''s slightly lower than the route''s predecessor,
      the Bristol-Cardiff route. I had to create some new preloads to make Pacers,
      Sprinters and that other small DMU from Armstrong Powerhouse appear as AI.

      I still  highly recommend this route, it''s very fun, long, fairly fast and
      has a large variety of QD traffic. A lot of trains from other packs and routes
      is programmed to appear in QD.'
