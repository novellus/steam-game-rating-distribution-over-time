      /><br><br>Folks,<br><br>It''s been a ride, I''ve been working on a game about
      Western Alaska since 2015 (RIP BISC) and been working on ThreeStep specifically
      since early-2018. Working on something this personal and intimately me is really
      taxing, and Maria could tell you a hundred stories of me nervously pacing the
      apartment mumbling about mechanics or story beats or panicking that I wasted
      my time on a bad game. In the end, I''m really proud of what ThreeStep is and
      how it turned out. <br><br>That being said it is the spookiest month, and since
      I love monsters, ghouls, skeletons, and all kinds of kitschy Halloween stuff,
      so I wanted to update ThreeStep with something spooky for ThreeStep''s content
      update.  Frigid Hellscape is a small extra mode following the killing of Jackson
      during the Story of ThreeStep, once you''ve killed him (and made sure he was
      dead) you''ll get a new main menu and a new mode available.<br><br><br><br>Thanks
      to everyone who bought ThreeStep, hope it''s as enjoyable to play as it was
      rewarding to make.<br><br>-Wyatt</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>ThreeStep follows

    review: "A well-written story about persistence and loss, with a unique setting,\
      \ as well as surprisingly intricate survival mechanics. Yes, the graphics are\
      \ a bit wonky, but they're hiding a huge amount of depth. The first time I had\
      \ to fight two wolves at once... man, it was more exciting and mechanically\
      \ complex than you would expect from a game that looks like this. \n\nI don't\
      \ know anything about Alaska, but this game paints a thoughtful and nuanced\
      \ picture of the people and environment. Honestly, this game is probably worth\
      \ the small price tag just for that. \n\nI usually don't think there's anything\
      \ terribly important about the whole \"solo dev\" thing, but Wyatt White (the\
      \ creator of the game) clearly had a singular vision for what he wanted this\
      \ game to achieve, and I think he was largely successful."
