Did I mention bugs?\n\nI was still excited about this title. The CC legacy. The reviving.\n\nI tried to play it like 10 times over the years. Install. Uninstall. Install ...\n\n... until I had to give up, eventually. Too many familiar BIS problems not letting you progress, enjoy. You feel life draining out of you while trying to play the missions. These guys cannot make one compelling video game. They just recycle their game engine and hope it is enough. Trailers can deceive. Do not let yourself be deceived.","timestamp_created":1609164161,"timestamp_updated":1609164161,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/o/q1PYCdYmOvgI="}
