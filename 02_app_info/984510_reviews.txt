It has a very approachable scope; it takes place all in one little town, and there are even sections that take place inside just one building! This mitigates the classic adventure game problem of \"man which one of the NPCs did I forget to talk to?\" because there just aren't that many people and you really can just go and talk to all of them.\nThere were never any puzzles where the solution felt stupid either, which is another adventure game problem. I always felt like \"oh yeah duh\" whenever I finally worked something out. And even if you can't work out the solution to something straight away, going around town and showing all your items to the NPCs was nice because they always had something to say about each thing, and sometimes react in really neat and unexpected ways.\nAlso there's a crab with buck-teeth and I love him.","timestamp_created":1571897446,"timestamp_updated":1571897446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575289607048034668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5/GY/u0CdIrR1AE="}
