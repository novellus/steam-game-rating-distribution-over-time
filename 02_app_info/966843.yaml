    review: Badass mech. Has moves similar in appearance to Watchbot, but functions
      differently. He lacks a standard dash or dashkicks, instead having a sprint.
      He makes up for this with the beam sword his specials give him, which effectively
      allows for a damaging special cancel without meter. Overall, a very fun mech
      to play if you're looking for something different (and let's just be honest,
      he's really cool).
