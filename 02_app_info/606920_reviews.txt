This makes it extremely counter-intuitive to use all the sound pads, as you have to thrust into them instead of hitting them like drums, as one would expect. All of the elements and interface are also way too small, as if the UI was scaled back or something. I haven't found any option in the settings to correct either of these issues. This seems like a really promising product otherwise, so I hope the devs can answer my concerns.","timestamp_created":1609964954,"timestamp_updated":1609964954,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmfTY7PYCdoqNwQI="}
