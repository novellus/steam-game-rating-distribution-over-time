They are relatively easy, entertaining, and informative. Although some players claim mission objectives are not always clear, I did not find this to be the case. As long as you check flight plan before starting the mission, and pay attention to instructions and your surrounding, you're going to be fine. Obviously, you are expected to complete all training missions before attempting these.\n\nIt is free addition to the game, so it is definitely recommended. However, I think it deserved to be paid more than Epic Approaches, which I think should have been free given short duration of missions and release during Early Access stage\n","timestamp_created":1525110818,"timestamp_updated":1525110818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzYjsi+MCcdKvnwE="}
