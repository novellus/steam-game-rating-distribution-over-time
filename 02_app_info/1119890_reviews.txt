Not near as big a fan as for RPG's, RTS and Turn Based but for me the match three genre is a break. As other people have said, the sound busts up, and I cannot see why they do not do something about that (but I am not a coder...), and perhaps add a little more *snap* to the graphics, but at $3.99 ??? Hey, play it... It has that draw to complete \"just one more\" level... plant a few things and maybe add to the building you are working on.... \n","timestamp_created":1587005970,"timestamp_updated":1587005970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5aq7wPECeaiRgQI="}
