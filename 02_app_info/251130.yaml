    review: "I didn't think I'd like this game, but wow! Gave it a try on sale and\
      \ glad I did!\n\nI wasn't into the Power Rangers, I was too old when they became\
      \ popular.  I didn't understand the rules, like, why didn't they use the giant\
      \ robot to start with?  Why did they risk bodily harm by fighting without their\
      \ power suits on?  Why all unnecessary acrobatics?  This game provides answers\
      \ to these and more, in a way.\n\nIt's a generic tactical game, where you can\
      \ buy weapons and armor (I'd say armor is more crucial to keep upgraded, but\
      \ each character should have a weapon as they provide an extra ability).  Battles\
      \ take place on a square grid, you move your characters in turn-based fashion\
      \ within range of your opponent and fight or use a skill.  Skills use cooldowns\
      \ to recharge. \n\nGiant robot battles are 1-on-1 turn based affairs with a\
      \ slight hand/eye coordination mini-game for attacks and defense, with a variety\
      \ of interchangeable robot parts which provide additional stats and skills.\n\
      \nMoney is earned based on how successfully you complete each episode and how\
      \ much audience you gained (from attacking, acrobatics, and following director's\
      \ instructions).  You can use the earnings to upgrade your studio, props (weapons\
      \ and armor), or hire an advertising agency.  You can craft weapons, armor and\
      \ robot parts with the right materials.  Crafting materials can be found by\
      \ defeating foes or purchased in randomized boxes.\n\nI've only played through\
      \ once, but there is replay value in the neat concept, as well as multiple game\
      \ paths and choices in responding to fan email.  As I wrote at the beginning,\
      \ this game was a pleasant surprise.  Still not into Power Rangers but def into\
      \ Chroma Squad!"
