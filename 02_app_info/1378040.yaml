    about_the_game: In a world where magic is as common as the air we breathe, twin
      sisters Tear and Lumiere run a clinic in the remote village of Armeria. There
      they use their magic to heal the sick and injured.<br><br>One day, while the
      sisters are enjoying a meal, they are interrupted by a strange noise coming
      from their basement. However, it is no ordinary basement, but a library full
      of magical books passed down through their family for generations.<br><br>Fearing
      that it may be a ghost, they cautiously go to investigate and find a book engulfed
      in a glowing light. Instinctively, Tear reached out toward the glowing tome
      and as she did, it flipped open!<br><br>Before either of the sisters could blink,
      out leaped a terrifying demon who grabbed Lumiere and pulled her into the tome.<br><br>&quot;If
      you want to see your sister alive again, then you'll have to come get her! Hahaha!&quot;<br><br>Knowing
      that it may be a trap, Tear gathered her courage to follow them and bring her
      sister home safe and sound.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Classic
