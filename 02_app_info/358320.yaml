      \ demais! Eu fiquei impressionado em ver um jogo de plataforma com uma jogabilidade\
      \ t\xE3o boa da \xE9poca dos jogos de DOS.\nA pixel art do game \xE9 bel\xED\
      ssima e os personagens possuem muitos frames de anima\xE7\xE3o para executarem\
      \ in\xFAmeras a\xE7\xF5es, o que deixa o jogo mais bonito ainda!\nO level design\
      \ tamb\xE9m \xE9 muito bom, fazendo com que a curva de dificuldade aumente gradativamente\
      \ com o decorrer do jogo.\nRecomendo para quem curte jogos de plataforma lateral."
