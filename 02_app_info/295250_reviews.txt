(another game by the same dev, Peter Moorhead)\n\nThe game has an unique soundtrack, great art and a rather depressing 'plot'. The sole reason why I think this game as a \"missed opportunity\" is the storytelling. \n\nSo... there's no storytelling. And we don't have a story to begin with. Which is why this game is getting all the downvotes. We start off in a wrecked spaceship that has just crashed on a planet. We get out from the pod and our objective is... What? What is our objective? We have no clear indication of where to go or what to do or where we are, in short: if you ask any kind of Wh- Questions, you won't get any answers. That's it. The only reason why the game becomes so boring until the ending, the reason why you get so confused while playing is because there's no lore. Even saying three sentences could've made this game at least bearable, for example when we get out of the pod, the character could've said [spoiler] Death is imminent. I have to activate them..Quick.\" [/spoiler] and believe me, this would make the whole experience so much better! At least we would know what was going on or at least what to do.\n\nAnd my only critique about the gameplay is that, the character walks SO slow and we don't know where to click. It's a point and click game. Just like what they did in Murder, they could have just created indicators of where I can click or not. Jesus, it's a point and click game. The only thing that you had to nail was this.\n\nOverall, when the ending 'happens' every nonsense going on finally made sense. And I think the creator went for the \"Just feel it in your heart.\" kind of storytelling which is understandable, but that doesn't really work with games all the time.\n\nIt was a short experience and I found lots and lots of improvable elements about it, I'm still going to upvote this because of the OST and the pixel art.","timestamp_created":1598300763,"timestamp_updated":1609535729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549071609973907471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41sXz3/YCerfGnQI="}
