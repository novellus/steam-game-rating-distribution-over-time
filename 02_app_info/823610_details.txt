As a last resort, you fled into an unknown forest. Suddenly, a witch appears in front of you, pointing to a house not far away, saying she can provide food, water, and a place to rest. However, upon arriving at the house, the woman disappeared. Before entering, you find that it is in fact a cave. Then you're informed by a note that the witch needs you to enter the cave and find the Dragon Knight, Sowen, who has a magical weapon that he intends on using to open the Gates of Hell. So you descend into the dungeon and begin your search for the Dragon Knight and the powerful weapon he possesses, hoping to stop him before he puts an end to the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/823610\/extras\/Steam商店用图_酒馆.gif?t=1597206109\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Owner of the Dragonslayer tavern, Rula<\/h2>Once upon a time...
