I have played hundreds and hundreds of hours of it, and I still play it years after its release. However, I cannot recommend this DLC. Fighting battles on too many of these tactical maps is simply not fun. I disabled this DLC and no longer use it...ever.","timestamp_created":1608091688,"timestamp_updated":1608091688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxPvutPYCcIDOugI="}
