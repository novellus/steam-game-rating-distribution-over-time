Just for you, I'll copy/paste parts of my review for the gameplay.\n\nHacker Evolution is perhaps a writing simulator, as you need to type the command but you need your brains to avoid to be traced and to have a game over. Sometimes, you'll need to begin a new campaign because you can't do anything but try a different manner to avoid spending too much money you've \"stolen\" or to add to your trace level. That's perhaps the most frustrating thing in HE.\n\nYou're going to read files, find passwords, find exploit files that will make your life easier, crack, decrypt, use your brains to know how many hosts you need, upgrade your hardware (should I add a faster modem or a better firewall or more CPU Ram?).\n\nThat's the core of HE. However, if you're here, it means that you already know about the graphics and the great soundtrack. So, is the Hardcore Package worthy?\n\nThe weird thing is that the Hardcore Package 1 is... easy. Hack all the servers with money and you will have no problem to solve two levels.\n\nYep, the package is having only two levels. For 2 euros, I would have expecting at least a little more than two easy levels for a package that should make you sweat and look tightly at your bounces, level traces, etc...\n\nI'm still recommending them anyway, because it's always nice to have more levels. If you want a real challenge, try the second package!\n\nNB: if you have HE: Untold, the two Hardcore Packages are the same as those for HE.","timestamp_created":1448833023,"timestamp_updated":1448833185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616460800170898438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zv7LqtECfsP0SQ=="}
