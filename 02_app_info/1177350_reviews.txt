Most of the time, I wasn't fighting clowns with my mallet but I WAS fighting the controls. \n\nThe worst part? I think I reached Level 6, died, and you are forced to start over again. From the beginning. With a story and some major tweaks, I believe this game could have been a REALLY good indie platformer. As it stands, I will have to give it a NO from me.","timestamp_created":1582646718,"timestamp_updated":1582646718,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54791259765625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw443GvvACcIvF9AE="}
