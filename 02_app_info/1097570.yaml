    about_the_game: "Five hunters have tracked the beast and failed. Now it's YOUR\
      \ turn!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYOU are a hunter; a man or woman of wealth and leisure\
      \ who has turned their time to hunting the fiendish monsters that assail humanity.\
      \  One such horror is plaguing the city of Harrow's Gate.  The last five hunters\
      \ to search for it have all gone missing.  You must find them and lay the monster\
      \ low!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  A choose your own adventure novel in which your\
      \ choices and actions can lead you to glorious victory...or ignoble defeat.\
      \  Explore an original story with three challenging game difficulties, unlock\
      \ hidden lore to better understand the world you enter, and enjoy the artwork\
      \ you discover in the gallery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  This independently produced\
      \ novel features a dark soundtrack (with optional atmospherics) by Cryo Chamber,\
      \ as well as over 40 unique page images to unlock. <br />\r\n The text of the\
      \ game has also been recorded by a professional musician and story-teller, making\
      \ it into an interactive audiobook.   Featuring no battle-royale shenanigans\
      \ and produced without 100-hour work weeks, Vile Philosophy is an old-fashioned,\
      \ spine-chilling steampunk tale you can enjoy time and time again."

      notes: "The Hunter's Journals - Vile Philosophy contains frequent references\
        \ to violence throughout the content in the form of descriptive text.  The\
        \ page images avoid directly referencing topics and content that would disturb\
        \ younger players but cannot be considered suitable for viewers of all ages,\
        \ even if they are presented without context in the gallery.  The voice over\
        \ directly follows the text on screen and so should be turned off when at\
        \ work or in the presence of sensitive individuals.\r\n\r\nOverall the game\
        \ contains mature themes and is not suitable for children.  However, all of\
        \ this content is provided in the form of a dark fantasy novel with vivid\
        \ descriptions of combat and it's effects on the human (and inhuman) body.\
        \  There are no cutscenes or animated violence, and the images have been selected\
        \ and edited to keep them from being too extreme.  The game should be suitable\
        \ for anyone who enjoys horror novels and Lovecraftian fiction."

    review: 'The voice-over for the Lady of Blades is oddly enticing.


      Jokes aside, this choose-your-own-adventure styled visual novel was an engaging
