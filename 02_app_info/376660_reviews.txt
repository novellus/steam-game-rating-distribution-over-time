Some of her abilities are interesting, but not that different than the others.    The big disappointment is the voice acting.  She mumbles half her lines, the volume is low and you can't hear half of what she says. The game doesn't have a separate volume slider for voices so there's no fixing it. I would pass on this class.","timestamp_created":1596246982,"timestamp_updated":1596246982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1//u0/MCc+XamAI="}
