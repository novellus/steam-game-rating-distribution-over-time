'Concing' is a unique skill that grows through practice and after a lot of failure if you're willing to stick with it - no one should pick up this game ready to be good at it straightaway. The physics are unforgiving and treacherous, but getting to the top of a series of platforms can leave the player feeling like reaching the summit of Everest.\n\nI suppose there are different ways to play this and some people will go with the \"brute force\" approach where they try consecutively try to finish a stage and then the next and so on. My blood pressure can't take that many consecutive dives in the fountain, so my advice is to treat this like a puzzle title from Steam where you open it every so often, try a few, and if it doesn't work then do something else for a while and come back to it. I've seen players who are good at this though. If you are, lean into that and blitz every course, but that's not me and it's not how I recommend that a new player go through it.\n\nCan I recommend it? Sure, I believe that I can. Looking at the graphics will lead some users to think it's a blocky obstacle course made with leftover content from Minecraft, but that's reading this title the wrong way. The developer's aesthetic was put in place for a reason. It's groovy, campy, kitcsh, sassy, nostalgic - it's got it's own vibe. It's not trying to be \"Crysis\", it's trying to be \"Conc Perfect\" and that's what it is.","timestamp_created":1608601123,"timestamp_updated":1608601221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+NaGxPYCdJ2JvAI="}
