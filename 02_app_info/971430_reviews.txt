You can tell the developer put a lot of attention to every detail of the project. The writing is good and fun, like a cheeky Lovecraftian storyline. The music and the art is great, really gives you the feel of it being a game made by a company back in the early days of videogames.\n\nFor a small project, you get a good amount of things to do in the game besides beating it. Collect letters, solve situations with different items, have different endings, do a puzzle. The fact that the developer is active on the forum answering people's questions is also a positive point in my book. You can see that they care about the work they've put out.\n\nSo, although is a complete (short) adventure... I'm left wanting more! I'll definitely keep an eye on this for the next installments of the series. For such a small price, I would seriously advice people to give it a chance. This is the type of project you want to support.","timestamp_created":1609645380,"timestamp_updated":1609645380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmuqV4/YCdK/5vwI="}
