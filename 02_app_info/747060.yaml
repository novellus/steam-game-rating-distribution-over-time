    review: "GC III Intrigue is a good purchase, especially if you're a player (like\
      \ myself), who really likes to play a variety of styles. This DLC allows for\
      \ that more so than before, with clear government types that have realistic\
      \ and proportioned strengths/weaknesses/assets. \n\nAlthough some players do\
      \ not like the commonwealths, I think it's a great idea and fun to use them.\
      \ Unlike many 4x games, it adds another layer of \"realism\", a sense of political\
      \ decision making that goes beyond, \"all these worlds are mine and do what\
      \ ever I want\". Similar to colonization in human history, setting up colonies\
      \ in far away places is costly and not easy; they tend to run themselves whether\
      \ the mother country likes it or not, but are still their citizens. So, if you\
      \ just limit the number of colonies by government type in a game, that \"seems\"\
      \ artificial, slows down the game, and there is an incentive to just play for\
      \ the governments that allow for the most colonization. However, with commonwealths,\
      \ it allows a player to maintain a certain style of government and forces a\
      \ player to \"THINK\" about how to expand. Which newly conquered worlds or established\
      \ colonies or resources should you keep direct control over and which will be\
      \ allowed to have some autonomy? AND by autonomy, I don't mean the auto governor\
      \ that frees up micro-managing, but political autonomy with loyalty to the home\
      \ world.\n\nAlso, the expanded Bazaar is useful strategically, as well as, the\
      \ spying and galactic market. All of which I find fun to employ and definitely\
      \ use to strategic advantage. Over-all, this DLC adds more layers and ways to\
      \ play the game."
