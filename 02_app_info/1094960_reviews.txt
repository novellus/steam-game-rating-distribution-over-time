Grip to SHEATH a weapon . . . why? I was in combat in last room of the run, and I sheathed my weapon mid fight . . . . cause I grip something when I hold it I don't let go to hold something and reverse, my god this annoyed me so much\n2. the dungeons seem very plain, definitely considering the long loading times and how little is loaded per load screen, takes you out of the experience\n3. TOO. MANY. MIMICS. I could tell the chest was a mimic but you can't do any thing but attempt to open it til it attacks, I tried casting spells and hitting it preemptively, doesn't work. I had 5 mimics in my single run. Mimics should be used sparely and effectively, placing them so commonly diminishes the effect of such a wonderful creature (This message is brought to you by the Mimics appreciation society)\n4. having to kill all enemies before you can continue, why MUST I fight? surely I should be able to avoid a fight if I feel the enemy is too powerful, but the rooms are locked with either death or kill all the only completion scenarios.\n5. Melee combat feels a bit wagglely, the enemy strikes very quickly bit this is offset by the fact they can barely hit, a better ramp up would be good, with more clear parrying results \n\nNow what does the game do right?\nThe good:\n1. Traps work fairly well, that said a skeleton walked through a wire and it didn't activate so might not be perfect, but they are reasonable enough to spot that it's not just a random HP reduction\n2. the atmosphere, the dungeons, whilst bare, do feel like lost dungeons, the music plays well and the overall graphics are fairly nice\n3. gold upgrade system per run, works again, pretty well, the descriptions are clear enough that I can tell what swords I would want to buy eventually etc\n\n\noverall I have more bad points than good, but of the dungeon crawler games I have tried this is one of the better ones so far, some just don't play well at all, and others are just garish, I look forward to seeing updates to this game and will be keeping my eye on it\n\nTLDR: the current price reflects it's early access polish, but is worthwhile if you want a dungeon crawler that could possibly last you a while, but it won't haunt you til your dying days if you give it a miss","timestamp_created":1609437609,"timestamp_updated":1609437609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wp/93PYCdtSVvwI="}
