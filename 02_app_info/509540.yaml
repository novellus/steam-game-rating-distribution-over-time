    review: "One of the earliest VR games and it really shows: items interactions\
      \ are clunky and visuals are very outdated. There are some nice puzzles there,\
      \ but also a a lot of bland and frustrating ones.\n\nPros:\n+ Pirate ship level\
      \ is really great: it got the best puzzle in the game and even decent looking\
      \ environments \n\nCons:\n- Item handling are janky and do not have any physical\
      \ feedback. And a lot of time it's impossible to tell if the object is interactable\
      \ by looking at it\n- Visuals are bad even by 2016 VR standards\n- Final chapter\
      \ got some really obscure abstract puzzles, especially compared to logical environmental\
      \ puzzles of precious levels\n- Loading time is very long\n- Story doesn't make\
      \ a lot of sense"
