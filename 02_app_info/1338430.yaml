    about_the_game: "Have you ever dream to sit in your isolated room and contemplate\
      \ your broken mind? Yeah... This game won't help you cure it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThis is a simulation of how bad a person reacts to isolation. It may be scary,\
      \ it contains horror elements, but the point is to experience a mind going wild\
      \ in the isolated space.<br />\r\nThis is only a prototype, not a full vertical\
      \ slice of a game. The whole thing should take you no more than 20 minutes,\
      \ you may experience weird noises, anxiety and mirages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      And one thing more, the experience can be different for each individual. Do\
      \ not panic.<br />\r\nIf you feel dizzy or you experience rising heartbeat,\
      \ please turn off this game by simple tapping Escape button."

      notes: It's a horror, it can be scary, expect flickering light, monsters, maybe
        jump-scares and creepy voices.
