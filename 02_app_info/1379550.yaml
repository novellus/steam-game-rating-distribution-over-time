    about_the_game: "It is a bit difficult to classify The USB Stick Found in the\
      \ Grass as a game; it is more of a combination of a literary work and a forensic\
      \ puzzle. If you liked A Normal Lost Phone or Her Story, you will probably like\
      \ TUSFitG. You are given a virtual representation of a USB stick that was found\
      \ at a scene of a possible crime and you play a police officer trying to solve\
      \ a case with very limited information. You are not given any tools to do so,\
      \ but you can use any tools you have on your computer. The USB Stick Found in\
      \ the Grass is not subject to any intrinsic limitations on which the game is\
      \ built. Quite the opposite: TUSFitG is as close to the real thing as possible.\
      \ The USB drive you will be investigating is indistinguishable from a real one.\
      \ The tools you will be using are real. If something looks like it can be checked,\
      \ it can be checked. If something can't be checked, it wasn't our intention\
      \ \u2013 it\u2019s simply the result of a built-in technological limitation.\
      \ Your job is to find what it is all about, if the stick is in any way related\
      \ to what have happened and IF anything happened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd remember:\
      \ sometimes it is the journey that is more important than the destination!"
