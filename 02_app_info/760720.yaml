    short_description: In the depths of Kanak, the Necrons awakened - the baleful
      Xenos who are alien to all that is living. Your squad has the honour to be the
      first to fight them; you are to prove that the name of Valgard Twice-Slain is
      worthy to be mentioned in the Space Wolves' sagas. For Russ and the Allfather!

    review: 'Original campaign had about 10% annoying missions. Here they have been
      able to up that to 90%.


      > mission parameters change, but not because of replayability, but just to throw
      you off first time

      > multiple enemy spawns with triggers you are forced to memorize

      > unclear level design that makes unit movement planning very difficult

      > persistent enemy abilities that you are not able to review (every turn teleport,
      resistance to damage)'
