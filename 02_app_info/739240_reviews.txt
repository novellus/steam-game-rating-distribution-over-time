Let’s get into the story.\n\nIt’s a late night in Southern Ohio as Todd Collins a worker for the White Cross Electric Company has crashed his car, luckily he's okay and even better he's not far from the old abandoned University he was sent out to investigate due to the power being on, but what is going on at the that is a truth abandoned University? Todd will unfortunately discover.\n\nNow the likes. The story is pretty good if you choose to listen to the story crystals in the game. The voice acting in the game was nice, some of it was good but others you could probably tell we're putting on fake accents but it was still good.  \n\nThe music was good, the puzzles were okay and the RPG Maker graphics were nice. Price for the game was good. it was very fair for such a short game.\n\nNow the dislikes. The game is not really all that scary despite being a horror game, I mean it was kind of scary if you listened to the story crystals but other than that again the game really wasn't all that scary. Game’s a bit short, also the ending for the game was kind of bad. \n\n[spoiler] After escaping the facility and finding your boss's car the game just abruptly ends. I mean it should have ended with the monster showing up or Todd finding his boss’s cell phone and calling the police and the game slowly transitions to the credit. [/spoiler] \n\nNow that I have got that done The Ghosts of Hackney Mills is an okay horror game. With a pretty good story, good music and nice voice acting. So if you're looking for a short RPG Maker horror game this could be for you.","timestamp_created":1601913191,"timestamp_updated":1601913191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pe/d/PQCcMuGpgI="}
