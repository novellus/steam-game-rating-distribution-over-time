Like an old Mavis Beacon typing game. BUT, the \"Boss Battles\" literally ruin the entire game. You face your first \"Boss\" on level 5, and at first it almost looks like the old arcade game where enemies move towards you and you have to destroy them. The general idea (Or what it SHOULD be) is each enemy has a letter assigned to it and you have to hit them 2-3 times (or the game has shitty hit box I don't know) to destroy them. Which is fine, until you get to the last few enemies. The problem comes from the fact that when there's only one-five enemies floating around, your \"gun\" auto-shoots once every second or so, which wouldn't be bad if it would shoot when you hit a key. So when your guy is autoshooting, unless you get lucky and an enemy happens to float in front of that auto-shot, you can do NOTHING but sit there and wait for them to destroy you.\n\nIt SHOULD be set up so that as the line of enemies moves towards you, whichever key you press shoots the correstponding enemy. \n\nI lost the \"boss fight\" 3 times, because my gun is just sitting there auto-shooting around the enemies until they hit me.","timestamp_created":1500597388,"timestamp_updated":1500597388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwruCksd0Cc+W/gAE="}
