    about_the_game: "A drive to replace ageing, costly diesel locomotives across Europe\
      \ has seen a number of new generation diesel fleets enter service in recent\
      \ years, including the advanced ER20 Eurorunner, now available for Train Simulator\
      \ in the eye-catching MRCE black gloss livery.<br><br>The ER20 \u2018Hercules\u2019\
      \ is considered to be one of the quietest and most efficient diesel locomotives\
      \ currently operating in Europe, having been manufactured with up-to-date diesel\
      \ engine technology and innovative sound insulation, alongside low exhaust emissions.\
      \ The locomotive is also relatively unique in design, being made of as few parts\
      \ as possible in a modular construction method, which makes construction and\
      \ maintenance more efficient.<br><br>Built by Siemens over a ten year period\
      \ from 2002, the ER20 was designed to replace older freight locomotive types\
      \ with lower cost maintenance and emissions. They have proved to be a popular\
      \ class of locomotive, although their low production numbers \u2013 less than\
      \ 100 \u2013 is only such due to the widespread electrification of Europe\u2019\
      s rail network reducing the need for large diesel locomotive fleets.<br><br>Customers\
      \ in Germany, Austria, Lithuania and Hong Kong placed orders for the ER20 Eurorunner\
      \ for both freight and passenger operations, including MRCE, a freight locomotive\
      \ leasing company who took ownership of 15 models. This fleet of black gloss\
      \ liveried locomotives can be seen today hauling multimodal freight traffic\
      \ across Germany and into neighbouring European countries.<br><br>The ER20 Eurorunner\
      \ for Train Simulator recreates the locomotive in the striking MRCE black gloss\
      \ livery and features SIFA and PZB signalling and cab control systems, centre\
      \ sprung throttle and brake controls, and accompanying Zags and Shimms freight\
      \ wagons.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the\
      \ freedom to drive the MRCE ER20 Eurorunner on any Quick Drive enabled route\
      \ for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included\
      \ are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/222588\"\
