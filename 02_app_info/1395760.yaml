      \ /><br><br>\u300CMars Plan\u300D is a game to build a colony on Mars and ensure\
      \ its prosperity.<br><br>   In this game, you will start from scratch to obtain\
      \ minerals and energy from Mars, build a hydroponic farm to store food, build\
      \ habitats to accept batches of immigrants.<br><br><br>    This is not enough.\
      \ The harsh environment on Mars will bring a lot of trouble to your colony.\
      \ Low air pressure, high radiation, large sandstorms, etc. There is no future\
      \ in dealing with various natural disasters.<br><br>    Therefore, you need\
      \ to research more powerful technologies, build more powerful colonies, and\
      \ even perform some surgery on Mars to make it more livable and become the real\
      \ master of Mars.<br><br><br>    In addition, there are stories and troubles\
      \ where there are people. With the increasing colonial population, they have\
      \ their own joys and sorrows, and they will also have various needs. If you\
      \ ignore them, you are afraid that one day they will ruin the great future of\
      \ Mars.<br><br>    So, you need to build living and entertainment facilities,\
      \ promulgate various welfare policies, and provide residents with all-round\
      \ convenience for food, clothing, housing, transportation. When people have\
      \ a happy life, the colony has a bright future, and the entire Mars Plan will\
      \ be meaningful.<br><br><br>    The place names in the game are all real Martian\
      \ landform names, and they land at almost the correct geographical location\
      \ according to latitude and longitude. For example, the Valles Marineris, the\
      \ Acidalia Planitia, Tempe Fossae, etc.<br>    Therefore, even if you run the\
      \ colony poorly, at least you have learned a lot about the geography of Mars,\
      \ which may be useful when you go to Mars yourself, right?<br><br><br>    I\
      \ hope this game can give you a special journey to colonize Mars. If you have\
      \ a strong interest in colonizing Mars, you can learn more about the Mars Plans\
      \ of the great brains in the real world. Maybe they just need some attention\
      \ from ordinary or extraordinary people like me and you.<br><br><br><img src=\"\
