    review: "[u] This review was written in English and Russian in purpose to save\
      \ your money and time. [/u]\n\n [i] \u201CThe fundamental cause of trouble in\
      \ the world is that the stupid are sure while the intelligent are full of doubt\u201D\
      . \nBertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell [/i]\n\n\nThe fundamental\
      \ cause of trouble of the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/chowderchu] Chowdertwo\u2019\
      s developer (nicknamed Chowderchu) [/url] is that he is absolutely sure he can\
      \ be a video games developer. \n\nBeyond all doubt that\u2019s far from the\
      \ truth because this game is REALLY bad.\n \nA little bird told me the developer\
      \ ignores the fact that an investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.\
      \ As a result we have this so-called \u201Cgame\u201D because the developer\
      \ spent his mom\u2019s money on this product. \n\nSo far I thought that you\
      \ ought to have talents, skills, imagination to be a video games developer.\
      \ But it was before I played the first part of this product (Chowderchu) \n\
      Chowdertwo is the second part of the game.\n\nCons\n\n1. Chowdertwo\u2019s controls\
      \ are shockingly bad in purpose for being \u201Chardcore\u201D. \nYour main\
      \ control scheme is A and D to move left/right, W or Space to jump, Shift to\
      \ teleport, Tab to use doors and talk, right click to leave some weird bomb\
      \ thing and then left click is for your attack and \u201Cbetter\u201D jump.\
      \ \n\n[u] The controls are non-configurable [/u]. \n\nYour basic jump (off of\
      \ W/Space) ability is little weak so you have to draw a line from your character\
      \ to the spot where you want to jump and he flings in that direction, which\
      \ sounds easy, but you don't know where you're exactly going and you had to\
      \ correct your course once you're in the air, but it's so hard to control because\
      \ your character flies through the air so quick that it's really difficult to\
      \ process what's going on. \n\nEveryone knows that good entertainment is good\
      \ and bad one is bad except for the Chowdertwo\u2019s developer. \nIs Chowdertwo\
      \ a hardcore game? No, there\u2019re just awkward controls, for sure.\n\n2.\
      \ I don't think I've ever played a game in Steam with such terrible graphic\
      \ and artwork. Oh, wait\u2026 I\u2019ve seen a worse game \u2013 Chowderchu.\
      \ \nThe environment is a total clustercuss of indistinguishable assets and the\
      \ characters themselves might actually make you vomit. \nProbably you've seen\
      \ better character concepts on the average 14 year olds Deviant Art page. \n\
      \nFrankly speaking Chowdertwo\u2019s graphics is better than the Chowderchu\u2019\
      s one. \nDon't get me wrong, it's still terrible. But not as utterly awful and\
      \ eye-damaging as Chowderchu (the first part of this product). \nI suppose the\
      \ developer hired some schoolboys to make graphics less toxic and acid. \n\n\
      3. As for the soundtrack there\u2019s a loud PC-speaker\u2019s noise instead\
      \ of it. By the way, you can\u2019t lower or turn off this grating noise so\
      \ your ears will be literally bleeding. \n\n4. The gameplay could have been\
      \ worse, e.g. like in Chowderchu but it\u2019s still boring and unfriendly.\
      \ \n\nI\u2019m not surprised there is no save/load system or checkpoints but\
      \ in Chowdertwo you have 100 lives instead of 3 ones in Chowderchu.\nThe level\
      \ design is lazy and lame. The enemies and bosses are boring and game relies\
      \ too much on instant kills everywhere for difficulty instead of clever level\
      \ design.\n\n5. The in-game\u2019s text is unpolished and made of poopy jokes\
      \ for schoolboys (indeed, not clever ones).\nMany times in the game you see\
      \ the phrase \u201CCh\u043Ewd be with you\u201D. \nYou know [url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chowd]\
      \ the meaning of Ch\u043Ewd written in Urban Dictionary [/url], don\u2019t you?\
      \ \n\n6. Overall the game is a just an unpolished, buggy example of the terrible\
      \ platform game that should be labeled \"Early Access\" at best.\nBut you can\
      \ count some false positive reviews. To be honest I don\u2019t know why some\
      \ people say something like \u201Cthis is the best game they've ever played\u201D\
      , unless they've never played any other games or they're acquainted with the\
      \ developer somehow. This game looks and feels like a pre-alpha build. \n\n\
      7. The developer behaves himself very strange. He likes to write insulting comments\
      \ and then delete them. It\u2019s seems he is Russian but he thinks that he\
      \ is American. And he hates the truth for sure, e.g. he banned me from the Chowdertwo\u2019\
      s forum BEFORE this review was written.\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll flag this\
      \ review as \u201CAbusive\u201D coz of his hatred for the truth.\n\nFree advice\
      \ to dev: to be conscious that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge.\
      \ \n\nPros\n\n1. You can delete the game and ask for refund. Seriously there\
      \ ought to be a tag \u201Crefund simulator\u201D for this product in Steam.\
      \ \nThank Gabe Newell for Steam refund system!\n\nThere's nothing fun about\
      \ this game. It's a platformer with horrible controls and music that drives\
      \ you insane. I tried to find something nice about this game. But there's nothing.\n\
      \nAll in all the game should be an example of the game made down and out so\
      \ I DO NOT RECOMMEND it for your sanity. \n______________________________________________________________\n\
