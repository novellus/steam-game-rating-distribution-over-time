    review: 'A neat pixel-art action platformer, from the creators of 1001 Spikes.
      The game has its flaws, but is still worth the price tag.


      When it was over after about two hours I wished there was more. The game has
      four levels divided into several section, where at the level end a boss awaits.
      You have your basic sword attack, a magic fireball, that consumes mana and a
      healing potion, that you can use a few time. All these mechanics can be upgraded
      by items you find in chests though the game. There are a few other mechanics
      you can buy, like a double jump.


      Some technical issue I noticed are button presses, that are not registered sometimes
      (e.g. the double jump) and some minor slow downs. If you read the forum the
      slowdowns can be much more serious, as other people reported. Another issue
      are the settings, which are quite limited (no v-sync, no button remapping) and
      are presented in an overlay UI, that doesn''t fit the pixel style and feel out
      of place.


      I hope the developer someday revisits its games, like they did for 1001 Spikes,
      to turn the "neat" from the beginning into a "great".'
