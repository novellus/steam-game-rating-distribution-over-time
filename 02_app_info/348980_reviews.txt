Here were my impressions:\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Level 1:[/b] I start out in a hallway with some platforms you can jump on.  The platforms lead nowhere.  I turn the corner and there is the level-exit.  Okay?\n\n[*] [b]Level 2:[/b] I'm in a room with a door in the middle.  There is semi-transparent wall surrounding it.  I walk to the other side and find a hole, and then walk through it to the exit.\n\n[*] [b]Level 3:[/b] I start in an empty hallway that leads nowhere.  I turn around and there's a button.  I press the button, and a staircase opens, with the level exit at the bottom.\n\n[*] [b]Level 4:[/b] I'm in an empty room with a circle on the ground in the corner, and a button on the wall.  I press the button, and a ball falls from the ceiling.  Some text appears explaining I need to roll the ball onto the circle.  Doing so is difficult, because the controls are terrible.  I finally get it onto the circle, and the exit door appears.\n\n[*] [b]Level 5:[/b] I'm in a big empty red room.  No wait, there are platforms that can only be seen if there is red background behind them.  That's cool! Unfortunately, rather than making a cool puzzle out of this, they decided to make a mindless platformer.  I need to hop from one invisible platform to the next to reach the exit.  It takes a long time because the jumping is clunky and the landings are slippery.\n\n[*] [b]Level 6:[/b] This level is much bigger.  It looks like it could actually be a puzzle.  No wait, it's just more invisible platforming with bad controls.  Great.\n\n[*] [b]Level 7:[/b] Very long and precise invisible platforming. I fall for the 10th time, and exit the game.\n[/list]\n\nThis game is utterly terrible.  The UI is so bad I accidentally deleted my save-game while writing this review.  The map designer was clearly in the process of learning how to make levels.  The entire game feels like a college project.  It deserves an 'A', but definitely should not be sold as an actual product for people to buy.\n\nI can't think of any way the developers could salvage this game.  Just avoid it.","timestamp_created":1438461233,"timestamp_updated":1535604775,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":120,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.901645481586456299","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4havLxOUCfamSQg=="}
