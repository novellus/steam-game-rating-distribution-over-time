      of the realm. The Villagers cry out for a hero! Someone to rise up and rescue
      them from their plight. This burden falls to you. Build a city, train an army,
      and equip your subjects. Seek out the assistance of helpful allies, such as
      dwarves, amazons, and sorceresses. With allies to help, and an army of your
      own, you can defeat the invading army and make the realm safe again!<img src="https://battlecruiser.ru/wstd/english.jpg"

      crossorigin="anonymous"/><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>Unlike
      regular Tower Defense games, Warstone TD has a unique method of summoning defenders
      (towers). You start with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place
      defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from
      enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful
      Warstones also appear occasionally which give significant bonuses to defenders
      standing on them. You can summon any of the 5 basic defenders on the stones:
      Peasant, Archer, Rifleman, Sorceress, and Elemental. Each basic defender has
      its own upgrade path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities! <br><br><br>Warstone
      TD also has 2 extra base units only available for use in attack/defense missions,
      the Eagle and the Wolf. Each have branching upgrade paths, like the basic defenders.
      With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of
      tactics in PvP battles, increasing replayability even further!<br><br>There
      are 30 story missions and each mission has 3 modes: Campaign, Challenge, and
      Survival. The player can choose the difficulty of each mission from 4 settings:
      Easy, Normal, Hard, and Nightmare. Each mode has a unique achievement which
      gives a star when completed, the color of the star corresponds to the difficulty
      of the mission: gold for Nightmare, silver for Hard, and bronze for Normal.
      Levels have a lot of possible solutions but, with so many combinations, you''re
      going to need to perfect your strategy to master them. And just in case you
      forget how awesome you are, there''s an online leaderboard, which tracks your
      score, both in Campaign mode and PvP. Compete with your friends, or enemies!<br><br><img

      class="bb_tag"><strong>Class system</strong></h2>After you progress through
      the first 4 missions in the campaign, you are able to choose a class to augment
      your abilites in battle. The classes are non-linear, you can pick and choose
      skills from any class, but you have to focus on a class if you want to get the
      most powerful skills.<br><ul class="bb_ul">   <li>The Mighty Warlord greatly
      increases the effectiveness of your army! He improves the power and abilities
      of your defenders, can unleash the power of stone to help in battle; allowing
      placement of stones to slow nearby enemies, or give you a surge of mana and
      gold. He also has skills which allow your defenders to level up in battle, becoming
      more powerful with each successive rank.<br>   </li><li>The Cunning Treasurer''s
      weapon is gold! He is a master of item storage, able to fit an improbably large
      number of items into his backpack, and find many more scrolls and even potions
      during battles. Everything he does is for gold! He is able to increase bounty
      for enemies killed, make his own defenders cheaper, and eventually can even
      get a powerful spell that allows you to transmute an enemy into pure gold! With
      all of these abilities, the Treasurer can field a much bigger army than any
      other class.<br>   </li><li>The Powerful Sorcerer is able to complete levels
      using only spells! He can bring up to eight spells into battle, increasing flexibilty
      greatly. His skills revolve around buffing spell effectiveness, regenerating
      mana, unlocking more powerful spells, and he can even transform units into mana.
      Among the spells the sorcerer can unlock are: Summon Elemental, Reduction; which
      shrinks and debuffs monsters, Meteor Shower, and Teleportation; which allows
      you to teleport defenders to any available stone on the map.</li></ul>Join the
