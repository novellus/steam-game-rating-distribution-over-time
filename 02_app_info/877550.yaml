      \ Puzzle replicates the experience of putting together a real world jigsaw puzzle.\
      \ The puzzles are free floating and pieces can connect at any location on the\
      \ screen. <br><br>The jigsaw puzzles will come in 16, 64, 256, and <strong>576</strong>\
      \ piece sizes. There are <strong>172 unique</strong> jigsaw puzzles to select\
      \ from making this the <strong>largest</strong> jigsaw puzzle game available\
      \ on Steam. You can also load in custom images into the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Different puzzle modes:</h2><br>The jigsaw puzzles can be played from three\
      \ different modes. <br><br><strong>Table mode</strong> - This mode evenly places\
      \ the starting positions of the pieces across the full table or on the right\
      \ side of the table.<br><br><strong>Swimming Pool Mode</strong> - This mode\
      \ places the starting positions of the pieces into two \u201Cpools\u201D of\
      \ water located on the left and right sides of the screen. The pieces will float\
      \ around allowing for the remainder of the screen to be used to complete the\
      \ puzzle.<br><br><strong> Scroll Mode</strong> -  This mode allows you to cycle\
      \ through different sets of pieces using the right mouse button or arrow keys\
      \ on the keyboard to keep the table from being cluttered.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Game save features:</h2><br>Your last played puzzle will save automatically.\
      \ You may close the game and return at any time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">No paid\
      \ DLC. No exceptions.</h2><br>As a promise from the developer - this game will\
      \ never contain paid DLC or ads. If new puzzles are added then you will receive\
      \ them. If new modes, features, or content is added then you will receive it\

    review: This was a great purchase. It sounds simple, but no other puzzle game/software
      on steam makes custom puzzles so easy. Not everything about this product is
      smooth or user-intuitive, but it lets you import your own pictures and create
      puzzles out of them! To do so, you'll need to go directly to the game files
      and add copies of the pictures. If you love puzzles and want to do virtual puzzles
      with your own pictures, grab this when it's on sale. You won't be disappointed.
