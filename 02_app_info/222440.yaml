      \ BETA TEST END</h1><p>Hey everyone! <br><br>We would like to thank the thousands\
      \ of players all across the world who participated in the beta. Without you,\
      \ this update would not have been possible.<br><br>We have to say though, we\
      \ were very surprised with the amount of feedback we were able to gather in\
      \ this short period. Shortly after the beta went live, we surpassed our previous\
      \ all-time peak of players during the game's launch in *2015*!<br><br>Not only\
      \ that, but in the short amount of time the beta was running, there were even\
      \ a couple tournaments being run for the game as well!<br><br>All in all, this\
      \ was a great success for everyone involved. The community was able to come\
      \ together and teach new players the ropes, while KOF veterans across the globe\
      \ duked it out.<br><br>Heck, maybe even some of you pulled off Geese's Deadly\
      \ Rave mid-match. Whatever the level, we're confident all players had a lot\
      \ of fun during the beta.<br><br>But, all good things must come to an end...<br><br>However,\
      \ the good news is that now Code Mystics are going to focus their time on further\
      \ improving the game to have it in tip-top shape come release.<br><br>We will\
      \ keep everyone posted when the update is going live. Until then, be sure to\
      \ hit up the various KOF discords out there and hone your skills because KOF2002UM\
      \ will be back and ready to go before you know it!<br><br>Again, thank you all\
      \ very much for your support and we look forward to seeing you in-game!<br><br>SNK</p><br><h1>About\
