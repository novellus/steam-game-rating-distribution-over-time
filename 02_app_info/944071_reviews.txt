The size of the buildings require a vast use of (flat!) space and you need a large city population to fill the seats - but you can't have a large city without an educated population. It just doesn't fit.\n\nI was going to uninstall it but I think my new strategy is, start the technical college, build the first tier and forget it, start the arts college, do first tier, forget it, then in the future, buy a new plot of land that has close proximity to the rest of the city because if you build a campus on one side of town and it has capacity for 800 more students, they don't seem interested in taking the subway to attend classes... so why should I keep this in my collection, it's kind of ruined my cities.  I love Park life, I don't like this.","timestamp_created":1609688191,"timestamp_updated":1609688191,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gZK55PYCfpONwAI="}
