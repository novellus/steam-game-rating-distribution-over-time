The blasts come out of your camera, not your hands, making aiming quite awkward. You also can't shoot directly below yourself, instead flinging your blasts at an odd angle. The flying is also strange in VR, but I didn't really give myself a chance to get used to it because the VR experience is terrible.\n\nNot Recommended for VR\nRecommended for casual play","timestamp_created":1610045838,"timestamp_updated":1610057198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm+W47/YCcZiswQI="}
