      \ /><br>This course enables learners to apply knowledge and practice setting\
      \ up a biosafety cabinet (also known as a biological safety cabinet, or BSC)\
      \ in a virtual laboratory. Future updates to this course will allow learners\
      \ to go beyond setup to practice additional skills. Step into a virtual laboratory\
      \ and learn how to work safely in the first-ever Centers for Disease Control\
      \ and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) virtual reality (VR) laboratory training course.\
      \  <br>This course is developed for laboratory professionals and supplements\

      \ page.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>COMING SOON:</strong></h2>CDC is developing\
      \ additional components of this course, such as:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>How\

      \ Safety Cabinets (BSCs) are enclosed, ventilated workspaces designed for safely\
      \ working with pathogens, contaminants, and other potentially hazardous materials.\
      \ A BSC is a primary engineering control used to keep laboratory professionals\
      \ safe by providing a physical barrier and an environmental barrier against\
      \ biohazardous or infectious agents. The BSC helps maintain quality control\
      \ of the material being worked with as it filters both the inflow and exhaust\
      \ air.<br>CDC chose biosafety cabinets as its first VR training topic because\
      \ the proper use of a BSC is a critical laboratory safety issue. The misuse\
      \ of BSCs has contributed to laboratory safety incidents across the country\
      \ and internationally. Also, the current BSC eLearning course has a consistently\
      \ high participation rate and has received positive feedback from learners.\
      \ With  VR technology added to the existing eLearning course, learners can be\
      \ trained on how to use a BSC properly without exposure to pathogens or risk\
      \ of accidental infection or accidental release.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>VR\
      \ NOTE: </strong></h2>This VR course requires a play area of at least 3ft x\
      \ 3ft, but ideally a larger 20 ft x 20ft space to make the experience feel more\
      \ accurate and real.  This VR course also requires a play area with 360\xB0\
      \ tracking. Currently, this course is designed to work ONLY on the HTC Vive\
      \ VR platform. In addition to having the appropriate VR hardware, a learner\u2019\
