It's easy to understand and pick up the mechanics of, and it's fun content. There's sets of worlds, each with a boss at the end that is surprisingly really, really well designed. \nThe only 2 things I don't like about it are; The Fixbots' voices are quite annoying and childish, it's obviously just a filter on a voice to make it more playful but idk. And the horizontal movement speed is kinda slow but hey, very little irks to a good game.","timestamp_created":1594038110,"timestamp_updated":1594038110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8+iEkvMCfu+hkwI="}
