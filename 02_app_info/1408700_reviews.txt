There are no effects, sound development is also not good. I wouldnot have discussed these points if game would be less than 1$. If you are fan of Turkish TV series Like Dirilis Ertugrul and Kurulus Osman then definitely play it but if you are looking for random 3rd person games then skip this.","timestamp_created":1600434447,"timestamp_updated":1609361307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628934085369110107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ415ba2vYCetPHogI="}
