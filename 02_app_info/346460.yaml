    about_the_game: <strong>Vector 36 is  Physics-Based Racer set on the terraformed
      surface of Mars.  You pilot a Skimmer, a completely customizable, surface skimming
      vehicle.  With total control over every component, you are responsible for how
      your Skimmer performs.  Piloting skill and engineering make the difference between
      winning and losing. </strong><br><br>Race other pilots through various tracks
      on Mars.  Compete in Sprint, Circuit, or Tournament modes to win credits, parts,
      or new Skimmers.  Race your friends through Vector 36's amazing ghost replay
      system.  Take on the world with Global Leaderboards.  Push your machine to the
      limits until you are the fastest settler on Mars.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346460/extras/Steam_Desc1.jpg?t=1563160805"

      /><br>Each part of your Skimmer is bound by the laws of physics. Moving internal
      components will shift the center of gravity, adjusting angles to thrusters will
      affect its flight characteristics. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346460/extras/Steam_Desc_Cust.jpg?t=1563160805"
      /> <br>Fine tuning is the difference between winning and losing.  Choose from
      a wide selection of parts, accessories, passive weapons, or support gear to
      adjust your Skimmer to its task. Whether it's a quick sprint at full boost,
      an endurance race with hardened parts, or a hill climb where lift is more important
      than thrust; evolve or get left behind.  <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346460/extras/Steam_Desc_DLC.jpg?t=1563160805"
      /><br>Witness new skimmers, tracks, obstacles, support bots, parts, weapons,
      opponents and game modes. Vector36 will be growing over time. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346460/extras/Steam_Desc_VR.jpg?t=1563160805"
      /><br>Supports HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.  No VR? No problem. Vector 36 still
      plays seamlessly on your PC Monitor.

    review: "been eyeing this a long time, would be a good simple racer candidate\
      \ for my VR machines.\nBut I found it badly optimized and bit too expensive\
      \ for what it is. I'd have bought two if it worked better on the 3770k and rx580,\
      \ but the two lowest graphics settings look ugly as shit (some diamond-esque\
      \ mesh all over the place) and it isn't smooth enough. I could make Elite Dangerous\
      \ run smoother than this actually.\n\nI expected it to run a lot better than\
      \ it does. Open a beta branch where I can choose my own graphics settings and\
      \ not a stupid slider that shits all over the place.\n \nIt works fine on the\
      \ ryzen rig, but not my type of racer, I either buy those twice or not at all.\
      \ Feel free to contact me if there is any optimization update."
