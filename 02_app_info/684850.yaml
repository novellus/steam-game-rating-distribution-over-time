    review: 'This one gets a lot of flak, much of which is rightfully so. The textures
      at the airports are often rather poor and the map is small. The key issue is
      how MUCH of the map is modeled. I get that it is small, that is fine, I mostly
      build small missions anyway (I don''t even use it for WW2 stuff, I play Il2
      for that). I have a problem with the fact that only the area around the French
      coast is completed. There is so much more they could do, I mean there are airports
      on the English side but the coast isn''t complete and it just seems forgotten.


      Anyway, I still give this a positive review because it is a nice change of scenery
      and if you buy it on a sale it isn''t a bad little map to play around with.
      Hopefully they give it some more love in the future despite the popularity of
      the Channel map taking over.'
