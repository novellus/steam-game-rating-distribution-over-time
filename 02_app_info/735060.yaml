    review: The Forbidden Arts is a fantasy themed platform adventure game. The combat
      is pretty old school and simple, which reminds me of a lot of the NES/SNES games
      I played as a kid. However, the boss fights are pretty well designed and are
      the highlight of the game for me. The levels can be somewhat maze like, but
      are pretty easy to navigate. There are collectibles that you use to unlock challenge
      levels, which upon completion, will reward you with extra health. These levels
      seem to be more puzzle based from what I have seen, and are pretty fun. I have
      not beaten the whole game yet, but what I have done has been enjoyable. The
      3d areas are only on the world map, and they simply tie everything together.
      Music is good, sound fx is ok, could be better. Voice acting is kind of annoying
      at times, but the main character is done well. There is a light-hearted Zelda
      vibe, and nostalgia is a real kicker for me in this game. If you are down with
      old school platforming then you will probably enjoy the game like I do. 8/10
