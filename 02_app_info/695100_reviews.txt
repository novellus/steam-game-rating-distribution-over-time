The controls are sometimes challenging, the inventory is always full and picking up items behind other objekts is impossible from time to time. Beside these for me minor problems the game keeps you entertained with a well-constructed storyline, an interesting gameworld and beautiful artwork.","timestamp_created":1609553698,"timestamp_updated":1609553698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519867539405822754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzYu44PYCd4fLvwI="}
