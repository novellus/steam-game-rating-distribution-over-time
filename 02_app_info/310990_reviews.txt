In fact I enjoy teaching him how to play it. I've been looking for something as cool as this gamne for a long time. He comes running to me, dad the robot killed me, halarious. In fact I'm so old school that I love it myself. I switch between Borderlands, Far Cry and the man in a maze! Although I wish they'd make more levels for some hardcore wanna be :).","timestamp_created":1417890687,"timestamp_updated":1417890687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566317379474639893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gd23kMoCeu3IMg=="}
