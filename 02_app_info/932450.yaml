    review: 'Really fun game, nice and dark with a really fun, challenging combat
      system. The gameplay is really solid, with a decent progression curve and there''s
      only one move that becomes kinda redundant late game, the rest are all situationally
      really useful. It really encourages you to think about every move you make,
      and I really got engrossed in playing it. Boss fights feel really epic too,
      with really rad soundtrack!


      Plot wise, I''d say it''s pretty good overall. The initial leap from the protag
      being a harmless nun to a cold-blooded killer does require a bit of suspension
      of disbelief, but the way her character changes over the course of the game
      is really interesting to watch. There''s a cool amount of lore and the characters
      are interesting to interact with.


      All in all, I''d definitely recommend this game. For the price you''re paying,
      you''re getting a fun, challenging, deliciously dark experience with a soundtrack
      that I would honestly pay to get.


      (On that note, creator, if you were to put up the game''s OST for sale on Steam
      or somewhere, I''d absolutely buy it.)'
