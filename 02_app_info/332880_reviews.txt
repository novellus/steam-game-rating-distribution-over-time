The design is bold and has a “new age” feel to it. The gameplay control is very well done, using the mouse was my favorite method of control, and it made the more challenging difficulties, a joy to experience. If you want an addictive game, that also gives you a relaxing time, try DSY out!","timestamp_created":1601221256,"timestamp_updated":1601221256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtKyO6PQCdL+5pAI="}
