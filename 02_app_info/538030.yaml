    about_the_game: '<strong>XENONAUTS-2</strong> is a vast single player strategy
      game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending our
      planet from alien invasion.<br><br>Battle the extraterrestrials in tense, complex
      turn-based combat across a variety of maps and missions, recovering and researching
      their technology to unlock new weapons and equipment! <br><br>Take a global
      view with the real-time strategic management layer: you must establish and develop
      your bases, conduct research, battle for air supremacy and try to keep the panic
      level in your funding regions under control.  <br><br>The strategic and tactical
      layers of the game are directly related, with ground missions affecting the
      overall balance of the Geoscape and your research efforts on the recovered items
      unlocking new equipment for your squads and aircraft. Every management decision
      you make filters down to the troops you control in battle; every shot you fire
      could change the balance of strategic power.<br><br>Can you hold off the invasion
      long enough to discover a way to defeat the alien forces?<br><br><strong>No
      knowledge of the previous game is required to play</strong> - XENONAUTS-2 is
      a standalone title with its own setting and narrative.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key
      Features</h2><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Ground Combat</strong>: The
      highly-detailed turn-based combat system gives you fine control over your soldiers
      as they battle the aliens across multiple different mission types and numerous
      varied environments.  The day / night cycle and destructible battlefields open
      up endless tactical possibilities to defeat your enemies, and your soldiers
      will grow stronger as they gain combat experience - provided you can keep them
      alive!<br></li><li><strong>Strategic Management</strong>: A complex strategic
      layer allows you to coordinate the defence of our planet.  Establish bases to
      extend your reach and use customisable interceptors to shoot down attacking
      UFOs, then deploy your soldiers to secure resources.  Capturing crash sites
      can secure alien technology and live specimens for research, whereas protecting
      regions from alien activity and terror attacks will protect your funding and
      prevent them surrendering to the aliens.<br></li><li><strong>In-depth Simulation</strong>:
      The structure of Xenonauts-2 is not linear; no two campaigns unfold in exactly
      the same way. Every element of this complex interlocking simulation has been
      designed to create maximum coherence between the strategic and tactical layers:
      small decisions can have an impact across the entire game.<br></li><li><strong>Extensive
      Tech Tree</strong>: XENONAUTS-2 contains a vast variety of aircraft, vehicles,
      weapons, armour, and battlefield equipment for you to experiment with. and a
      deep research tree with over a hundred projects to unlock.  Play the game the
      way you want to play, devising your own tactics and strategies to defeat the
      extraterrestrial threat!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Key Improvements from XENONAUTS-1</h2><br><br>In
      addition to the new modular upgrade systems mentioned previously, here is a
      very small selection of key changes and enhancements:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Improved
      visuals across all parts of the game, including full 3D tactical environments
      with a rotatable camera!<br></li><li>A more detailed and immersive Geoscape
      simulation incorporating greater player choice and stronger elements of territory
      control!<br></li><li>More environments and maps to fight in - including our
      new Jungle and Boreal biomes!<br></li><li>New aliens have been added and many
      existing ones have been redesigned, all of which will benefit from our new and
      improved AI system!<br></li><li>A larger research tree with more lore and an
      expanded variety of equipment for your soldiers to use in battle!</li></ul>'
