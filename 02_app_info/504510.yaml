      \ Christian Pacaud from Canada, talented composer Shayne Johnson from Australia\
      \ and composing enthusiast Philipp Fuhrmann from Germany. Being a small group\
      \ of dedicated students with no money to spend on music, we have been blown\
      \ away by quality and love all composers put into their work for the project.\
      \ It has been an amazing journey and we are happy to finally to share some of\
      \ that with you today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are excited to offer the music\
      \ of Divinia Chronicles as a standalone soundtrack, we hope you enjoy it wherever\
      \ you are or travel. While the soundtrack will include many tracks which are\
      \ not included in the game (yet), it is not required to play the game whatsoever.\
      \ Instead, it is supposed to be a way of \u201Cgiving back\u201D to our longtime\
      \ followers and offers new players the chance to \u201Cbuy us a coffee\u201D\
      \ as well (if you do like to do so) :-)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of January 2020\
      \ the soundtrack is converted to the official STEAM &quot;Soundtrack&quot; format\
      \ and will appear in your &quot;Soundtrack&quot; library."
