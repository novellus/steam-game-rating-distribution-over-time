    about_the_game: "What is in the &quot;Way of Gold and Steel&quot; which makes\
      \ it interesting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain reason is the unusual gameplay style\
      \ \u2014 combination of a real-time strategy (RTS) and a roguelike. As you know,\
      \ in a typical RTS you issue global orders \u2014 basically what should be built\
      \ and how to advance through the technology trees. It is different here. You\
      \ control your character like you normally would do in a roguelike. Also you\
      \ issue orders to your followers verbally, participate in fights, you have inventory\
      \ and equipment. As a result we've got a mix of genres: real-time strategy and\
      \ a dungeon crawler, two in one."
