You have to get to the end of the level where a floating human mouth awaits for consumption.\nEveryone hates soggy fries so you have to jump around all kinds of cups filled with liquid. After that you also have to watch out for jello that you can bounce on or cookies and mushroom, that are conscious like you, jumping in your way.\n\nWith a bit of difficulty, and the fact that you are playing as food reminds me of I Am Bread.\nThe difficulty comes from the controls. Although there are just 2 buttons, it's the physics that will get you. You flip around the wrong way and you will go the wrong way. It becomes easy after you get used to it.\n\nThe issues I had is that there was a lot of waiting involved because the energy for movement was charging up pretty slowly. The border around the level also kind of bothered me a little. It really stands out.\n\nHowever, at the end of the game you will get a whole buffet of achievements and the visual style and soundtrack is just amazing just like this developer.\n\n\n[b]If you are looking for Call of Duty then you are at the wrong aisle. This is CALL OF FRIES aisle.[/b]","timestamp_created":1609904793,"timestamp_updated":1609904959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44YX06vYCdIfzwAI="}
