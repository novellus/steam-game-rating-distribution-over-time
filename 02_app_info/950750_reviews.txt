The graphics are pretty nice with relatively unique designs, the gameplay is okay, every ability is varied and gives some spice, but near the end the gameplay is shockingly hard, but not necessarily due to the progressive challenge.  I died a few times because my character was too slow to actually move out of the way of the Dega.  Sound is pretty good, but more than one track would be nice.  Menu's need work, being unable to exit from the main screen is really weird, needs to be fixed.\n\nNot bad for what it is.","timestamp_created":1539395452,"timestamp_updated":1539395452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500990569591522217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxs/HteYCeYXKrAE="}
