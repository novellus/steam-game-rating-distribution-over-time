    reviews: "\u201CAt Bethany Ranch Home we work with a large population of people\
      \ with Down Syndrome, and they love the Beamz Interactive Music System and Jam\
      \ Studio VR, they absolutely love it! There\u2019s some that I didn\u2019t think\
      \ would really be involved, and those are the ones that love it the most. The\
      \ first thing you see when they start playing is a big smile, and it\u2019s\
      \ amazing to see some of my non-verbal people open up and shine. It\u2019s honestly\
      \ like magic, and the smile - they can just go on and on and on and on. It is\
      \ absolutely amazing! One additional great benefit I see is that it surprised\
      \ many of them that they can do it.  A lot of times they\u2019ve been told what\
      \ they can\u2019t do, but this interactive music experience makes them feel\
      \ like they can do anything.  For the short time that they\u2019re doing it,\
      \ they feel like they have no limitations to what they can do.  The experience\
      \ is a 10 out of 10, but honestly, it\u2019s priceless.  It really is.  I\u2019\
      ve seen my group open up and smile and shine - there\u2019s no number you can\
      \ give it, it\u2019s just priceless.     GLORIA Quinn, Assistant Program Manager,\
      \ Bethany Ranch Home\u201D<br />\r\nBethany Ranch Home<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201C\
      Jam Studio VR has been phenomenal as an incentive and a motivator to get our\
      \ students to do things that they\u2019re often uncomfortable or unwilling to\
      \ do, to use as a motivator to get them through the week,and  to simply come\
      \ to school each day so that they\u2019re eligible to participate in the program.\
      \  Having this at the end of our week is a really juicy carrot that encourages\
      \ our students to push through and really grow and develop because they love\
      \ it.  This is a highly motivating, engaging activity for them.  For our students\
      \ who often have fine and gross motor challenges, spatial awareness challenges,\
      \ significant sensory challenges, and impulsivity challenges \u2013 this VR\
      \ App and the process of having them wait in line brings their vestibular and\
      \ other senses into play in order to engage and has been outstanding. It\u2019\
      s a highly discreet way to address all of those deficits for them in a way that\
      \ they\u2019re working harder than they probably would just to have the opportunity\
      \ to do that.  Matt Drowne, Head of Gateway Academy\u201D<br />\r\nGateway Academy<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201C\u201CAs a neurologist and research scientist, I support\
      \ that the possibilities within the Beamz technology are limitless for individuals\
      \ of all ages. From children with developmental disabilities to those facing\
      \ serious life-threatening illnesses, Beamz makes perfect sense. For children\
      \ and adults in rehabilitation, Beamz has extraordinary potential to facilitate\
      \ and accelerate ongoing progress. In the context of senior care, Beamz can\
      \ help older people discover renewed confidence, meaning and value through the\
      \ joy of recreational music making.\u201D  -Barry Bittman, MD \u2013 President\

    review: "Would have loved to have written a helpful review for this, but unfortunately,\
      \ it doesn't work on the Index, regardless of what the listings say. \nHad been\
      \ looking forward to buying this pack for about a year, so when it eventually\
      \ went on sale, I got it. Took over an hour to download, I started it up and...\n\
      \nNothing was clickable, it's just not compatible with the Index. Do not buy\
      \ unless you have the Vive."
