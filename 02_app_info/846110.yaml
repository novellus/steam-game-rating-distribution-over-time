    about_the_game: '<i>A highschool gang leader Ringo Ishikawa trying to live through
      his last autumn before graduation. With his best friends.</i><br><br>You should
      play it if:<br><br>1) You''re fond of good stories with strong dialogues (especially
      about growing up)<br>2) You''re a fight games enthusiast (you''ll get your hands
      on some unique brawl mechanic and I promise you''ll be satisfied)<br>3) You''re
      into some yakuza-delinquent aesthetics<br><br>Basically, the game is an existential
      open world beat''em up with some school sim elements. It has a little of everything:
      a town to explore, day-night cycle, npc on their schedule, battle grinding,
      school grinding, mini-games (ping-pong, billiard, video-poker, video-game console
      with one game...) and so on.<br><br>But the main thing is the story I''m trying
      to tell. And I designed the game to make you feel this story. So it''s not about
      rival gangs, or taking over turfs, or anything. You just live there and feel.
      And that''s all.'
