    review: 'Thank god, finally :) !!! I''ve been waiting 3 years for this particular
      Song Pack and it finally arrived :D ! The first song "I Wish", will take more
      time than the other two in the package (for me). It sounds different in some
      areas but that may be because of single string chords to start off with. "Signed,
      Sealed, Delivered" very close to the actual sound of the song and fun to play.

      And now for the gem!

      "Superstition" absolutely amazing! Spot on even with the single chord sound
      from the start and really works you on that low E string and the A string as
      well as a few quick notes on the B string. Very very well done Ubisoft, you''ve
      actually outdone yourself on this one!


      I''m a beginner player with about a year of experience on Rocksmith and I''ve
      managed to get up to 51.0% on Superstition and plan on learning it by heart
      eventually.  This is one of the funnest songs ever to play and even if you''re
      a fretboard looker like I am, this one will help you to get away from that and
      play by muscle memory alone better than any other song (IMO).
