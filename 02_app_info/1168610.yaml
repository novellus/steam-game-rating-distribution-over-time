      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Ensure the safety of the animals</h2>In Natural Instincts,
      your task is to protect the animals from the dangers of the modern world. Help
      the animals by giving them different kinds of hints. Show them where the food
      or water is, find them a new home or select their prey. Help the animals procreate
      and save them from harm!<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1168610/extras/Six.png?t=1600261016"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore different surroundings</h2>Play in one of six distinct
      environments, each being unique in terms of weather, plants and animals which
      are inhabiting them. Each ecosystem is different and will present you with new
      challenges and missions. Guide the wolves in European forests, save the penguins
      in Antarctica or command the lions in hot Africa - each biome is a new adventure
      to explore! <br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1168610/extras/Guide.png?t=1600261016"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Show them how to survive</h2>Use your powers to teach the
      animals how to avoid harm! Direct them away from the streets, to make them avoid
      the traffic. Make them run away from hunters and save them from natural disasters.
      The animals will learn based on your actions - command them wisely as the balance
      in the ecosystem is fragile. Do not let them go extinct!<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1168610/extras/Help.gif?t=1600261016"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">They need your help</h2>During gameplay, you will face
      many events - save the animals from human influence and disasters such as fires
      or droughts. You can lead the animals to extermination or bring balance and
      multiply their population. It all depends on you!<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1168610/extras/Observe.png?t=1600261016"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Watch their rituals</h2>Different animals mean different
      behaviour that you can observe, while they are mating, eating or even hunting.
      Watch them as their population grows, see how they behave and react, and teach
      them to avoid danger!<h2 class="bb_tag">CHECK OUT MORE FROM GAMES OPERATORS!</h2><a
