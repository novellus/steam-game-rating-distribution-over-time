      \ /><br><br> Long before the Armageddon events, a team of dashing lumberjacks,\
      \ having cut down another bunch of trees (also having drained a few bottles\
      \ of new wine) have decided to relax in the shade of the tree crowns. The wine\
      \ has hit the spot, but alas, the nap did not take its toll.<br><br>\tAfter\
      \ some time one of the strong men pulled out a coin shaped cut of a branch,\
      \ which had been prepared in advance, and loudly declared in a drunken bass:\
      \ \u201CMy King, what are your orders?!\u201D The scene then was followed by\
      \ a booming laugh.<br>\tWhen the laughter had subsided, one of the participants\
      \ took a second wooden coin and nibbled it as if it was made of gold. <br>\t\
      \u201CMy coins of the undead are stronger than yours!  My forces will bite into\
      \ them, and they won\u2019t even get to the battle\u201D \u2013  he completed\
      \ in a thoughtful tone.<br>\t\u201CThen I will play as demons!\u201D \u2013\
      \  picked up the third. All three looked at each other laughing again.<br>\t\
      \u201CLet us play, let\u2019s battle, yes let\u2019s play\u201D \u2013  echoed\
      \ laughter through the trees.<br><br>\tIt would have ended like this, just a\
      \ joke, but the next day, without any arrangements, all three of them would\
      \ bring along a couple of dozens of uneven round coin shaped tokens made from\
      \ a chopped branch.<br><br>\tThey all set down around a stump and looked at\
      \ each other, as if saying \u201Cso, how are we even going to play this?\u201D\
      . And then the Lord of Acorns, holding one of his tokens high, declared that\
      \ his cavalry was advancing on the Undead. With these words, he slammed the\
      \ token on the stump with such force that it let out a creak. <br>        \u201C\
      Now it is your turn of the \u201CUndead\u201D, or yours of the \u201CDemon\u201D\
      , decide for yourself, I\u2019m not afraid of any of you...\u201D - declared\
      \ the first player in a royal tone of utter importance, lifting his head up\
      \ to emphasize his noble origin.<br><br>\tA month later, all the lumberjack\
      \ brigades were already playing the wooden tokens. A little later, the fame\
      \ of a peasants\u2019 small fun game reached the local guild master. There was\
      \ only one problem \u2013 the status did not allow the upper classes to mess\
      \ with the chopped branches. But defeating the hideous werewolves and demons\
      \ using the Golden Templars is of course another matter entirely. Thus the first\
      \ Post Scriptum CTG coins were cast."
