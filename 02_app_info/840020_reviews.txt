I don't mind games being really difficult infact I love them, but when a game isn't that easy to get used with the controls you can't just throw in hardcore levels from the start. There should be a bit of a learning curve not just for 10 to a 100.","timestamp_created":1542109523,"timestamp_updated":1542109523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492028594017028809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w/24hucCe6XYrgE="}
