    about_the_game: "As a kid, speaking doesn\u2019t come easily \u2013 especially\
      \ when you\u2019re lost and looking to find your way home. Booper Get Home!\
      \ is a 2D puzzle platformer in a 3D world in active development for VR, with\
      \ art assets created by a 6 (now 7!) year old on the spectrum.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nPlot:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBooper is your typical kid with a twist: Booper\
      \ doesn\u2019t talk much. Booper likes to play and have fun; except while out\
      \ at the park, Booper gets lost and needs to get back home. Help Booper solve\
      \ puzzles, platform through an expansive, challenging world and explore colorful\
      \ landscapes straight from a child\u2019s imagination. As the game progresses,\
      \ the known world subtly morphs into a wild and fantastical microcosm created\
      \ wholly from the drawings and paintings of the developer\u2019s son. Explore\
      \ multiple levels of whimsy and fun while collecting the items you\u2019ll need\
      \ to help Booper get back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt Style:<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nSince the developer is also a stay at home parent caring for 2 boys, the imagination\
      \ of a child is a powerful lure for making a game. The landscape a kid navigates\
      \ is filled with fantastical beings, heroes, wishes and the day to day stuff\
      \ (including smelly socks!). The art style of a child screams to be animated\
      \ and interacted with: it\u2019s the end goal of any child\u2019s creativity.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDisclaimer: Since this is a game\
      \ geared toward younger players- a gamepad is highly recommended! Booper Get\
      \ Home! is a traditional platformer with a twist: Booper is a 2D character in\
      \ a 3D world (with other 2D characters). The player controls and guides Booper\
      \ to search and find all the items needed to solve puzzles and progress to the\
      \ end goal of finding home. Along the way, Booper will meet many wild and vivid\
      \ characters, avoid traps, pitfalls and dangers, as well as make a friend or\
      \ two!"
