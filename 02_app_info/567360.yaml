    review: "DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!\n\nI understand that it must have\
      \ taken some time to create the O.K background art and generic characters that\
      \ come with this pack but its not very practical and the documentation is not\
      \ beginner friendly at all. There is almost no help in creating your own characters\
      \ if that's even possible, then the entire setup feels forced and really buggy\
      \ with frequent crashing. You cant really edit much from what you see in the\
      \ video and honestly you are going to waste your money getting this because\
      \ in the end you will need to replace most of the irrelevant art which is, I\
      \ guess, a fantasy setting but the characters sort of look modern then there's\
      \ a random desert out of nowhere and a castle with annoying music? \n\nYou are\
      \ better of with Adventure Game Studio, its free and you will have a lot more\
      \ control in actually seeing where your characters go on the map and placing\
      \ objects in the map editor. Don't let this whole \"no programming\" scam fool\
      \ you. Even Unity3D has some Adventure Game plugin if you really insist on using\
      \ drag and drop visual coding or just want to port to multiple devices besides\
      \ windows.\n\nIn short your throwing away 20USD for some unfinished and rushed\
      \ art and I guess ok sound effects, the rest is garbage. \n"
