SPOILERS - takes place on a tiny island yet at one point the cop (johnson) who's from there doesn't know who the island residents who've lived there for multiple generations are. tiny island, yet the bad guys are still able to hide and run around virtually unseen and unrecognized. the only enjoyment i got from this movie was in its (im sure unintentional) comedy. the \"twist\" was obvious from a hundred miles away","timestamp_created":1508098892,"timestamp_updated":1508098892,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525966882705688477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjtzskN8CeOSziAE="}
