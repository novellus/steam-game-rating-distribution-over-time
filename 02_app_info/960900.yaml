      - You cannot use mouse! You can only use keyboard (and controller)! This is
      deal-breaking!

      - No minimap (is extra annoying due to the bad controls on PC)

      - Lack of visual cues (e.g. it is hard to see if soldiers are enemies or allies)


      I am probably not gonna play this game again, but I will still recommend it
      since I want to support the RTS genre and indie studios'
