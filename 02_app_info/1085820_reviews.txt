There are 2 major problems when it comes to interacting with objects and kayaking controls - let's just say the game is not very responsive. Essentially it's a walking simulator, there are a few different segments like walking, riding a car, and kayaking - almost like an interactive cutscene. The game can be completed around 1 hour, there were a few forks in the river but I think they all lead to the same place. Kayaking is the biggest portion of the game, and surprisingly you can leave your boat and swim around, but I wish the developer would take advantage of that by adding some optional exploration. The game has a lot of cool visual transitions, some of them I have never seen done before, without going into spoilers, I'll just say that it was very creative. Please don't take this negative review out of context, I think there are many good ideas here, the artist just needs to find someone to help him with programming. Serious talk here, if this game was very polished and had more content, it would be one of my favorites, so much potential. Oh and one more thing, this experience works best when there is music in the background, but the game was lacking sound effects and music in some areas.\n\nUpdate: The game has been somewhat improved, but it still has too many clunky parts to recommend in good faith. But hey, thx to the dev for the fixes, and if you want to support an interesting game with some issues, perhaps give it a try if the price is right.\n\n [/i]","timestamp_created":1582505496,"timestamp_updated":1583223415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588969528675079346","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jYTez/ACdNac9AE="}
