Now I will answer this criticism. \nYes, we once again start as a shaper in training. Yes, once again, a new Geneforge is under construction and there's the rebellion. Frakons survived the ending of G2 and now wage war on the mainland with help from free serviles and traitorous Shapers. But, the game takes place on remote Ashen Isles. We travel from one to another, getting closer and closer to the new Geneforge and its creator. Some fans disliked that and I get where they are coming from. In previous games we had one big map, while G3 has small, separate island each with problems of its own (rebelling commoners, full enemy control, traitors and spies etc.). But, I think this only helped diversify the plot. We are constantly on the move meeting new characters and facing new challenges, almost like a road movie. It is also no shorten then G1 taking me 45.1 hours on first walkthrough. Another ctiticism of the game is it having only two sides to choose from: loyalists and rebels. But, I was OK with that. I'd rather have to best faction in the saga, then some 4 or 5 average ones. The gameplay didn't change much but there are new features like crafting and human companions. \nOverall, Geneforge 3 is a great addition to the franchise and I don't get why so many people dislike it.","timestamp_created":1602562856,"timestamp_updated":1603042998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw796znvUCdebIpwI="}
