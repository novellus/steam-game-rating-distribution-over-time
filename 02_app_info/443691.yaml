    about_the_game: <strong><i>Winter Is Here...</i></strong> Go deeper into the underground
      caverns, challenging the frozen depths as you search for new materials to advance
      your technology in the first expansion pack for Fortresscraft Evolved.  Within
      the interior of this rugged and unforgiving environment you will find new ores
      and crystals needed to design advanced weapons, suit upgrades and energy production
      machines.  Energy is the key to survival and ultimate victory...mastering these
      elements will prove essential to escaping the planet.<br><br>But who said survival
      would be easy?  Thawing the cold caverns into a livable environment has awoken
      a long slumbering alien menace, the Cryoplasm spores.  Now hungry to feed off
      the new source of heat and energy they collectively creep their way toward your
      base, devouring any machinery in their path.  Only a new grade of flame weaponry
      can hold off their attack, but can you develop the technology and resources
      in time?<br><br>The Frozen Factory will add 100s of hours of expanded single
      and multiplayer gameplay to the FortressCraft universe and includes these new
      features:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Go deeper into your environment than

    review: The base game is very lacking and I bought this thinking that it might
      add just what the game needs. But it doesn't. In the base game, the late stages
      become really grindy and boring and this expansion just adds more of the same
      grind. I strongly suggest you don't buy this unless you completed the base game
      and really want more of the same.
