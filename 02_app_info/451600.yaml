    review: Rock-solid shmup mechanics with hidden layers of complexity.  Hundreds
      of "attachment" powerups with dazzling combinations - some overpowered, and
      some ridiculous.  Each of seven heroes has a special ability that encourages
      experimentation and diversity.  Local co-op and network play elevate this to
      a hidden masterpiece.
