If the whole market (all 4 sectors go down) you should be judged on the delta between your losses and the market losses. So if the market goes down 20% but you only lose 5% you had a 15% \"gain\". To get fired because the market goes down is not realistic\n\n2. The penalties of taxes and hacking your bank are way out of balance. If within your first few years you get one of those down economic years you won't have enough money to upgrade your bank, without getting to the crypto level you can't make enough money to counter the hacking. This is really the biggest flaw that makes the game unplayable. I've played through about 3-4 times now and I'm done.","timestamp_created":1593711466,"timestamp_updated":1593711466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4eKmiPMCeaegkgI="}
