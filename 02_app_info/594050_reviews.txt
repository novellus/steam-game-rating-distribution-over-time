My overall impression is that there is a decent game that just can't get past all the jank.  The game can't make up it's mind if it wants to be a 2010's era cinematic shooter or an arcade blaster.\n\nThe story and presentation is good enough.  Mad scientist takes over city.  Oppressive regime makes mulch out of the locals.  You get to do something about it.\n\nInventory is kind of puzzling.  There is no clean categorization of which guns go into which slots.  You start off with the baton and pistol, which is well and good.  Then you get the Tec 9, which sits in slot 3 but uses pistol ammo.  Then you find the m4...which replaces the Tec 9 for some reason.  There's no real rhyme or reason as to which guns go where.  Nor is there any to the various accessory loadouts you find on guns.\n\nLevel layout doesn't know what it wants to be in a lot of cases.  There are lots of winding linear corridors for cinematic shooting.  Then you have large open areas, which kind of goes against the stealth angle routinely being pushed by the story.  The vehicle section feels entirely unnecessary.  The stealth sections feel forced given the gun play.\n\nThe gun play is a real mixed bag at best.  The game forces you to aim down sights in order to hit anything.  The blur effect is blinding on a lot of guns.  Most enemies are painfully spongy and can eat ammo by the mag.  This makes ammo use and management a problem.  Reloads are painfully slow.  Ammo is surprisingly scarce.   Shooting enemies don't actually drop as much ammo as it takes to kill them.\n\nThe ending fight really soured the game for me.  It highlights a lot of what the game does wrong: poor feed back, gun play that's a mushy mess, and arenas that don't work for what they are intended to do.  Without this part, I could have just said \"yeah, it's a janky budget shooter,\" but I'm hesitant to recommend after that.","timestamp_created":1609556465,"timestamp_updated":1609556465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41tLC4PYCcKPMvwI="}
