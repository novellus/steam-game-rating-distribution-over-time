      \ They warped off the road to shorten the route to camping. Unfortunately, their\
      \ car broke down on the way. They were waiting a long time for any help and\
      \ then decided to take life in their own hands. Since then, they have been stuck\
      \ with each other and put to test of survival in extreme conditions. A very\
      \ hard task awaited Will, who would not only take care of himself but also of\
      \ his disabled father.  <br><br><strong>Crafting </strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1444540/extras/ognisko-dlugie-fast.gif?t=1608293164\"\

      \ the game, you will have to look for solutions and create new objects to store\
      \ resources. During extremely cold nights, you will have to make a fire that\
      \ will keep you warm. Only in this way you can be in good shape to continue\
