    review: 'An instant Childhood Classic, in which you explore the Jungles with Buzzy
      the Knowledge Bug in this Third & Final Installment of the Junior Field Trips
      series. As you already know, there are 3 kinds of Jungles in the known world:
      Asian, Amazon & African each with its own ecosystem.


      There''s so much to see & do in the Jungles, there''s animals & wildlife to
      see plus so much more. There''s over 30 places to explore & a built-in encyclopedia
      with 256 items, a coloring book & minigames to play.


      It brings out the animal inside you with learning in Let''s Explore the Jungle.'
