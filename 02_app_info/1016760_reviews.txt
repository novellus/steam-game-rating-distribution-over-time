The first was such a wonderful nostalgia trip that had big Earthbound vibes and even moments that literally took pages from the game (such as the continuous cop battles to recruit the Cop).  It was just such a great game, and I was really equally excited to play a game like that set in space.\n\nSadly, like some other reviewers, I can't.\n\nUpon loading the game and wanting to tweak the settings, I found that the game freezes the moment I hit settings...or at least the graphics themselves just suddenly stop since I can hear the movements from if I moved on the controller/keyboard, but the graphics are frozen onto the main menu screen.  Resetting the game or even my computer doesn't help this, and it happens every time I try to load the game and hit the settings, and I'm forced to force-close via Alt-Ctrl-delete just so the game doesn't continue clocking time.\n\nIf that's not bad enough, while the game itself will load after hitting New game and it seems like the Settings menu crash is the only problem...we then cut to the next problem: Shortly after you're allowed to move on your own, I go to talk to an NPC...any NPC.  Much like that first issue, the game suddenly crashes/freezes right there.  I can still hear the dialogue from the NPC and can probably move around, but once again I can't actually see what I'm doing because the graphics have decided to freeze right at that moment I clicked to talk, and stay that way until I force-close the same way as before so that the game doesn't accrue time during that frozen state since the game is still running.\n\nFrom what I've read in the bug thread, this has been an issue reported back as far as barely a day or so after the game initially released, and has never been fixed because it apparently only affects some users and not all.\n\nAnd apparently I'm just unlucky enough to be one of those users that it does affect...though a year+ later you'd think they'd have gotten that bug figured out and taken out.\n\nBut alas, they haven't.  So while some may be able to play this game with no problems, fair warning that some of you who purchase this may run into that same graphical issue that will literally make the game unplayable for you.","timestamp_created":1605275232,"timestamp_updated":1605275372,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnsn34PUCeoyPrgI="}
