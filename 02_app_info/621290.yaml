    review: "Watch my video here https://youtu.be/ezcmqAKCMnA\nPlay on the Rift S\
      \ (marked as non supported but works well) \nGraphically it's pretty. The scale\
      \ of the gun/rifles are over sized. The animations are poor. \nAudio is poor.\
      \ Guns and Rifle all sound off plus they sound weak. \nGameplay shine on on\
      \ arcade as arcade is full on chaos with leaderboards and this adds alot of\
      \ fun. Story was slow and not so much fun. \nThe price of the game on sale at\
      \ 40% off is about right. At full price it's OK, but then I would be thinking\
      \ of other wave shooters starting to get into that price range. This would lose\
      \ out to say Rest in Pieces or something. \n"
