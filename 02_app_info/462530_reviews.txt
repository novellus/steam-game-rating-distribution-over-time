While the photogrammetry-produced human models ARE impressive, they don't do much. The four minute-to-two-minute-long vignettes are all basically the same; the gladiator scene has an actor standing around, the wasteland scene has an actress standing around, the mountain scene has an actor crouched down, and the boxing scene has two (!) actors standing around. A fifth scene is present in the trailer but is not in this demo; featuring a model during a photo shoot, I can't imagine I'm missing much. For such little content, it takes an absurd amount of space (8 gb at the time of this review, so roughly 1 gig per minute of content).\n\nThe boxing scene is perhaps the most disappointing as it's the featured scene in the trailer. The coach repeatedly phases in & out of scene (likely due to multiple takes), and they use different footage from his audio track in the second half, breaking the immersion. Speaking of breaking immersion, this should be a seated experience as walking away from the center of the play area makes it look like the coach is talking to an invisible person and the boxer is fighting a ghost.","timestamp_created":1486893837,"timestamp_updated":1486893837,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rO3xmNoCcbr4cQ=="}
