    review: "Right now especially for this price this game is crap!!! I do NOT recommend\
      \ this! I can't find any reason why this should be an innovative concept in\
      \ education? It is a very simple Jump 'n Run game with worst controls, which\
      \ are not customizable or with the support of common controllers.  But it's\
      \ not only simple, du to the terrible controls, precise jumps are nearly impossible.\
      \ And these are often at the end of a level, when you die you have to do the\
      \ whole boring level again... \U0001F92C\n\nFrom time to time you have to answer\
      \ some simple questions to turn off some laser beams or so. Not really educational,\
      \ I think. For this money, you can buy a beginners book about programming and\
      \ create the game yourself - for example with scratch or python. Obviously in\
      \ 1 hour with a book you can learn a lot more about the fundamentals of computer\
      \ programming than with this game - and enjoy your favourite games afterwards.\
      \ \U0001F579\n\nThe only good thing on this \"game\" is the cute design of the\
      \ bunny robot.\n\nDear developers, I'm looking forward that you bring updates\
      \ to turn this into the promised educational gem. \nMaybe you can let the player\
      \ find code-lines hidden in the world and you can use them to learn new functions\
      \ like jumping, shooting (shooting upwards to destroy these annoying cameras\
      \ that'll attack you), create bridges, control enemies or to automate more stuff.\n\
      \nI will follow this game and hope the best for this game - and if it is what\
      \ it should be, than it will receive my best rating!!!\nGood Luck!"
