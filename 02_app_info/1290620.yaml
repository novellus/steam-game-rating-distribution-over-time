    about_the_game: '''Member the Alamo? is a VR shooter loosely based on the historic
      battle that birthed Texas. You will fight alongside larger-than-life heroes
      William Barrett Travis, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett, and his trusty gun Betsy as
      you defend the Alamo from Santa Anna and his Mexican army that outnumber you
      100 to 1. This isn''t your pappy''s Alamo though as you will switch back and
      forth between the siege defense levels and HILARIOUS SKITS that will influence
      the next day''s battle. ''Member the Alamo? is one of the first serialized video
      games where you will tune in periodically to see what zany things these heroes
      are getting into and how their antics affect the next day''s battle. <br><br><img

      /><br><br>''Member the Alamo? has smooth locomotion and over 100 A.I. enemies
      at once. You must prevent the enemies from scaling the walls with their ladders
      which can be physically pushed over, while also monitoring the damage of the
      fully destructible walls. The odds are overwhelming, but with the help of your
      A.I. companions you can become a hero of the Texas revolution and be ''Membered
      for ages. Nothing snooty here, just good old fashioned video gamey fun. That''s
      what Blue Collar Games is all about-- games made by men with calluses on their

    review: This game is smack yo mamma good. I haven't laughed this hard at a video
      game since, well ever. The action portion of the game is also really intense
      with more enemies in VR than any other VR game I've played. If you want to play
      a game that reminds you of the simpler times when games only cared about being
      fun, this is the game for you.
