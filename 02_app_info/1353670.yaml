    review: "HEAR ME OUT: Gave this game benefit of the doubt because I wanted to\
      \ test out if this would be a good game to suggest to my friends. BUT if you\
      \ want me to get my friends to play this game. I would like to suggest. \n1.\
      \ mini tutorial on the controls. OR  show the controls on the screen please.\n\
      2. using shift e to throw the item is kind of awkward, maybe 'F' key?. \nOR\
      \ \n3. Allow us players to customize our keys.\n4. Single player doesn't work.\
      \ I see there is another character there but there is no indicator key to switch\
      \ to that person, after seeing another review say the button to switch was Tab,\
      \ was still difficult to play.\n5. For single player the blocks move a little\
      \ too fast on the conveyor, running back and forth throwing. I lose more points\
      \ than earning (possibly an easy, medium, hard levels in the future?).\n6. The\
      \ layout design concept of the game is simple, easy to navigate through, which\
      \ I appreciate so please keep that for the future. \n7. Possibility of having\
      \ more than just 2 co-op players. Maybe 4? handling one color each or two colors\
      \ each. who knows just some ideas\n8. having controller compatibility?\n\nOverall\
      \ I still want to give this game a chance. The idea of the game and it's co-op\
      \ mechanics is simple enough to recommend to many of my friends. Been looking\
      \ for co-op games and this one really has potential , however still needs major\
      \ improvements. For a single developer / indie game its really well made. Obviously\
      \ the game still needs time to be worked on.\n\nI will change my review when\
      \ I see the next major update. and as well give that update a fresh start for\
      \ the game."
