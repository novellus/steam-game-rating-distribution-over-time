    review: '+Interesting concept

      +Cheap


      -Badly implemented

      -Some levels nearly impossible

      -Repetitive

      -Axe throwing a little wonkey


      2/5


      Could be good, but has bad controls, worse physics and in the long-run is executed
      poorly enough that it''s just not entertaining.
