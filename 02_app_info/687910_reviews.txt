It adds 4 different skins for your workers. There is a lot of skins that you can unlock by progressing the game and getting all the achievements, but nevertheless this is a welcome addition for true fans of the game. All the new models look great in my opinion, especially the pumpkin-head and the easter bunny. It is relatively cheap and totally worth it, but if you want to wait for the discount it goes for less than 50 cents.\nI know that the devs are done with this game, but I would love to see more new skins every now and then.","timestamp_created":1572387716,"timestamp_updated":1598741179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525084495544433594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p82ZnvQCcq2a1QE="}
