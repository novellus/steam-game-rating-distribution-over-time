I love the building up of an empire but dislike games where the combat is too simple. \n\nThis game is visually beautiful and when the Eclipse comes the entire landscape darkens adding to the atmosphere of your empire beings stalked by Pandora's natives. The factions are limited in number (I'd like a few more). The technological progression is interesting. \n\nThe combat is unusually better than the standard one-on-one combat seen in Civ type games for a number of reasons: \n1. The unit variety is actually quite large. There are biological units, human ones and mechanical ones. They come in large and small, terrestrial, aerial and water-based. \n2. Customisation multiplies this variety by allowing you to create ranged artillery, offensive, defensive and special-type units. \n3. The designers have added a the ability to have combined arms with ranged combat, and to have other friendly units adjacent to the enemy assist in attack or defense. This is usally overlooked by designers of Civ type games (preumably because it takes alot of effort to develop) but in my view is a 'must-have\". \n4. Units can stack, yet there are mechanics which can counter and deter stacking. \n5. Then there is the effect of terrain which has an enormous impact on combat. And these effects vary with the type of unit.\n\nIt seems to me the developers of this game have gone out of their way to create something that appeals to the tactical and strategic wargamer, not just the civilisation builder.\n\nThis is a fully developed game and I think it is worth the price, the DLC being essential. I would love to see further development of this game. It is very unusual and very good.","timestamp_created":1550537691,"timestamp_updated":1550537691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610578954219818115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49/HPgekCefOiuwE="}
