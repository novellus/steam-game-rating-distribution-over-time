It has a nice little story which I won't talk about but I can say that it's quite easily predictable.\n\nPros:\n- short little game for small price (even tho 5 Euro could b 2 much for some people)\n- scary game, sometimes predictable jumpscares with loud af noise but they worked on me\n- nice voice actors (except skinny and fat baldie lol)\n- nice little puzzles which were quite easy to solve, if you were lookin around the house (except the safe section)\n- good performance, no crashes (duh, imagine fps drops with such game)\n\nContra: \n- clunky movement\n- unfortunate camera placement during 'cutscenes'\n- jumpscares r way tooooo loud at times\n- predictable (yet nice little) story\n- very short game (60-80 minutes if you r as slow and scared as me)\n- NO SETTINGS?\n\nNeutral:\n- funny, slow, clunky character animations (got me laughing a lot, thx for that)\n- simplistic low budget graphics but I didnt care about that, otherwise I would've not bought the game","timestamp_created":1608636239,"timestamp_updated":1608636835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y8SOxfYCec+TvAI="}
