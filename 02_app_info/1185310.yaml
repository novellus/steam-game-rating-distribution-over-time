      notes: "The game contains cartoon violence, as well as dismemberment and use\
        \ of many weapons including guns, knives, rocket launchers and many more potentially\
        \ violent ones, will be added.\r\n\r\nPunching, throwing and smacking enemies\
        \ is also possible as well as using cat paws to damage.\r\n\r\nThere isn't\
        \ any blood, just white or black ink being spilled on hits, but some might\
        \ see it as a blood-like liquid or cartoon blood."
