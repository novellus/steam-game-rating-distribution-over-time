If you don't have your saves in order OR manage to get past some other way just before the moment things go fubar in the script then you are finished. \n\nLovely game otherwise and yet again a title that stretches the limit of the old rpgmaker engine but this one didn't quite do enough QA before release so a clear negative it is.","timestamp_created":1607862002,"timestamp_updated":1607862002,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533898293972015381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwleSCrvYCfv7nuQI="}
