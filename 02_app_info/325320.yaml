    review: 'This game is VERY enjoyable, for the older people og people with higher
      intelligence. The combat system, is good, and despite what quite a few people
      say, it is easy, if you know how to use the different skills toward different
      enemies. And for God''s sake: use ''GUARD'' action.. You replenish your action
      points and your health as well as you get a defence bonus for the 1 turn used
      on it (i think) It makes all the difference. I love the game, actually, the
      story is very intriguing, it is lovably oldschool, the graphics is dated, but
      how many people love games that are dated graphically? MANY, all say the dont
      make games as they used to. And that is true. And this game, is a great one.
      Niche for sure, but I like games that are investigating and requires the player
      to use his or her mind on this. And you have to use your head on this game.
      I really love it, it is a great RPG, and within the Chtulu mythos, it aint to
      many proper Lovecraft games out there, but this is one. RECOMMENDED! OH and
      Kudos to RPG GAMEMAKER, i guess Mythos: The Beginning is made in either VX or
      MV, it is a great programming software, and this game does the gamemaker real
      credit.'
