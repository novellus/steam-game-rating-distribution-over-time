It fits that comforting spot very well. I can play a few rounds while other stuff is happening around me in the house. As an older game it's also at the right price. I have never been a graphics obsessive, but to me these graphics have an old-school style, but work fine on my <1yr old Windows gaming laptop, and I never have trouble working out what a particular tile is. The game structure is an elegant idea with not too many pieces, where the pieces combine well to create lots of interesting variation. \n\nThere's things you can nitpick. The achievements aren't linked with Steam. The strangest design choice, to me, is that everything is completely turn based (making it a great game for partial attention or when being interrupted), except for one key phase in every round, which has a ten second timer. I think they made a mistake here, and it would have been better to have no \"race\". But it's a quibble. It's a fun game; soothing, but not so much it puts you to sleep.","timestamp_created":1608371066,"timestamp_updated":1609325699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+6vS2fYCeqyyuwI="}
