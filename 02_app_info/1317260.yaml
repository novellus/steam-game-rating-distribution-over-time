    detailed_description: '<h1>FAQs</h1><p><strong>Will this addon affect my performance?</strong><br>SAM
      AirportVehicles is highly tuned for performance and due to the intelligent drawing
      logic it won''t have any additional performance impact. If your system is struggeling
      with big airports like KSEA Seattle for example, it obviously won''t get better
      but not worse either.<br><br><strong>Is this a ground service addon?</strong><br>Definitely
      not. It''s a vehicle replacement tool which means it replaces the default art
      assets by Laminar Research with custom HD and PBR objects. Additionally our
      regional system draws different types of vehicles depending on the region your
      are.<br><br><strong>Are the vehicles animated?</strong><br>Yes, they drive around
      with rotating wheels like the default X-Plane vehicles do. As X-Plane doesn''t
      give us a chance to read out other animations like lifting baggage belts or
      similar, those effects are not animated.<br><br><strong>Are the static vehicles
      being replaced too?</strong><br>Yes they will based on our 3 regions Asia, Europe
      and North America (+ fallback).<br><br><strong>What if I''m flying outside a
      defined region?</strong><br>No worries, you will be able to enjoy the HD vehicles
      even if you are outside of a predefined region. It will always fallback to our
      North American vehicle set.<br><br><strong>Why are the vehicles driving like
      crazy?</strong><br>As we only replace the default vehicles they behave exactly
      the same as before. The default driving logic can be strange sometimes. Vehicles
      can run into each other or stop out of a sudden for no obvious reason. We hope
      Laminar will improve that in the future as it is out of our scope.<br><br><strong>How
      can I add custom vehicle liveries or objects?</strong><br>Please refer to the
      Developer Guide.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Make your X-Plane world even
