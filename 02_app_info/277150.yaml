    review: 'this software does not do what i thought it would, or at least not the
      way i want it to.  i was hoping for a program that functioned similar to pro
      tools, but not for $700 like pro tools. you can record, but if your looking
      to record vocals over an mp3 file it is possible, but you have to use an external
      program say like itunes or windows media player.  then you have to take the
      mp3 and import it into MAGIX and line the files up. so, it''s not impossible,
      just a pain in the ass. nothing like spending $100 dollars on software only
      to find out it doesnt really operate in a logical manner. i should have bought
      Mixcraft 6.


      *UPDATE*

      so after several emails between tech support and myself Magix has given me a
      key to Samplitude, which is what i should have bought in the first place. i
      did play around with audio & music lab and it is good software if what you need
      is a single track editing solution. i found it really easy to use. but my real
      focus here is not so much the software at this point, but more so the developer.  i
      made a mistake, and they knew that i was unhappy with the mistake that -> i
      <- made. they went out of there way to make me happy, or atleast thats how they
      made me feel. they gave me a key for the proper software free of charge and
      i get to keep (or atleast I''m assuming I do) the original software.  now a
      days i feel that is an uncommon thing, i feel that MAGIX really cares about
      their customers.  i can tell by the way that they treated me that they put there
      hearts and souls into their software, if i need other software in the future
      i will be buying their''s over a competitor''s for sure.'
