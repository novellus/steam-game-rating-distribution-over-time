And, yes, RNG might necessitate a seed re-roll, but that's hard to be mad about if you've only lost ten minutes by the time you recognize the problem.\n\nHowever, all of the decisions you make in this game are fundamentally 4X. Do I expand and stretch myself thin, or make my existing domain more robust? Do I build out my military to earn points through combat, or just double-down on research to earn points through completing the tech tree? Mini Gal4Xy delivers the 4X experience in a bite-sized package, without the accompanying feeling that you're missing out on the \"real\" game because you don't have the time for or interest in devoting weeks or months of your life to hundreds of hours of a marathon campaign.\n\nI wish there were more games like this.\n\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1609598964,"timestamp_updated":1609635347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o8fv4vYCeMvfvwI="}
