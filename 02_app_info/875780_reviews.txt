The questions are ok, but there is no option to choose category of questions, and the timer is far too short (10 seconds) with no way to pause or extend timer. As another reviewer pointed out, questions also started to repeat themselves after only a few minutes of gameplay - it raises doubts on the claim of having \"thousands of questions\". Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it enough to keep it in my library and have requested a refund.","timestamp_created":1577944179,"timestamp_updated":1577947966,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo+XBsu8CduyR6QE="}
