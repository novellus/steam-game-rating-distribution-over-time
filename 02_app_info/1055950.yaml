    review: "This early access game has 14 endings already. The storyline is nonlinear\
      \ and there are tons of path to choose from. What is fun is that any action\
      \ you take can change the whole adventure. The difficulty is quite balanced,\
      \ hard but fair. I\u2019d recommend this game to anyone who likes challenging\
      \ RPGs and rich stories."
