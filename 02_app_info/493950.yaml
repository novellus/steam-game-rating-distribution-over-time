    review: 'Though this DLC more or less just exists to give another avenue to get
      money to the devs if you felt Thea was a great experience, you do get something
      in return: 243 art cards, which are the in game assets used for every character,
      party member and monster during the card battles. Each card is an 825x1125 jpg
      at 72dpi, so pretty good quality. Could be useful for people who run tabletops!'
