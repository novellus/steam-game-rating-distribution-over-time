The art style I'm a big fan of, the shooting mechanics have that old flash game vibe that I also like, the inventory and gear system are pretty cool. As a kid, I remember playing Zombotron 2 and one so far, is not very different from the second. So for me, it has sentimental value. I would recommend this game to anyone who might be on the fence about purchasing this game. It's def worth a shot if you like side-scrolling shooters.","timestamp_created":1609925506,"timestamp_updated":1609925506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvbbC6/YCcfP5wAI="}
