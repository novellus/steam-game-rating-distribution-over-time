    review: "EPILEPSY WARNING: THIS GAME HAS FLASHING LIGHTS\n\nIt has potential,\
      \ but I can't recommend it game right now.\n\nFirst things first, if you wanna\
      \ understand this game, you need to know his shenanigans (google \"bob's game\"\
      ). \nDespite all that, the game is... Interesting.\n\nThe game is basically\
      \ a \"crossover\" of several puzzle games, like Puyo Puyo, Columns, and Super\
      \ Puzzle Fighter. You can either select them individually or play it on a set\
      \ order, each game being its own \"stage\". That's a quite solid concept, but\
      \ there are quite a few tecnical problems in this game\n\nFirst, visuals. The\
      \ neon pieces are quite nice, but the problem lies outside the puzzle grid.\
      \ There is a huge cluster of information concentrated outside of the grid on\
      \ the left side of the screen. These  are huge lines of text (for an UI) with\
      \ precise statistics. Things for a casual viewer, like number of lines, whith\
      \ also numbers I've only heard being used by hardcore puzzle players, like current\
      \ gravity and lock delay. I don't mind the quantity of information presented\
      \ on screen, but I can see someone having a problem with that not being presented\
      \ in text. It kinda looks like a debug build, Just text, mind you, nothing even\
      \ remotely close to the aesthetics of the rest of the game. It's ugly and distracting.\
      \ It is completely possible to have these statistics displayed in a more aesthetical\
      \ way than this games shows right now. There there is so much text and information\
      \ that,  if you're playing in the default windowed mode, four of those options\
      \ will be hidden (I'll get to that in a second). \n\nMy second biggest problem\
      \ is actually ironic, considering the last paragraph. This game has the habit\
      \ to not telling what are you supposed to be doing in each segment. It probably\
      \ helps that I played most of these puzzles, but there are a few games that\
      \ are not self-explanatory (notably Super Puzzle Fighter). There are items on\
      \ the game that I don't have the slightest clue on how they work. For example,\
      \ the Pacman icon. What does it do? I have no clue. It doesn't work like in\
      \ Pac Attack, because I can eliminate all the blocks present, and even then\
      \ Pacman doesn't move (btw, Namco might sue you for using a Pacman, there's\
      \ precedent for that). There are a few items on the first puzzle that I took\
      \ a while to understand what they were doing, because the name of the information\
      \ flashes rapdily on screen, giving me not enough time to process. \n\nThere's\
      \ also no training mode, or any other outside of \"marathon\" or \"endless\"\
      , which... Actually, I have not that much of a problem with that, the quantity\
      \ of games inside Bob's Game is a lot of content already (I kinda wish there\
      \ was a \"random\" mode, with a randomly generated order of \"stages\"). \n\n\
      And I will not try to use multiplayer because... Come on, Pelloni, you're asking\
      \ too much from me. People are questioning the validity of this game enough,\
      \ and you're asking people to register for online multiplayer? Come one, man.\n\
      \nBut I would urge the author to not worry with extra features right now. Because\
      \ this game is, above all,  collection of tecnical misteps. The game behaves\
      \ differently based on the size of the windows, with information either missing\
      \ or being relocated (and, need I remind you, this game opens in a small window\
      \ by default). The transitions between games are very clumsy, without any kind\
      \ of warning. The game loves using flashing lights as substitutes for more elaborate\
      \ animations, which oh boy do I have a headache right now. Trying to vote basically\
      \ softlocks the game with an error informing me the game cannot connect into\
      \ the server. The menus are clumsy and look really bad. There's a wall of text\
      \ on the title screen, with the author shilling his Patreon and other information\
      \ (I'm not against Patreon, I'm against wall of texts polluting the UI). Scrolling\
      \ is a mess, most notably in the tetris attack segment.\n\nWith all that said,\
      \ this game has a lot of potential. The game sure needs a lot of work into it,\
      \ but it is very possible to turn itself into a excellent puzzler. \nAnd its\
      \ playable at least. That's a lot more than I can say about, for example, Tetris\
      \ Ultimate."
