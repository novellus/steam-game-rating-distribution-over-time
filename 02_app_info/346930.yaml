      \ TURN THE HILLS RED. </h2><br>Deadhold is a gore infused, fast-action, tactical\
      \ RTS. With support for up to 4 coop players, the gritty dark fantasy world\
      \ of Deadhold comes to life through its story driven campaign. In multiplayer,\
      \ Deadhold supports up to 8 players in teams or 4 players in free for all, and\
      \ a variety of game modes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> A NEW KIND OF RTS </h2><br>Deadhold\u2019\
      s gameplay is a unique mix of real-time tactics essentials like strategic positioning,\
      \ unit classes, and physically based simulation similar to such classic games\
      \ as Myth and Dawn of War 2, combined with the items, loot, and leveling found\
      \ in action RPGs like Diablo and Path Of Exile. The result is a fresh take on\
      \ the tactical RTS that should delight fans of both RTS and ARPG genres.<br><br>Battles\
      \ in Deadhold are physically modeled. The flight of an arrow is realistically\
      \ simulated and will embed inside a units head, arms, legs or chest. Unit movement\
      \ is based on physics, increasing the value of tactical positioning: A line\
      \ of warriors can block incoming enemies or force them to engage or go around.\
      \ The explosive bomb wielded by the Sapper can literally dismember units as\
      \ body parts explode and fly into the air. Injuries and severed limbs stain\
      \ the ground realistically with blood.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CAMPAIGN</h2><br>A\
      \ dark force has risen in the west, obliterating any who stand in its wake.\
      \ The last living races have banded together to change the course of fate, setting\
      \ Deadhold's campaign in motion. Told from the perspective of the narrator,\
      \ you'll uncover the history of the blight, and the truth that lies behind their\
      \ creation. The 16 mission campaign challenges you to wield the power of the\
      \ gods, using tactics and strategy to overcome the onslaught of an overwhelming\
      \ evil force.<br><br>In campaign, the scale of Deadhold\u2019s player choice\
      \ becomes clear. As a paragon of the Empire, players will choose a Deity in\
      \ which to specialize. Spells are unlocked as players earn experience, allowing\
      \ them to customize their play style. Players can further customize their builds\
      \ by slotting relics, runes, and gems, which can drop from defeated enemies.\
      \ <br><br>A tier based leveling system adds significant replay value to the\
      \ campaign missions. As players progress through each tier, new and greater\
      \ challenges and rewards await them: boss-fights, different enemy patrols and\
      \ tactics, additional mission objectives, and higher quality items.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">MULTIPLAYER</h2><br>Competitive multiplayer in Deadhold supports team\
      \ and free for all play, with up to 8 players in a variety of maps and gamemodes.\

    review: "Una pena que cancelaran el desarrollo, porque es lo m\xE1s parecido que\
      \ hab\xEDa a la saga Myth. Cuando lo jugu\xE9, en acceso anticipado, a\xFAn\
      \ estaba verde y ten\xEDa muchas cosas por pulir, pero ya era divertido y rezumaba\
      \ Myth por todos lados. Ahora nada, esperar que retomen el proyecto (dif\xED\
      cil), liberen el c\xF3digo o que Nordic Warriors, otro que recuerda a Myth,\
      \ incluya multijugador competitivo y cooperativo."
