But i could. Fun for a bit. Really fun if you just love winning simplton games. No real depth. Not hard to dominate at all. Confusing to start once over the curve you will win easily everytime. Wont play again unless it is updated or multiplayer. Worth 8$, ONLY if you like the sound of my review.","timestamp_created":1538633661,"timestamp_updated":1538633661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535714268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pM/tnuYCfqmDrAE="}
