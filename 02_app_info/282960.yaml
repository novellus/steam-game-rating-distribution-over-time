    review: "Atajrubah has a lot of promise but a ways yet to go.\n\nThe visuals are\
      \ rough but still quite pleasant to look at. There's a bit of distortion around\
      \ the edges of the models (notably trees) and the characters move in awkward\
      \ ways at times.\n\nThe inventory and crafting menus are...primitive and not\
      \ terribly helpful. There's an unexplained \"crotch\" slot that I'm wierdly\
      \ curious to see what eventually goes there. I'm guessing it's a belt but stranger\
      \ things have happened in games.\n\nThere are no crafting recipes as of yet\
      \ and while the basic process of playing the game is relatively familiar to\
      \ people who've played survival games, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot\
      \ to actually do yet. I do like survival games and the Arabian theme is new\
      \ in terms of the survival genre. \n\nThe game does snarl the video drivers\
      \ and crash rather regularly on my machine. This is not a point in its favor\
      \ but I'll withold outright hate because I don't know if this is a problem exclusive\
      \ to my rig or not.\n\nAtajrubah could be a really solid addition to the survival\
      \ genre if it follows through on full release with the promise it's showing\
      \ in the open beta and fixes some of the more glaring issues.\n\nA couple of\
      \ things that *must* be fixed before launch:\n\n- Day/night cycles are somewhat\
      \ erratic. Sometimes at night it's like someone just turned out the lights and\
      \ there's no indicated way to make fire or light of any kind. I did respawn\
      \ with a torch a couple of times but there was no indication of how to light\
      \ it so I just stumbled around in the dark. The shadows also move incredibly\
      \ fast as the sun moves across the sky, faster than your character can actually\
      \ run. This isn't major but it is definitely disorienting and visually odd.\n\
      \n- The game does not pause when you open the menu. This is a pretty serious\
      \ problem for obvious reasons.\n\n- Items do not stack and that's a pretty crippling\
      \ flaw when one arrow takes up one inventory slot. I'm willing to bet this will\
      \ be fixed later on but for now it's not a pleasant bug.\n\n- The crashing does\
      \ not add to the experience."
