Great to hop in for a few levels when you don't have anything else to do. You can really tell that the developers had fun making it and I certainly had fun playing it. \nIt's not very long, but it really doesn't have to be since the games replay value is high. \n\nThe game is a good description of society!","timestamp_created":1602845303,"timestamp_updated":1602845303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jczBmPUCeNCWqAI="}
