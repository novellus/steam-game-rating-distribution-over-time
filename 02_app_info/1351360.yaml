    short_description: In DevLife you start your career just before hitting 18. It's
      up to you to choose who you want to be - a graphic designer or maybe a programmer?
      Will it be a Website design or Mobile Applications? It is up to you to decide!
      And what if you chose wrong? Well... You will have to live with that!

    review: Well it is another Game Dev tycoon type game. It is in 3D!!!! Where you
      as a main character are mortal so you have from age 18 to old age to make millions
      or just some scrap, After death you can play onward (what happens after is not
      yet implemented). You can specialize in 4 branches web developer, mobile apps,
      game dev and app dev (not yet implemented). When creating own projects you can
      mix and match those categories. But own projects are for later stages of the
      game as it depends on amount of fans you or your company (separate count) has.
      You can also buy furniture and decoration stuff to place it in your office.
      To summarize the game has potential, can't wait what the future updates will
      bring.
