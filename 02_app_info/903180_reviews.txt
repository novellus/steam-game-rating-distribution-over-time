Its clearly a side project for the devs, so development is very slow. But it's addictive as hell. Its basically a real-time with pause roguelite dungeon crawler with a pirate theme. So if you like Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's Gate combat, you'll love this game. \n\nGo out on adventures across the high seas, kill monsters, get loot! Rinse and repeat. There's a town with where you sail from and get quests. There's also a decent amount of choice and consequence in the quests with a reputation system that unlocks different options. Different classes also unlock dialog options. \n\nThe game has a number of different game modes with different victory conditions, so replay value is high.\n\nAll in all I'm very surprised that this has gone under the radar, perfect game for bite size dungeon crawling. I only found out about it through the Steam Talk Like Pirate Day Sale.","timestamp_created":1600626542,"timestamp_updated":1600626542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw29ix1vQCePCEowI="}
