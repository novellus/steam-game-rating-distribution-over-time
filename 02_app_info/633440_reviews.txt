Even at a $1.49, its just not a game you want to play.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Switching characters should pause the action\n2. Each character should be allowed to damage or control enemies\n3. Simplify your controls (X to double jump, or jump off of walls, huh?)\n4. Each character's controls should have congruence to each other, A is always jump, X is always an attack or action.\n5. Each character should feel as powerful or useful as the next. Currently, only two of your four characters are useful. \n6. Communicate more clearly about the capabilities and limitations of your characters if you plan on forcing experimentation and a full restart to the beginning of each level OR respawn from where you last died OR give health OR lives. I was unsure of which character to use in a number of situations (will this character cause damage, will this character make it across this gap?) until I died and was punished by being forced to replay from the beginning and lose all my coins.\n7. Fix that jump float. It is so hard to aim for enemy's heads or ledges/platforms. This coming from a video game player whose played and beaten multiple Megaman games.","timestamp_created":1604161142,"timestamp_updated":1604161291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r9jdv/UCf7+rqwI="}
