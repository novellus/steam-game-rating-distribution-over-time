Oh, and saving the game doesn't work because you can't load your save files, not that it matters too much since the game is only thirty minutes long.\n\nWhat exists, then? Well, there is an actual story, but it's not good, and of course there's no actual \"you choose what to do\" except that you can quit the game, you can only confront your brother and get a bad ending. Of course, given what I've said, the player got the bad ending as soon as they bought this game.\n\nDon't make the mistake I did - skip this one, even if you already own it.","timestamp_created":1575876060,"timestamp_updated":1575876376,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60122150182723999","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Kbj9O4Ceo+S4wE="}
