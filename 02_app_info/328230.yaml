    about_the_game: Here's the soundtrack -- hope you guys enjoy it! It contains about
      36 separate tracks (with a bonus piano theme not played in the game), although
      some of them are just short cues. I'd say the OST to A Bird Story is more meticulously
      fitted compared to To the Moon -- it has more carefully time-matched themes
      as opposed to ones that continuously loop.

    review: '[b]DLC verdict: Get it on sale[/b] OR [b]Get it in the bundle with the
      base game[/b]


      [b]Comment:[/b]

      Just like with To The Moon this game had a very likeable soundtrack. If you
      liked the vibe and feel of it, you get all these short to medium long songs,
      in this DLC. While the price is a bit high there is a base game + soundtrack
      bundle you can get. If you already have the game I recommend to wait for a sale
      before getting this.


      [b]P.S.:[/b] You can press Download Album in the Soundtracks section of the
      library filter and then find it in "..\Steam\steamapps\music\A Bird Story -
      Original Soundtrack". Or in the game directory if it downloaded with your game.
