I spent more time downloading this (90+% of the 10 GB?! game is not even used and appear to be stock/stolen assets from elsewhere) than I did actually playing it.\n\nThere is barely any shooting present in this game as you can simply walk past enemies, with the melee ones being dumb as dirt and having the hardest time even following you. And then it just abruptly ends a few minutes into it. The game itself doesn't even know what it's about (the About button shows a blank screen).\n\nThis game isn't worth 5 cents. The title is all you need to know about it. Stay far away.","timestamp_created":1596778204,"timestamp_updated":1596778278,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553279697895050049","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx93Z4/MCefrymQI="}
