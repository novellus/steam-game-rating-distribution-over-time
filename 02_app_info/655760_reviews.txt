The levels are varied and atmospheric, music is good, but few tracks. \n\nMy personal gripes with the game is that the running is slow to start. You are airborne for a ungodly amount of time. Jumping always kills your combo, so it's useless 90% of the time. I have no idea when jumping would be a smart move to make save for the few need jumps to beat few levels. The controls feel off as you turn and run to get a high score. To top it off getting the achievement \"Kill a hillbilly\" is unobtainable due to a glitch. \n\nGame could be more entertaining for a longer time with more mechanics, tighter controls, and more levels. I had fun with it. If you like the aesthetic you'll love the game! Good experience for the few hours it takes to beat (or complete) it.","timestamp_created":1597458485,"timestamp_updated":1597458485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48MH89/MCeLDDmwI="}
