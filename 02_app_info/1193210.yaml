    about_the_game: Hunt the Muglump is a retro-inspired dungeon crawling adventure
      where you must brave the dangers of a dark dungeon in order to slay the Muglump
      by shooting it with an arrow.  The Muglump is a horrific, greedy beast that
      can and will consume anything and anyone it can get its hands on.  Along the
      way watch out for bottomless pit traps and giant bats that can carry you to
      other parts of the dungeon that may lead to certain doom.  To play the game,
      players must explore the dungeon.  When they enter a room, they will receive
      on screen messages indicating if danger is close.  Using these clues, they must
      determine if one of the nearby rooms contains a muglump and fire an arrow into
      it, slaying the beast.  After slaying all muglumps in the dungeon, players should
      return to the entrance to successfully complete the game.<br><br>Features include:<br>  <ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> Randomized map generation on each playthrough.  Never visit
      the same dungeon twice!<br></li><li>  A fully functional in game minimap to
      help players find their way<br></li><li> An original, retro-inspired soundtrack<br></li><li>
      Take the challenge to the next level by enabling Survival mode where players
      begin the game with zero arrows and must explore the dungeon to scavenge them!<br></li><li>
      No microtransactions, no free to play, ever.  Pay one price, get one game.<br></li><li>
      Turn the dials on the dungeon generation algorithm to create your own custom
      dungeon in Custom Mode, unlockable after earning the Dungeon Crawler badge.<br></li><li>
      Download the Hunt the Muglump soundtrack for free when you purchase Hunt the
      Muglump.  Includes two original retro-style music tracks used in Hunt the Muglump.</li></ul>

    review: 'Man, such a fun little game!


      Classic graphics and music make for a awesome time!

      I''ve only logged about an hour so far but will definitely be logging more.
      The simplicity of the game I think is why it''s so fun, but I didn''t say it
      was easy. Takes patience to make your way through the dungeon and make it out
      alive! Well worth the $6. Also, who doesn''t love a good Wilhelm scream?!'
