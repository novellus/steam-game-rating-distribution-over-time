      "Mystery Case Files: The Black Veil" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object
      Puzzle Adventure game. The game was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published
      by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "The Black Veil" is the fifteenth episode of "Mystery Case Files." Previous
      episodes: "Huntsville;" "Prime Suspects;" "Ravenhearst;" "Madame Fate;" "Return
      to Ravenhearst;" "Dire Grove;" "13th Skull;" "Escape from Ravenhearst;" "Shadow
      Lake;" "Dire Grove, Sacred Grove;" "Key to Ravenhearst;" "Ravenhearst Unlocked"
      and "Broken Hour."


      There are three different developers for "Mystery Case Files." Eipix Entertainment
      is the current developer for "Mystery Case Files." Previous developers: Big
      Fish Games Studio and Elephant Games.


      Please be aware that not all of the "Mystery Case Files" games are available
      on Steam as of yet.


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu,


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Expert;
      Insane and Custom.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can
      be completed at certain locations. The interactive map is automatically given
      at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Shadow items and Traditional
      word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.
      Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game''s extra feature
      section.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section
      as well.


      There is a collectible in the game: Puzzle Pieces. They are scattered throughout
      the game for the player to find.


      There are beyond objects (morphing objects.) They can be found in the hidden
      object scenes only.


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it
      can be accessed only after the main story is completed.


      There are nineteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes;
      Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Trophy Room and Game''s
      Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the
      entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
