These came in the form of new Technophages that add modes like bossrush, speedrun optimized seeds and an “Iron Dog” hard mode. One phage also adds a completely new phase to the final boss fight. <br>A set of new items was added again, unlocked by flawlessly defeating bosses. Bosses also gained the ability to spawn as elite variants, changing their stats and\/or behavior. A couple new minor mechanics where added and some of the game's VFX\/SFX where improved.","about_the_game":"The Deck Crew Edition DLC is a way for people who want to further support the development of the game by voluntarily paying a couple more bucks.
