    review: "I'm asking for my $$ back right now. \n\nIs it truly that hard to just\
      \ allow a player to map controls how they see fit?\n\nOne you go to start the\
      \ game, a pop up box asks you to config your controls ( EVERY SINGLE TIME ).\
      \ You can play up to 4-players i thought...but not if you only have the options\
      \ of keyboard/joystick for 1st player, joystick for second...and only move right/jump\
      \ for player 3 and 4. Huh? Yes...it's as confusing as it sounds. \n\nWhy on\
      \ earth would you not just have a simple \" Right-Left \" option for each player's\
      \ movement, along with one or two button inputs per player for jumping? How\
      \ the heck can you mess this up? IN 2019?! \n\nYeah...i need my refund right\
      \ now."
