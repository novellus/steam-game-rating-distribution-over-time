This is not a traditional RPG, and to be honest, it’s not really a traditional anything, but that’s what makes it so intriguing”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/bagogames.com\/the-pale-city-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Bago Games<\/a><br><br>“Roughly seven years in the making, and nearly all made by one man, The Pale City brings a world and narrative inspired by works such as Planescape: Torment, Xenogears, and more...
