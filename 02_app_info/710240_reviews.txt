I became very interested in what the creator would do with the mechanics (mini world especially) and unfortunately I cannot recommend this game at this time. \n\nPros : (They ARE there!)\nThe concepts are sound, and the visuals impressive for an early stage of development. The creator has even updated the visuals to be more framerate friendly even with ragdoll physics. The levels feels lush and like they didn't just slap some geometry together.\n\nBut what it has in flair it lacks in substance.\nCons : \nMechanically right now this game is clunky, and not player friendly. Controls are locked unnecessarily when tools are present. Thinking outside the box isn't rewarded, and certain in-game interactions conflict with the theme the game is trying to promote. Let me present some examples.\n\nThe mini world offers players the opportunity to  move MUCH larger objects than themselves, and it creates some fun interactions with the world. One part lets you place a bridge across an otherwise unpassable river. One part lets you use a massive block as cover from a handful of archery goblins! However, my phrasing is deliberate when I say it \"Lets you\" do these things. What if you try something new? Lets use the bridge on a different part of the riverbank to get behind the goblins... Nope, it locks into place to create the only traversable walkway. What if you want to use that large block to SMASH the goblins instead of use it as cover? Nope... passes right through them. What if I want to teleport or quickly access mini world with my sword hand? NOPE gotta un-equip the sword first. No \"auto-sheath\" function, really? And you can only access many features from pedestal boxes with the necessary piece you need for the obstacle. For example, a \"boss\" stands between you and the end of the level, and you qickly find your sword is useless. Instead you are offered a fireball spell that needs to be pulled from the box for EACH use. Standing still means the boss doesn't even kill you however, so it's NOT very threatening. Just another exercise in tedium to finish EXACTLY what the game intends you to do.\n\n\nTLDR:\nThis game has GREAT potential, but someone with some game design background should work with the creator to flesh out the mechanics and breath some life into this already potential filled project.  As it stands however, I find it unplayable due to being bland and nit-picky about what you're allowed to do at any given moment.","timestamp_created":1513369300,"timestamp_updated":1513369300,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwt31reACeLadkgE="}
