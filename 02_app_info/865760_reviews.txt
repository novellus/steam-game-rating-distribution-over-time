Although if you are a person who is turned off by terrible graphics optimization, bottom of the barrel voice-acting, or having your ears destroyed by sounds in a main menu screen because the options can only be accessed once you are actually playing the game, then perhaps hold off until some fixes come through.\n\nThe good of this game actually does almost outweigh the bad for me, yes it has terrible optimization (at low graphics quality with medium view distance I achieved a fluctuating 30-40fps on an overclocked GTX 980 Ti), yes the voice acting sounds like they are using a text-to-speech app (which they might be given that it's fairly obvious English is not their first language), and yes both the graphics and sound options are only available when you are playing the game (I mean at least it has sound options, it's truly amazing how many indie games lack them or only feature the ability to turn them on or off), and yet despite all that, this game is oddly compelling, it controls fine, nothing special there but certainly serviceable, it's the environment and feeling that it nails.\n\nVery few games make me want to just walk around and explore and experience the environment, I'm one of those people who even in games constantly wants to be making progress towards some objective or goal, and yet the surreal and dreamlike environment they've created through their low-poly, simplistic, and stylistic geometry combined with the heavy Depth-of-Field (which I normally really dislike but certainly fits in this setting), and very fitting visual and particle effects, really evoke a unique sense of peace, unlike almost any other game I've played.  That certainly won't be the case for everyone I don't think, but, it's certainly captivated me, unfortunately, Depth-of-Field and sub-60fps in the vast majority of games including this one gives me pretty bad headaches so I will have to leave the land of dreams for others to explore.  Should performance improve and the game be polished a bit, I certainly would not mind coming back to this game and seeing what more there is to experience.","timestamp_created":1528918821,"timestamp_updated":1528918821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471206694841384888","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iLmq/eMCcrf0ogE="}
