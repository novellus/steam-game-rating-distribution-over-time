    review: 'I do not recommend at all.


      Issues:

      1) It''s made in unreal engine so expect a lot of random frame drops even when
      standing still. I have a 1050 TI and my card can handle a lot of games except
      for this one.

      2) You DONT HAVE ANY SETTINGS OPTIONS! WTF. I PRESS ESC AND THERE ARE ONLY RESUME
      GAME OPTION AND EXIT. NO OPTION OF SCALING, OR GRAPHICS OR EVEN SOUND.

      3) RANDOMLY GET STUCK IN BLACK SCREEN WHEN OPENING VENTS, WHICH FORCES YOU TO
      EXIT THE GAME. THERE ARE BETTER PUZZLE GAMES THAN THIS ONE.'
