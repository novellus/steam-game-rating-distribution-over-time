There's better games out there. This game does not respect your time or your money. This comes from a person that enjoys Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro. Go play those instead.","timestamp_created":1609819862,"timestamp_updated":1609819862,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv7av6PYCcrPMwAI="}
