The art is a mix of pixel-based assets and hand-drawn character portraits, but executed well. \n\nCons: The turn-based combat leaves much to be desired. Early in the game there is a sniping component, but it is completely absent for the rest of the experience. I'm saddened that it is not in the latter half of the game.\n\nThe verdict: I would recommend this game. The story, characters, and geopolitical intrigue are worth the time invested, and since the creators are working on additional chapters, there is a chance the sniping mechanics will rise again.","timestamp_created":1609615006,"timestamp_updated":1609615006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwk/uh4vYCdLPpvwI="}
