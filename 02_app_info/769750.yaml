    review: "If youre into winter weather like me youll probably enjoy this. \n\n\
      Having said that, the $9.99 asking price is way too high and its bizarre that\
      \ this costs more than the other expansions. Considering its called \"Ice and\
      \ Fire\" though, its  all ice/snow and no fire. If youre expecting volcanoes\
      \ and lava there's nothing of the sort here. Theres about 2 hours of content\
      \ here tops...that includes 7 events and 1 championship. Thats it. \n\nGrab\
      \ it on a deep sale.\n\n"
