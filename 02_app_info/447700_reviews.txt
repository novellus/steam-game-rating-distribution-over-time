But with where I come from in the world of fighters, it's quite a great change of pace.\n\nBefore this, I was more used to playing fighter games like Strife! and Black Magic 1 on Roblox, Magia Record and Epic Seven, and Blade Strangers and the Touhou Project fighters. So when I first saw this, I immediately thought, \"Wait, what? That's... a thing?\"\n\nAnd of course, at first, I was a skeptic. Had never really been interested in puzzle games before, so I was like, \"I don't think I'll ever buy this game, ever.\" At least until I suddenly got super interested and ultimately decided to get the game. Went through the base story mode in less than a day, but I definitely liked - no, I LOVED everything about it, from how it switches characters with every stage to the character art/voice acting and the end sequence.","timestamp_created":1609301858,"timestamp_updated":1609563702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr6De4PYCdqbVvgI="}
