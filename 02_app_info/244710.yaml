    short_description: Experience the wild as a mother badger sheltering her cubs
      from harm. On their journey they get stalked by a bird of prey, encounter perils
      of the night, river rapids crossings, big forest fires and the looming threat
      of death by starvation. Food is to be found, but is there enough for everyone?
