    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/zM_KoKFA3vs\n\nI'm not\
      \ doing a normal review. This game is dead. No reason to review it at the normal\
      \ price. No, what you want to know is what I wanted to know. Is this game worth\
      \ getting at the deep discount price of $2.49 USD or lower? The answer obviously\
      \ depends on you.\n\nFor me, it was worth it. The bots aren't half-bad, especially\
      \ on the hard difficulty. I had fun playing 4 v 4. There's Team Deatchmatch,\
      \ Domination, Deathmatch, and Gun Game. Gun game doesn't work without another\
      \ player online so good luck with that mode. Domination does work, but it's\
      \ a little buggy as the enemy team seems to always cap the flag on their end\
      \ of the map, even if there's nobody near the map. So you have to stay right\
      \ on it if you want it to stay capped. TDM is definitely the best mode for this\
      \ game.\n\nThe AI is not the best, but it does a decent job of killing you for\
      \ any mistakes you make. Sometimes they will just stand there and not notice\
      \ you are right behind them. However, they do a decent job of overwhelming you.\
      \ Spawns are pretty bad in this game. You can spawn with enemies right behind\
      \ you and you'll die within a second. However, it works both ways as enemies\
      \ can spawn right in front of you for easy kills. \n\nThe locomotion is absolutely\
      \ the worst thing about this game. It does have full locomotion and snap turning\
      \ so you'd think it wouldn't  be so bad. However, it uses the grip button in\
      \ the direction of your controller to snap turn in that direction. Eventually\
      \ you get used to it, but it's still not good. \n\nI really didn't notice any\
      \ major bugs / errors. I think the game frame rates drop the longer you play\
      \ the game and there are intermittent & sudden frame rate drops, but it otherwise\
      \ usually runs at 90 fps even on my 1060 GTX. The graphics are okay. The sounds\
      \ are okay. Game is the definition of mediocre. And while there is a nice variety\
      \ of maps & themes for those maps for this price range (11 maps total), they\
      \ are all square based in their layout, which is disconcerting. Some are smaller\
      \ than others though.\n\nSo should you spend $2.49 USD on this game? Well, maybe.\
      \ If you like playing solo and just want a casual match against bots then this\
      \ game may be for you. I had almost 2 hours of fun and although I will probably\
      \ never play this game again, I feel I got my money's worth already.\n\n[b]Sale\
      \ Price Rating 5/10.[/b]"
