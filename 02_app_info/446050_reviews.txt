I outgrew games like this a long time ago, but I must admit it made me laugh out loud a few times at how ridiculous it all is. The retro vibe is cool, too; it totally looks and feels like something Apogee Software might have made back in the nineties. If you're a kid, and you have friends you can play co-op with, you could have some fun with this.","timestamp_created":1606104646,"timestamp_updated":1606104646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl4DT+fUCd5+AsAI="}
