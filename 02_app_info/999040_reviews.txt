Ended up walking up and down the same dark hallway for half an hour looking for tiny objects on the floor.  Finally found four fuses and turned the lights on and then... nothing.  All the doors are still locked, no new clues were provided. I'd already examined every square inch of the hallway in the dark, I'm certainly not going to do it again with lights on.\n\nI'm a huge fan of games that require patience and don't hold a player's hand, and I've completed tons of other puzzle/escape rooms in VR.  This one simply isn't interesting or enjoyable.  Honestly not even worth the current asking price of $2.29.","timestamp_created":1610201347,"timestamp_updated":1610201347,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u9be8/YCd+rnwQI="}
