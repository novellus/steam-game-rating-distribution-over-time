    review: 'I thought it is impossible to create such puzzle game that will slowdown,
      but its creators proved that it is not) The game needs some optimisation (it
      was a surprise that game completely closes by single ESC keypressing) but it
      does have a potential.

      Anyway I like the game. And I will like it more if the creators optimise its
      work with memory. Such puzzle game shall not go slow.'
