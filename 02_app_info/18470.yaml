    review: "So, [b]Helldorado[/b]... You can call it [b]Desperados 2.5[/b] because,\
      \ well, that's what it is. Comes with a pretty funny story, though. See, at\
      \ some point [b]Spellbound Entertainment[/b] ended up being so obsessed with\
      \ making [b]Commandos[/b] clones that one of them ([b]Chicago 1930[/b]) failed\
      \ pretty hard. Why? Well, for many reasons, I guess. It didn't get enough press,\
      \ it was far from being the best game from [b]Spellbound[/b] (even though it\
      \ sure had a certain charm and came with a bunch of fresh ideas, it was still\
      \ the worst in my opinion), while there were already too many of such games\
      \ on market. As funny as it sounds nowadays (the entire sub-genre pretty much\
      \ died with [b]Spellbound[/b], until [b]Mimimi[/b] picked it up and gave it\
      \ a new life in their [b]Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Sh\u014Dgun[/b]), [b]Spellbound[/b]\
      \ alone used to produce a new game of that kind every bloody year, while there\
      \ were also [b]PYRO[/b], who started the entire thing and some other minor games.\
      \ Like [b]KOREA: Forgotten Conflict[/b]. It was like with all those games from\
      \ [b]Ubisoft[/b] nowadays. At some point people were like \u201C[i]Seriously?\
      \ Another one of those? Seriously?[/i]\u201D. It was also somewhat buggy, so...\
      \ yeah. It failed. And when it did, [b]Spellbound[/b] started to fire people.\n\
      \nUnfortunately, with a brand new team behind [b]Desperados 2[/b], they also\
      \ lost the only thing that used to make their games so cool. I mean, seriously.\
      \ The original [b]Desperados[/b] team? The guys knew what they were doin'. They\
      \ loved [b]Commandos[/b] and they wanted to improve it and explore the new horizons.\
      \ Like, personally, I really wanted [b]Vampire Hunter[/b] game to happen. All\
      \ that while [b]Desperados 2[/b] team just... blew it. They've ruined pretty\
      \ much everything that the original [b]Desperados[/b] did right, while the new\
      \ game turned out so cheap and ugly that it felt unfinished. So, naturally,\
      \ even though [b]Spellbound[/b] already worked on the expansion and almost finished\
      \ it, [b]ATARI[/b] said \u201CNope, we don't need any more of [i]that![/i] Thank\
      \ you very much.\u201D What did [b]Spellbound[/b] do? Well, they tried to save\
      \ the project. The best they can. They eventually found the publisher and released\
      \ the expansion as a stand-alone game called [b]Helldorado[/b]. Because why\
      \ the hell not.\n\nSo, that's pretty much the story here. It's called [b]Helldorado[/b],\
      \ but all in all, it's an expansion to [b]Desperados 2[/b]. Or [b]Desperados\
      \ 2.5[/b], call it any way you want. But enough about that. Already wasted quite\
      \ a lot of time on that, so... let's look at the game itself, shall we? Well,\
      \ we shall, but... the funniest thing is \u2013 there isn't much to talk about\
      \ here. I mean, what do you expect? The game started as a bloody expansion and,\
      \ well, it feels that way too. For both good and bad (mostly bad, though, mostly\
      \ bad...) it's still [b]Desperados 2[/b]. Can't say nothing's changed, though.\
      \ Quite the opposite. The character models were heavily improved and are now\
      \ highlighted in the way similar to the first game (which is a good thing since\
      \ it makes them easier to see and control), the goals are way better explained\
      \ now and even have marks on the ground to make things easier for you, while\
      \ the new \u201Ccombo\u201D system that allows you to give the same task for\
      \ all the characters who can perform it is pretty cool and useful. Just select\
      \ all the guys and send them to kick the heck out of the bandits. Then just\
      \ sit back and enjoy the brawl. Like I said, useful.\n\nAside from that, though,\
      \ what we have here is pretty much the same [b]Desperados 2[/b]... thing. The\
      \ story picks up right when [b]Desperados 2[/b] ended (yes, it begins with that\
      \ weird scene about the [b]Doc[/b]), but it's still cheesy as heck and absolutely\
      \ terribly written, while gameplay still feels cheap and rough. Heck, they even\
      \ forgot to put one of the important libraries on disc! Not really a problem\
      \ with the [b]Steam[/b] version (you may still need to install the legacy [b]PhysX[/b]\
      \ drivers, though), but I still remember the day when I tried to launch the\
      \ game from disc for the very first time. I mean, come on! How many games miss\
      \ the important libraries on physical media? Did you even test the bloody thing,\
      \ [b]Spellbound[/b]?\n\nSure, the game is totally playable in its current state,\
      \ but, like with the original [b]Desperados 2[/b], you'll hardly want to waste\
      \ your time on it. You like the genre and already finished everything else from\
      \ [b]PYRO[/b], [b]Spellbound[/b] and [b]Mimimi[/b]? Then, and only then, you\
      \ may consider wasting your time on this game. Otherwise, pick up anything else\
      \ (literally, anything, even [b]Chicago 1930[/b]) and it'll be [i]much[/i] better\
      \ than this. Dixi."
