    about_the_game: <u><strong>STORY</strong></u><br>Take the role of Wally. A mysterious
      kid out to recover items from his past with the hope of saving what's left of
      the future. Hopefully, you're fast enough to outrun your enemies and expose
      the truth. Or at least live long enough to see what happens.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1323540/extras/aerialknight_Neveryield.gif?t=1606315318"
      /><br><br><u><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></u><br>Aerial_Knight's Never Yield is
      a 3D side-scroller that plays much like a classic endless runner. The game has
      an interesting story that keeps players always in motion. Run, Jump, Slide or
      &quot;Dash&quot; for acrobatic variants leading to dope combinations and avoid
      the challenges that await. Aerial_Knight's Never Yield is being built for players
      who love to speedrun games while being an experience that casual players will
      enjoy as well.<br><br><u><strong>SOUNDTRACK</strong></u><br>This Soundtrack
      for Aerial_Knight's Never Yield is being done by &quot;Danime-Sama&quot; A Detroit
      artist with vocals from black artists from all over the world.  <br><br><img

      /><br><br><u><strong>NOTES</strong></u><br>The Game is currently in development
      by basically just myself with a lot of help from some of my amazing friends
      when I need it. This is a passion project of mine and I hope you all enjoy it
      when its out. I'm aiming for it to be done before the current release date.
