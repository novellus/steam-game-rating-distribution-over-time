    about_the_game: "Veilia is an exploration adventure game, which focuses on the\
      \ story of Veilia, a cursed girl who has been separated from her body. It is\
      \ now your job to help her in her search for her old body as well as the sorcerer\
      \ that took it from her. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVeilia is a melting pot of adventure\
      \ games. It features many varying locations, each with their own challenges\
      \ and methods of completion. Players will have to use logic, exploration, and\
      \ puzzle solving skills in order to help Veilia recover the pieces that will\
      \ restore her to her former self. The game is intended to challenge the hand-holding\
      \ approach, and forces players to fully explore their environments in order\
      \ to progress. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers who enjoy full independence and an\
      \ immersive atmosphere will likely find this game to be right up their alley.\
      \ It features many locations, a full soundtrack, attractive visuals, a unique\
