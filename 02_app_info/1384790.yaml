    about_the_game: "D100 Dungeon is a game in which you will steer an adventurer\
      \ through underground caves and dungeons, looking for lost treasures and completing\
      \ dangerous quests.  With each game your adventurer will gain wealth, recognition\
      \ and become stronger and increasingly skilled in their pursuits.   The Computer\
      \ Game has been carefully modeled after the pen and pencil version, which you\
      \ will need in order to know the rules (which are available separately).  The\
      \ game enforces all the rules and does all the bookkeeping for you.  It is not\
      \ intended to replace the book version, but to provide a different means to\
      \ enjoy D100 Dungeon.  it is possible to switch between the computer version\
      \ and the book version mid-game by using the Print and Edit features.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nYour journey begins when you create an adventurer and start performing\
      \ the dungeon training missions.  Once they have been successfully completed\
      \ your Adventurer will be ready to face some greater challenges and begin questing\
      \ in an endeavor to gain notoriety and wealth, rivaling that of royalty and\
      \ who knows, one day their greatest exploits might even become stories and songs\
      \ per;formed by bards in every tavern throughout the Kingdom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe Computer Game draws the maps and processes the adventure sheets, allowing\
      \ you to sit back, relax and enjoy the story being created. Plus you will have\
      \ professional looking maps to print out and keep for years to come."
