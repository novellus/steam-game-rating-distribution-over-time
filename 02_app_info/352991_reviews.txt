Here's some helpful tips for anyone who buys this Starter Pack:\n\n1. You can easily know if you successfully got the pack by going to the cash shop and checking your current blue crystal count. (If your transaction was successful, you should have 1,000 more crystals than what you started with.)\n\n2. The rest of your items are \"Claimed\" by clicking on a shiny envelope that hovers near the top-right of your screen. To my knowledge, this envelope appears roughly 1-5 minutes after logging into the game. There seems to be no way to manually force this envelope to appear. You just have to wait for it. Be patient! (NOTE: The items are NOT sent to your Mailbox in-game.)\n\n3. Once you've claimed the items from the envelope, they will be deposited into your MARKETPLACE bag, and NOT your INVENTORY bag. (The marketplace bag is a couple tabs over from the normal inventory bag.)\n\n4. Do NOT use your expansion items for inventory / stable / lair expansions until you have manually expanded as far as you want to go with gems. This is due to the fact that each line of inventory or dragon slot expansion has a fixed price, so you're better off using gems on the \"cheapo\" slots, and then use the vouchers for the \"expensive\" slots. Even the item tooltips in-game reiterate this. (NOTE: You can use the 1,000 gems included with this pack to do this).\n\n5. If you use the Dragon Egg for Lady Vox (or any cash shop dragon for that matter), and you do not have a summon slot immediately available, the dragon will be deposited on the SECOND TAB of your Dragon's Lair. You have to go to a lair manager, and manually click the second \"dot\" to move to the next page of the lair in order to access your dragon. (The game itself does a crappy job of explaining this. I had to open a support ticket because I thought I had \"lost my dragon\" and the GM explained that Lady Vox is automatically put on the second Lair tab, even if you have a free spot available in the first tab.)\n\n6. Don't select any item from your Marketplace bag until you are ready to actually USE it. The Marketplace bag is basically free storage, and there's no expiration on the items sitting there, so might as well utilize that space rather than cluttering your (very limited) inventory & and bank space.\n\n7. Read all item tooltips VERY CAREFULLY. (As in the case of the inventory expansion items, many frustrations can be avoided entirely if you heed the warnings / suggestions provided in these tooltips.)\n\n8. I'd recommend spending your crystals on QOL items (e.g. maxxing out your inventory space) before you spend them on consumable or vanity items. Make sure all of the interface perks / unlocks / expansions that you want are obtained before going on a shopping spree in the cash shop.\n\nIf you even remotely enjoy this game, I'd HIGHLY recommend getting this pack. Don't make the same mistakes that I (as well as several other reviewers) have seemed to make.\n\nAbove all, ENJOY!!!","timestamp_created":1527213651,"timestamp_updated":1527213765,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mJbCyuMCdbSLoQE="}
