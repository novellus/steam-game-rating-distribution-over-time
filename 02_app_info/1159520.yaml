    about_the_game: <strong>Twists of My Life&quot;</strong> - a visual novel where
      every decision you make can completely change the story. There's no &quot;game
      over&quot; if you pick the wrong answer, but every choice you make will lead
      you to different outcomes in the many intertwoven plotlines. There are many
      beautiful, sweet, and sexy girls waiting for you. They will either love you
      or hate you... It is up to you and your decisions. Everything's in your hands.<br><br>You
      are a law student at the University of N. You live a normal life; you study,
      meet different people, hang out with your friends, etc. In short, you do what
      most people of your age do. At a pivotal moment however you get yourself into
      trouble which force you to move, beginning a new chapter in your life and brings
      us to where the story begins. I worked hard on the personality of characters
      and the emotional aspect of the relationships between people in the game world.
      The sexual life of the main character hasn't been forgotten either however.
      All of the scenes are written in a vivid and descriptive manner, and are strengthened
      by good visuals. You will meet several different characters in the game, all
      with different personalities.<br><br><strong>Game features:</strong><br>- A

      notes: Our game focuses primarily on story, but please note that the sexual
        encounters between characters are graphic. There are very few violent scenes
        in the story, but some of them have dramatic outcomes, so if you are a squeamish
        person, we highly recommend that you do not play this game.
