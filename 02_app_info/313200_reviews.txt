It does start out slow but picks up to some grizzly moments, especially in Chapter 4!  You are in the 15th century(or something like that) during the Renasaunce period. You are Leonardo de Toledo, (of Toledo)  and mentor to a thick-headed but brave apprentice named \"Bruno\". You have been sumoned here to solve a murder(or several). with an Inquisitor on your tail as you try and solve these mishaps at the abbey.  You are an investigator, not part of the Spanish Inquistion but you are not in good standing with them!  The beginning starts out slow, but it picks up after Chapter One. lots of underground exploring in Chapter 3 and lots of drama in Chapter 4. nice beginning opening movie and nice closure at the end.  Do not pass this up! play this and then go for the Director's Cut too!","timestamp_created":1609208039,"timestamp_updated":1609208039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45cCR1vYCcvemvgI="}
