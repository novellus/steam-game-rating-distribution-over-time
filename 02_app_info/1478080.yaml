    about_the_game: Yomi Domini is an action-adventure game that tracks your tendencies
      while progressing through the level. The info gathered can be used against you
      or fight you on your own level depending on your <u>difficulty selection</u>.
      <br><br>Choose between 3 heroes. <strong>Reyna the Warrior Vanguard</strong>,
      <strong>Hiei the Shinobi Prodigy</strong>, or <strong>Jamal the Runic Boxing
      Champion</strong>. Each hero commands<strong> 64 loadouts</strong> to customize
      how you prefer to fight and will adapt to your playstyle accordingly.<br><br>Each
      hero travels deep into the crust of their planet, Teiresia, in the name of each
      of their warring factions. They seek what it would mean to serve, to honor,
      and to claim glory. Deep in the Sistine Divide, lies a miracle mineral, the
      Petrago. A place where many heroes on both sides meet their end outside of the
      Domini-Valkan conflict. Shambling back to life, these heroes join the teeming
      horde known only as the Slain. Where once Petrago promised an end to the bloody
      conflict, it now threatens the whole planet. No longer does Petrago fuel the
      war that ravages the face of Teiresia; the mineral's soul revival properties
      serve only as a purgatory of endless battle that serve no nation. <br><br>If
      there were a hero that would step forth to rise above the legends that are said
      to have fallen here. If there were a strength to cut into the earth. If there
      was a cunning to probe into the mystery.<br><br>One masters their own story.<br><br>How
      will your story be read, hero?
