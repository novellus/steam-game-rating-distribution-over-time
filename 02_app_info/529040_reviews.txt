It's completely unplayable, to move I have to push a button, the screen goes drunk blurry and you walk backward to move forward until you can't walk backward anymore. Then you turn it on again walk backwards, let go and go forward.. \n\neither I'm doing something wrong or I simply don't have enough space for this oversight of a locomotion system to work.\n\nI also think the game should have a fun mode that just lets you go into a room with no timer and no score and let you smash everything to your hearts content. Seems to be the point of the game in the first place.. \n\nYou can't break china irl because breaking stuff doesn't make sense irl or would bring trouble? Break everything in VR and laugh like a manic the whole time without any repercussions. This is why VR is awesome.","timestamp_created":1562080872,"timestamp_updated":1562080872,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5NDR2esCcKvrygE="}
