Anyways, thumbing it down until it is fixed\n\n\nFun and good looking 3D tower defense game. It is a bit grindy, but I don't mind it since there is a lot of stuff to play around with.\n\nPros:\n- Nice, colorful and charming gfx\n- Every map has 5 difficulties and good incentives to beat them all\n- Some maps have traditional lanes, while on others mobs can appear from unexpected places\n- Many heroes to unlock, controlling a hero feels a bit like playing an action-RPG\n- Tons of stationary towers to unlock\n- Heroes, towers and weapons can evolve and level up\n- Potions and magic spells can be purchased\n- You can farm money and materials\n- Perfect for when you have a little bit of spare time\n\nCons:\n- On a crowded map it can be too easy to lose control of the hero by accidently clicking on a stationary tower\n- Does not properly support special resolutions like 3440x1440\n- No cloud save\n- Not the best translation to english, but everything is still easy to understand\n\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1449053000,"timestamp_updated":1465936009,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613383173942565918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48oqmqNUCd7SRSg=="}
