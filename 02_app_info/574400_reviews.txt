I've been listening to this in-game, and out of the game -- tracks like Intergalactic, Witching Hour and Catnip never get old.\n\nWorth noting, only the base 6 tracks are included, the 2 added in during the Spellstorm Update aren't included. All the tracks are available as MP3 files -- if you're interested in getting the extra 2 tracks, and all of the tracks in other formats, you can get them for a few CAD at [url=https://bogdanrybak.bandcamp.com/music]Bogdan Rybak's Bandcamp[/url].","timestamp_created":1551612849,"timestamp_updated":1551612849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tqXVoekCf4iZvAE="}
