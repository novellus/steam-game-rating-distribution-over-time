    review: "from my experience so far\npros \n1- it's a 5 dollar game.\n2- unique\
      \ gameplay the game's idea is simply to attack independent colonies and forcing\
      \ them to join your side then attack the main enemy with your new army (that\
      \ is a mixture of your soldiers and colonies soldiers ).\n3- good variety of\
      \ units beside the main 3 races (Humans, Foresters and Darklings) there is more\
      \ five smaller race (the colonies that I mentioned previously (Shades, Nomads,\
      \ Dragons, Trolls, and Elves) each with its unique abilities.\n4- campaigns\
      \ and skirmish.\n5- remote play ( i haven't tried it yet) and multi-player over\
      \ LAN Virtual LAN services should work for online multiplayer as well.\ncons\n\
      1-no online multiplayer Support\n2- some of the music and the voice actors doesn't\
      \ fit the game( usually because they are too cartoonish)\n3- the game runs in\
      \ its native 1024x768 resolution."
