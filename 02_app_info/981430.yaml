      \ heroes - At the moment, players can choose from seven different heroes - each\
      \ with their own unique class, skills, and playstyle to form a party of three\

      \  formulate their favorite combos. <br></li><li>Train and equip heroes - Heroes\
      \ can be upgraded, trained and equipped with a large selection of weapons, armor\
