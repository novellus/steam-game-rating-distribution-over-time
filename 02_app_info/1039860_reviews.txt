Serviceable graphics and soundtrack.  Minimalist menus.  Rock-solid controls.  Clever enemy design.  Unforgiving difficulty.\n\nExactly the kind of shmup I look for to appreciate.  Great game, looking forward to whatever's next down the pipeline.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1562481843,"timestamp_updated":1562481843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541284441947937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1562794045,"developer_response":"We're glad you're enjoying the game, we love Shmups too, the difficulty becomes meditative at some point, that's what's most intoxicating about these games. We tried to make Lifeless Vanguard as fair as possible in this regard.\n\nThank you for taking the time to write this.\n\nZouhair from Vibrant Allegory"}],"cursor":"AoJ4s5vL5esCdenFzQE="}
