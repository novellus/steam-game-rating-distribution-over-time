Maybe have a popup window before the game starts so you can fill in with regular keyboard?\nThey do try to make some of the 'legalese' easier to digest with \"Essentially, this means...\"\nCompany sends you a login code to get started. Since it's in VR I have to memorize this code to enter it with the VR controls instead of CTRL C CTRL V.\nTrying to enter the login info with the wands causes an accident where I click submit before I am done entering.\nThis causes the login to fail and then I have to get another code.\nOnce you are in the game there is a \"yoga mat\" that you will be doing your workout on. \nYou can move it around to make sure you have enough space to do your exercises. \nCool feature. However, it doesn't appear that there is any menu music right now which is de-motivating.\nThe game lets you choose an exercise from the following options:\n\n\"Beginner intervals\", \"Starter Cardio\", \"Starter Core\", \"Upper Body & Core\", \"Full Body Circuits\", \n\"Legs and Glutes\", \"Stength/Cardio\", and \"Custom. I chose Beginner intervals since it's the first option.\n\n\nThe music suddenly kicks on with some funky disco beats. Game has you move to different areas of the map to get an idea of\nyour height and your stride I guess.\nSuddenly there's a bomb and a bunch of colored boxes and orbs in front of me and I have no idea what is going on.\nIt isn't until there is like 10 seconds left before I realize I'm supposed to pop the shape of my hands that are in front of me.\nA bit of a tutorial would have been welcome here.\nSquats and pushups seemed to be a little light on the effort. I barely broke 45 degrees with my elbows before the push-up and squats counted. Tracking may be a little off.\nGame sets me up to do bicycles and it's set up that it counts the exercise if you look at a certain circle in the air. Essentially, you could cheat by just looking at the square without doing the bicycle move. Maybe situps would be better by measuring where the headset is (ground level and then above knees slightly in front?). It's up to the user to not cheat the system and make sure they are doing the full bicycle move.\nLunges worked pretty well. \n\nAll in all, it looks like a promising project. I'll keep an eye on it. I was certainly breathing heavily after my first workout so it did what it set out to do, it's just not very entertaining as of yet.","timestamp_created":1609727182,"timestamp_updated":1609727182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwy/DN5fYCcJ6iwAI="}
