    review: "Foto Flash is an adventure puzzle game where you try to save a pin up\
      \ magazine.\n\nStory:\n\nYou play as photographer at a pin up magazine. The\
      \ company is on the brink of shutting down and the only way to save it is to\
      \ get some killer photos, so you head out into the city to get photos to save\
      \ the magazine.\n\nThe story is incredibly simplistic and nothing incredibly\
      \ special, but it does do it's job well. A lot of the moments are pretty funny,\
      \ even though some of the writing is pretty bad. You know what to expect from\
      \ these sort of games before you even buy them, but I was pleasantly surprised\
      \ to say the least.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe art style is actually really amazing\
      \ and honestly I was quite shocked by how good it is. As soon as you leave the\
      \ small building where you work, you're introduced into a bright, colorful and\
      \ lively world. It was actually really fun to go around and exploring, seeing\
      \ the sights. There's plenty to explore ranging from beaches, woods and living\
      \ areas, each area has distinct places so you know where you are at all times.\n\
      \nThe character portraits are also really decent and I really liked the drawn\
      \ art style. Overall I'm really impressed with the art design, there's plenty\
      \ of effort that went into it.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe music is also really cheerful\
      \ and catchy and mixed with the ambience of the ocean waves hitting the beach,\
      \ cars driving around and birds flying overhead it really provides for a relaxing\
      \ experience. Not to mention with the money you get from photos you can actually\
      \ buy more tracks to use if you get sick of the main ones and the other tracks\
      \ are also really good.\n\nThe only negative is that some of the mixing is mediocre,\
      \ sometimes the ocean waves could get louder than the music, it required some\
      \ tuning to be perfect, but other than that I really liked the audio.\n\nGameplay:\n\
      \nFoto Flash is an exploration puzzle game, your initial goal is to get 10 photos\
      \ from girls around the map and usually they need you to do something for them\
      \ before they join you for a photoshoot. A lot of them require you to bring\
      \ them something that is hidden somewhere in the map. A lot of the times you\
      \ actually have interact with people to actually solve puzzles to get the item\
      \ a certain girls need. \n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy, but actually kind of\
      \ fun to solve. For example one girl wants you to bring a certain mushroom and\
      \ there's a bunch of different ones scattered around the map and you have to\
      \ bring them to a scientist to tell you if you've gotten the correct one, which\
      \ was pretty cool. \n\nThere are a few negatives. One of the biggest one is\
      \ that map is decently sized and a lot of the times what a certain girl needs\
      \ is placed somewhere far away and it requires you to go quite a way to get\
      \ that item and then go all that way back. It could get tedious to some considering\
      \ some locations act like mazes. Another negative is the controls which are\
      \ slightly slippery, but this one is easy to get used to since a lot of the\
      \ areas are incredibly open making it easy to traverse. \n\nVerdict:\n\nFoto\
      \ Flash is a pleasant surprise, it was honestly quite fun to go through the\
      \ game and explore the city and solve the puzzles. It's pretty short, roughly\
      \ around 2 hours, but a really fun to play. Even with it's issues like slippery\
      \ controls and very minor bugs, it's actually a really decent game and something\
      \ I can recommend in the sea of sexy shovelware. \n\nFinal Rating:\n7.5/10\n\
      \nPros:\n+ Art style is really good\n+ A lot of the music is incredibly catchy\n\
      + Puzzles are fun to solve \n\nCons:\n- Slippery controls\n- Minor bugs\n\n\
