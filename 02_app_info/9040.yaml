    about_the_game: After defeating Shub-Niggurath, you arrive back at your home base
      on Earth, but it's not all blue skies and butterflies. Apparently, not all QUAKE
      forces have been subdued. Chaos ensues as you blast your way through the QUAKE
      minions and toward the infested gateway. Your only choice is to find the source
      of evil and shut it down. Without any hesitation, and with more guts than common
      sense, you leap into a portal of unknown destination.

    review: 'I really enjoyed this mission pack. If you enjoyed the original game,
      then surely you''d like this.

      It''s a lot more quicker into the action than the first and once your in you''re
      going man, like straight to your moms house where she''s definitely got cookies
      in the oven'
