    review: "An underrated game sadly. \nPlaying this game is like playing a cyberpunk,\
      \ spy movie. A 3-minute infiltration scene stretches out to become 50 minutes\
      \ of tactical espionage.\n  You and your team of agents teleport in, sneak past\
      \ security, steal from guards, hack into their mainframe via electronic warfare,\
      \ and complete the objective - without getting caught.\n\nSo, here's an example\
      \ of how a spy action sequence might roll out: \n\n  You finally arrived at\
      \  a terminal. As you grabbed the hard drive, the main objective of the mission,\
      \ you did not realised that a guard strolled into the room and started aiming\
      \ at you: \u201CStop right there! Intruder alert!\u201D Other guards became\
      \ alerted of your presence. No time to lose, you shot the guard who saw you\
      \ with your dart gun. You and your team have to bail out.\n \n  The next minute\
      \ is followed by a cat-and-mouse run between the enraged guards and your agents.\
      \ You and your agents used a variety of cliche gadgets, such as tasers, holograms,\
      \ door traps and guns mounted with silencers. \n\n  Just as you\u2019ve reached\
      \ your limits in running towards the exit, an agent gave you a shot of fast\
      \ acting steroids. It gave you enough energy to reach the exit just in time\
      \ before the guards are able to stop you.\n\n  Will you be able to reenact the\
      \ same scene in this game?\n\n  Not exactly. Because, every game is different.\
      \ No 2 maps are alike.The game gives you a map layout and different grunts (Guards\
      \ and drones) every time. \n  You\u2019re given the liberty to choose between\
      \ your actors and actresses(agents), your props (gadgets) and your matrix-style\
      \ command interface (incognita with hacking programs) to run the show.\n\n \
      \ \n  How do you run the show? Well, it\u2019s really up to you how you direct\
      \ them.\n\nYour agents might sneak in swiftly like the wind, complete the objective\
      \ and walk out without the guards even realising you were there. This is clearly\
      \ the most badass movie spy scene that film makers often overlooked.\n\nOr your\
      \ agents might sneak through by incapacitating everybody in their way. It's\
      \ cool to use gadgets, but ......\n\nOr maybe your agents will use lethal weapons\
      \ to kill those guards, take control of drones and turrets and counter attack\
      \ the guards in the most desperate, cliche, Rambo fashion before escaping?\n\
      \n  Of course, the first is the slickest, coolest and most badass while the\
      \ last option is probably when you've make a grave mistake and you\u2019re desperately\
      \ bashing your way through for survival.\n\n Relying on dodgy stealth consumes\
      \ little budget and looks way cooler.\n Gunnery action and creating a big fuss\
      \ means you're clumsy af and wasting money on an action flick rather than a\
      \ spy masterpiece. \n\nUltimately, all of your decision counts as a tactician.\
      \ Have fun!"
