    review: I highly recommend this soundtrack. you can download it and take it with
      you wherever you go. And relive those memories you made in wayward, in your
      daily life. The struggle for survival. the composer is Austin Dhillon. Never
      met him, but i appreciate the soundtrack a lot.
