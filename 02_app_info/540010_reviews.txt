It's a 3D pipe puzzle game in VR, and playing on the Vive is a beautiful and serene experience. Great music, fantastic visuals and perfect difficulty curve.\n\nIt's difficult to find games that recapture the awe and sense of wonder I first had when I started to play Vive games.\n\nThis succeeds.","timestamp_created":1503237420,"timestamp_updated":1503237420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvtb7/90CfKKQgwE="}
