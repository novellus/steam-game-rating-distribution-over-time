Definitely a good start for the developer and a promising future ahead.\n\nNow there are a few points that I think should be addressed albeit nit picking: \n\n- Firstly the food falling, its hard to tell the distance from the ground as the shadows are too subtle. A good performance and UX tip would be to just instance a circular plane on the ground with some semi transparency that follows the x and z axis of the item and depending on the distance adjust the size. This was implemented very well in the first 3-D Mario games as the player couldn't decipher the characters distance from the ground. This feature could work really well for this type of game and it gives the game a semi nostalgic style to it that works both aesthetically and practically.\n\n- The next is the use of the music. I love the idea of adding fun and upbeat music but using a specific genre, i.e tropical house, can cut off a part of the market, as I among a few others can't stand it. So something more casual game orientated rather than commercial sound would be more appropriate but that is a personal preference.\n\n- The next is sound mastering. The music and sound affects are near deafening on the lowest setting. Personally to have to lower the games volume in the master volume control in windows after already lowering it in the game to its lowest is very off putting for a game and needs to be adjusted in the engine.\n\n- The missions and game modes are fun and there are many to choose from however some repetition makes it feel like a copy and paste but with subtle changes. An idea is taking some scenes and shuffling items around with various obstacles that a bug would encounter like an empty shoe, wrapper, table leg, dog bowl etc, Another idea would be to use things other than a foot stomping like a fly swatter and bug spray that leaves an area toxic for lets say 5 seconds.\n\n- Finally UI. UI needs a bit of work as it feels very prototype like and the pickup icons are cool but the simple black and white just doesn't pop. Looking at maybe some complementary colors like green and yellow with a red outline can really make it vibrant. Also adding a kind of size alternation to make it catch the eye could really help draw the eye to it better and a satisfying sound could + celebratory visual cue like a poof or something could make it more addictive to collect them. This could even be implemented with a verbal/visual reward for a combo like \"NICE JOB\" often used in Nintendo games to release serotonin and make the player feel good for doing well.\n\nIn conclusion I enjoyed the game but there is still some work to be done. I look forward to future patches and games from this developer!","timestamp_created":1605438943,"timestamp_updated":1605438943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1605439667,"developer_response":"Thank you very much for Review and Extensive Feedback!\n\nI will take it all into consideration for future updates!"}],"cursor":"AoJ48cXn5fUCe7fBrgI="}
