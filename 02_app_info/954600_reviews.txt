Very fun and fits almost perfectly with the music. The only part I'm not a fan of is ironically the main highlight of the video trailer. The section is slightly off-beat, or at least feels like it, and drags on a bit too long for my liking. Other than that the map is perfect.","timestamp_created":1565204708,"timestamp_updated":1565204708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540572822093963623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqo/etuwCeZb2zwE="}
