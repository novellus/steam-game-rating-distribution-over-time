It is pretty unforgiving but sometimes I want a game I can jump into for 15 or 20 minutes when I have time. It's true you restart from the beginning each time but you do get better weapons and power ups the further you made it before you died so it's not a total loss. If you like a wild shoot 'em up game, with wacky weapons and maps then this might be for you. It is definitely a fun time!","timestamp_created":1599082593,"timestamp_updated":1599082593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rv+vqPQCfJi2nwI="}
