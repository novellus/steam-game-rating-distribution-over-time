      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the third Episode in the eventually-long-running Farnham\
      \ Fables series. Buying this will unlock the entire third Episode in the Episode\
      \ list on Tape 1 (Episode 2 is not required). It plays exactly the same as the\
      \ first two Episodes, only with new characters, new locations, new story, new\
      \ music, new everything! If you liked the first Episode, try out the second\
      \ one, and if you liked that one as well, get the third one! It has FAR more\
      \ content than the previous two if you look hard enough!"

    review: This third chapter let me down in a way i wasnt expecting, a climax to
      the first two masterpieces ended with absolutely zero animal sex of any kind
      and just a lot of being insecure to hug children on the playground.  6/10
