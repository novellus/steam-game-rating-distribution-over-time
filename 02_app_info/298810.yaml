    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONSORTIUM Original Orchestral Score by\
      \ Jeremy Soule</h2><br>Music.<br><br>The language of emotion and imagination.<br><br>It\
      \ is one of the cornerstones of storytelling, from the bards of old, to the\
      \ symphony orchestras behind major motion pictures of today. We recognize this,\
      \ and we recognize the role that music will play in interactive storytelling\
      \ as the medium grows from its current state of infancy.<br><br>In most games,\
      \ music is an afterthought. Something which is created and produced, often separately\
      \ from the game production. With such evocative titles as \u201CBattle music,\u201D\
      \ \u201CExploration music,\u201D etc., it is often placed into the game piecemeal\
      \ wherever it happens to &quot;sound good&quot;.<br><br>Jeremy Soule has always\
      \ approached his games with a keen eye, and a steady determination to advance\
      \ the role that music plays. His scores are spellbinding, embodying the spirit\
      \ of whatever work he is contributing to, and his standards are impeccable.<br><br>We\
      \ approached the score for CONSORTIUM in much the same way one would a film.\
      \ The non-linear and branching nature of the game means that players will experience\
      \ the story in their own way, from their perspective.  Jeremy\u2019s music will\
      \ always be there, complimenting what you\u2019re doing, playing with your emotions.\
      \ There are musical foreshadowing and powerful thematic moments that will help\
      \ you to interpret the events and unravel the mystery. This music has deep meaning\
      \ within the context of the narrative itself, in precisely the same way that\
      \ the dialogue contributes to the narrative.<br><br>TRACK LISTING:<br><br>01:\

    review: This game is a terrible and expensive waste of money, it specifically
      requires an Nvidia graphics setup but looks like it was made on a toaster, the
      gameplay is underwhelming to the point of being completely unnecessary and the
      story is so short that it's barely worth playing.
