Is this game just as cheap? Somewhat but that's a good thing.\n\nFor the price of 15 dollars you get a tactical strategy game set on a isometric map that is turn based.\nYou are managing a team of Ghost Hunters who use vacuum based weaponry and toaster traps to fight and capture spirits, slowly earning money to become better at your trade.\n\nYou can upgrade your weapons, characters, vehicle, and HQ. In a way it does remind me of the early GhostBuster game from the Commodore 64. In small casual doses it can be fun. Don't expect to binge nonstop on this because you'll eat through the game very quickly.\n\nHowever despite the small dose of fun you get, there are drawbacks.\nThe music is fairly small in selection and very repetitive, so expect to turn it down or off after the first 20 minutes of play.\nThe artwork, though not the greatest, does the job decently.\nThe map feels very small for play, but at the same time that small size allows you to zip around the city at a fair clip.\n\nSo if I have these problems, then what's the good of the game? Honestly it feels good because of how simple it is. This game's small maps and limited UI doesn't require too much thinking. Lay the trap down, zap the ghost, and don't spend so much time on the map either the location is destroyed or your hunter's sanity (the health meter) goes to 0 and they run away. Your characters don't die as far as I can tell so it can be a forgiving game.\n\nSo going back to the beginning of this review, GhostControl Inc sounds like a low budget GhostBusters without the royalties and it is, but it does what it says: Capture these spooky ghosts, earn money, and keep doing it. There's no big story, no grandiose plot, no DLC, no controversy, it is very much that trope of \"What's on the tin\". \n\nFor the financially minded, if $15 is to much to spend on a cheap but fun game, wait for sale then. Aside from that, I don't mind that I got this at full price. The amount of money I put into this game would equal DLC on a big budget game that would maybe provide a portion of fun or an outfit in a MMO. For that amount of cash, I get a fairly casual and fun knock off of a beloved title from my childhood.\n\nGet it, play it, forget it is in your library, then reinstall it again for a quick hit of fun. That's my recommendation.","timestamp_created":1603223117,"timestamp_updated":1603223117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zOvio/UCcNGOqQI="}
