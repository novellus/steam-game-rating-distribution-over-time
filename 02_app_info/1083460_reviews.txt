I've never been great at micro, but in Rencia you don't control the army directly. Instead you set way points for your army to rally to and join the battle yourself in a top down shooter view. It's incredible fun and something I've always wanted in an RTS.","timestamp_created":1586669688,"timestamp_updated":1586669952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwMO5tvECfLWPgAI="}
