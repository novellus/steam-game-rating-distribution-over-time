The virtual cockpit (VC) could have more usable switches. However, there are just as many usable switches as the standard Westland on FSX. I actually  think they did a great job making this helicopter's VC! The helicopter handles quite well (if you know how to handle it). I saw other reviewers asked about lowering the rear ramp... The controls are below. Please note that you must hold the Shift + E  then release that combo and then press the number if you want it to work. Essentially, don't push everything at the same time. \nLower the top portion of the ramp: Hold Shift + E and then release. Then press 3.\nLower the middle portion of the ramp: hold Shift + E and then release. Then press 2.\nLower the bottom portion of the ramp: LAND! Then, hold Shift + E then release. Then press 4.","timestamp_created":1590581932,"timestamp_updated":1590662786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvf24rfICds3MigI="}
