      \ class=\"bb_tag\">    Conquest of Space</h2><br>    Blast off for the conquest\
      \ of Mars, Venus, Saturn or any other planet or asteroid in the solar system.\
      \ Create your own space agency if one doesn't exist, develop your space programs,\
      \ build up a consortium of space agencies from various countries to increase\
      \ your chances of success, expand your research areas to acquire new technology\
      \ for space, build launch centers, train your astronauts, launch satellites\
      \ or observation probes, construct telescopes and bases in space, discover new\
      \ forms of extraterrestrial life and don't forget to watch competing space agencies\
      \ because only the first one there will go down in history.<br>    The game\

      >    Cybersecurity</h2><br>    Protect your people and vital infrastructures\

      \ watch out for leaks and head off scandals. As head of the party, invest in\
      \ cyberprotection to safeguard against outside intrusion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

      \ terrorists, launch a new investigation and in each case, decide on targeted\
      \ arrests. You'll have to have nerves of steel because you can be blamed either\
      \ for an attack where the perpetrator was known beforehand or if you arrest\
      \ an innocent person.<br>    The game includes a new scenario on this theme:\
      \ &quot;Terrorist Threat Imminent&quot;.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">    USA-North Korea\
      \ Gobla Conflict</h2><br>    After North Korea sends an unarmed intercontinental\
      \ missile to the coast of the United States, tensions grow between the US and\
      \ North Korean presidents. As the leader of the opposition party in the US,\
      \ legally remove the current president, then eliminate the North Korean threat\

    review: 'For me the Space Race alone made this a must have, it''s really a case
      now of me getting to bring my work home with me, and then getting to do all
      the things that in real life might be frowned upon by my clients (Specifically
      aiming for solar domination) :P


      The performance improvements too are noticeable. Well worth the cash all in
      all.'
