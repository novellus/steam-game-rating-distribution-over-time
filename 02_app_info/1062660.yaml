    review: it's an extremely good game, but there are some rage inducing features
      and i might be nitpicking but im going to give my honest opinion for people
      wanting to play the game. My biggest complaint is that the enemies spawn rate
      + speed make it hard to unalive them. The only redeeming quality of dying when
      you cant turn around and contest the literal horde of enemies is that when bloodthirst
      procs you get a free heart, and when you complete lvls you get a large amount
      of hearts as is. But there wouldn't be a need for all the hearts if you didn't
      die to things that are almost unavoidable unless you get lucky to get the right
      weapons that also go well together. the weapons are fair and balanced, however
      the enemies are op and will slaughter you instantly if you make a mistake making
      the game not worth it to play cause it just makes you mad and you feel a sense
      of inferiority when playing. overall its fixable redundancies (you wouldn't
      need the amount of hearts it gives you if the enemies were a little more balanced).
      but make me dislike the game, and i dont mean its boring i mean if they made
      the crazy pumpkin and the water ghost things slower and gave you less hearts
      with a slight heart modifier at the end its balance issues would be fixed.
