      /><br>Highly focused firepower in a single tight beam. <br>This ship is like
      a scalpel, it delivers a massive amount of damage, <br>but requires speed and
      accuracy for that damage to be put to good use.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_df.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>The most powerful ship in the hanger. It can deal more damage per second
      than any other ship. <br>However, this comes at a price as this ship is slow
      and heavy. Shoot first, move later!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_speed.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>Fast, small and nimble. Quick reactions and good flying skill will allow
      you to get out of difficult situations.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_sr.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>A very capable Auto-Aim ship with a good balance of firepower and manoeuvrability.<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_mos.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>The smallest most agile ship in the game. If you can keep it under control
      you'll be able to punish the bad guys with its 3 beams of fire.<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_jug.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>A large beast of a ship. Powerful engines make this ship fast, but its
      large mass makes it hard to change direction.  High powered, but slow bullets,
      make an interesting combination.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_col.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>An Auto-Aim ship the will hoover up all the pickups on screen. Large but
      reasonably agile, you should be able to clock up some big scores.<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_slick.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>An Auto-Aim ship with a wide field of fire. An all-rounder good in most
      situations.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/272680/extras/ShipDetailsSmall_db.jpg?t=1447360059"
      /><br>Hazards come from all directions, so this ship fires in all directions.
      If positioned well, you can safely get into the thick of the action and have
      no fear of incoming missiles.<br><br><strong>Join the unit today!</strong>
