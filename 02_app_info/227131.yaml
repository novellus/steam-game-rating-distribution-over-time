    review: '[b]DLC verdict: Don''t get it[/b] OR [b]Get it in the Season Pass[/b]
      OR [b]Get it in the Deluxe Edition[/b]


      [b]Comment:[/b]

      This is the SECOND part of Tyranny of King Washington. We continue the story
      and it''s cool and the abilities are fun to use. However there are even MORE
      glitches & bugs this time. The stupid constraints don''t help it either. You
      get the EAGLE special ability here and it is set in the Boston. Also buying
      this DLC separately is nonsense because it has an open ending and you have to
      buy the other 2 DLCs to make sense of the story. This DLC is part of both the
      Season Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3 so you could possibly get it through
      there.


      [b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you
      cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code
      (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the
      game.
