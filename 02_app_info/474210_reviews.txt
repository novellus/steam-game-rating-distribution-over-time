The pixel graphics are good. The boss at the end of the game could be a little bit harder, whether that be multiple stages or more enemies. Other than that, Butcher is very well made, and I highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1492247432,"timestamp_updated":1609798475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z+vd5/YCdf7qdg=="}
