    about_the_game: "DCS: Mi-8MTV2 Magnificent Eight is a highly realistic PC simulation\
      \ of the Mi-8MTV2, a combat transport and fire support helicopter and an upgraded\
      \ variant of one of the most widely produced helicopters in the world - the\
      \ Russian Mi-8 (NATO reporting name \u2018Hip\u2019). Having serving in over\
      \ 50 countries in a wide variety of models over the past 40 years, the Mi-8\
      \ is a revered veteran of countless military operations and civilian services\
      \ around the world. Developed by Eagle Dynamics, the team behind the hit title\
      \ DCS: UH-1H Huey, DCS Mi-8MTV2 continues to deliver exceptional realism and\
      \ immersive gameplay within the DCS World virtual battlefield.<br><br>The simulation\
      \ features accurate modeling of all primary aircraft systems, avionics, and\
      \ proper functionality of nearly all cockpit switches and controls. Flight and\
      \ other dynamics are modeled using real-time physics calculations and carefully\
      \ tuned using actual Mi-8MTV2 documentation and pilots deeply involved in development\
      \ and testing. The result is not only the most realistic Mi-8 reproduction on\
      \ the PC, but a comprehensive helicopter model that correctly presents complex\
      \ dynamic effects particular to helicopter flight, such as: autorotation, vortex\
      \ ring state (VRS), translational lift, hover in and out of ground effect, and\
      \ many others.<br><br>As part of the DCS World battlefield, you are placed in\
      \ the cockpit of the Mi-8MTV2 to fly combat transport and support missions as\
      \ the left pilot, right pilot or gunner. Equipped for close fire support, the\
      \ helicopter can be armed with unguided rockets, gun pods, and on-board machine\
      \ guns. In the transport role, a cargo of up to four tons can be carried internally\
      \ or three tons on an external sling system to deliver and retrieve supplies\
      \ in a wide variety of terrain and weather conditions. A series of single missions\
      \ and a handcrafted, immersive campaign plunge you into the heat of battle in\
      \ the DCS World battlefield of countless AI and a variety of player-controlled\
      \ fighter and attack aircraft, helicopters, and ground units. Get online to\
