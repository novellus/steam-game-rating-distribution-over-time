      \ a new village from the ground up and experience first-hand what it was like\
      \ to create a new settlement. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a newly appointed bailiff,\
      \ you must decide what buildings to erect and what people to bring in, and you\
      \ must also settle disputes between the villagers. Each building is unique and\
      \ comes with its own upgrades, material and labour requirements, so you will\
      \ face some difficult decisions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA bailiff's lot is not\
      \ an easy one, but he can still enjoy some fun after a hard day's work. Get\
      \ yourself one of the new horses available and take it for a ride, throw a few\
      \ dice against seasoned players in your new local tavern, match your skills\
      \ against variously skilled opponents in your combat arena or just rest at home\
      \ in your own comfortably furnished house."
