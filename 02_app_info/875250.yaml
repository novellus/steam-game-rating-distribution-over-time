      /><br><br>Life on Dragonia planet is difficult, but interesting. Dragons have
      their sacred traditions. Every young dragon must undergo an initiation rite.
      He needs to make a round-the-world trip and study all the four sectors of the
      planet: Sector of Spring, Sector of Summer, Sector of Autumn and Sector of Winter.
      Only the dragon who knows and understands his native planet can be considered
      an adult one.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/875250/extras/2.png?t=1594018338"
      /><br><br>Burt was born and raised on Dragonia. Since childhood little dragons
      remember the simple but wise idea: only those who really know their planet will
      be able to live in harmony with it and will not break the delicate balance of
      nature. Burt has dreamed of the round-the-world trip since he was small, and
      now the time has come.<br><br>Travel all the way among with Burt, feel like
      a young dragon! Explore all sectors of the planet, visit the lands of blossoming
      spring, warm summer, golden autumn and snowy winter.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/875250/extras/3.png?t=1594018338"

    review: "This is a very simple little game, but it never pretended to be anything\
      \ else.\nThis game is honest. This game would never lie to you.\nIt's therapeutic\
      \ to watch the dragon's slithering movements as it travels through a simple\
      \ but beautiful world.\nI'd definitely recommend this game if you want a quick\
      \ lil' game with a beautiful golden dragon. \n\nYou eat deers, dogs & bunnies\
      \ as you dodge trees & mountain sides at high speeds.\nFun!"
