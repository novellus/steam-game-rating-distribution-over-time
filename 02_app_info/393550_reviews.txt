I got all the gems into the eyes and a big pedestal is supposed to come out of the ground so you can punch in some numbers that you get. I only know this because I watched a walkthrough because I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I wasn't doing anything wrong. The pedestal never came up. I even replayed the level, still nothing. Waste of time. Maybe I should just download it on my phone and it'll probably work there since you can get it on Playstore. Blah. Good thing it was only 99 cents.","timestamp_created":1593186304,"timestamp_updated":1593186304,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1593257338,"developer_response":"Hello @djgirard03\nThank you for reporting this. This should not happen. \nAn update will come out soon to fix this issue. In the mean time this can be solved by adding both red gems to the dragon first and then after add the green gems to the panther. This should make the pedestal appear.\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n"}],"cursor":"AoJwgLjT+PICeIW1kAI="}
