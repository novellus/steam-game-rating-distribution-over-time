One block high makes it feel like youre not really making anythin beyond a game intended for small children.","timestamp_created":1562617696,"timestamp_updated":1562617696,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539822995662689209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8LnR6esCcs7xzQE="}
