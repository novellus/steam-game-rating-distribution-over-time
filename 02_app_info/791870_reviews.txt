I think the problem with it is that the snow was poorly animated. I think the snow falling is very vital for immersion in VR and I've seen it done better in so many other games. The sad part is that I liked everything else about this ride. But because it's snow themed, it's very important to get that detail correctly and it wasn't in this game. \n\nThe ride itself was enjoyeable. Lots of speed then slow downs. Not sure how long it was but it felt like roughly 4 minutes long. I liked the airplane 3d model flying above and then crashing, that was very neat. The wolf 3d model looked amazing as well. That wolf is used in some of the other coaster rides, but is the most appropriate in this ride. The vistas look really good.\n\nRate 6/10. If the snow had been done correctly, this probably would have been the best VR DLC out of the bunch.","timestamp_created":1537942249,"timestamp_updated":1537942336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589624226093292236","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoLagiuYCeey4qwE="}
