Not in the graphics, the game is absolutely beautiful. Not really in the grind department, either. The enhancement system is way overblown in the reviews. I had to grind once and it's because the game stupidly teaches you how to dismantle items before unlocking crafting, so I blew up the tutorial crafting weapon and had to grind to get it back. The weapon drop rates are absurdly low. I only lost to the timer once and it was specifically because of this. Everything after that incident was smooth sailing.\n\nThe mobile stuff is mostly in the combat and the boss fights. It honestly feels like a game that was meant to just be snoozed through with an auto button. You pop your cooldowns and then just normal attack until the come back, rinse and repeat. You have infinite dashes, the enemies have no AI and will happily stand around doing nothing or attack in the opposite direction.\nAnd all of the bosses (except for one) I've fought so far are just upscaled versions of normal enemies with a bit of a paint job.\nThey recently unlocked Act 2 and they're already recycling entire stages from Act 1. It's the kind of recycling you expect out of an asset flip.\n\nThe potential is there for this game to be great, but it's slated for full release next week and I don't see where they're going to add actual progression and more interesting combat. I certainly don't think they'll be adding in unique and interesting boss fights to the game in a week.\n\nI will gladly change this review if they pull through, I would love for this game to be good. But otherwise there are genuinely free to play side scrolling beat em ups with more to offer than this.","timestamp_created":1609854377,"timestamp_updated":1609854475,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4r7uz6fYCfvzZwAI="}
