    review: This game has very good potential. People who like management games would
      love this. The only problem is you can play for about 5-10 minutes then the
      game freezes. (this has happened to me 3 times now but i keep trying)  If you
      save and exit then come back your entire save is messed up and you have to restart.
      Like i said i would very much enjoy this game and would play it for hours. But
      in its current state it is UNPLAYABLE. Until the developers fix saving and crashing
      i would not buy this game.
