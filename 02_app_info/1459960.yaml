    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The gameplay of Glitchpunk\
      \ is a feast for all fans of high-octane action, explosive shootouts and cyberpunk\
      \ aesthetics. It is top-down action inspired by the classics of the genre, wrapped\
      \ in a futuristic neon cloak. There\u2019s plenty of guns, melee weapons and\
      \ vehicles for you to choose from and cause havoc with. Experience frantic action\
      \ and wild police chases while listening to futuristic beats on your stolen\
      \ car\u2019s radio.<br><br>Run, hack, steal, drive, shoot and blast your way\
      \ through the criminal underworld of the future. Make some friends, make even\
      \ more enemies. Kill or be killed, even if it means killing everything you love.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">World and Story</h2><br>But that\u2019s not all: Glitchpunk\u2019\
      s dystopian streets, back alleys and skyscrapers are also stage for themes like\
      \ transhumanism, xenophobia and religion as well as an all too human story about\
      \ relationship, self-discovery and betrayal. The sex and drug infused world\
      \ of the future raises many questions, only one thing seems certain: humanity\
      \ is a matter of perspective.<br><br>You are an android gifted with a special\
      \ trait called &quot;glitch&quot;: It enables you to go against your programming.\
      \ Set out to destabilize the tyrannical governments of the post-nuclear world,\
      \ it's up to you to craft your own agenda. Across four unique locations filled\
      \ tech-crazed gangs, drugged-up gangs and governed by ever-present megacorporations,\
      \ take up contracts, earn money and upgrade yourself.<br><br>Influence whether\
      \ or not a gang leader stays on top of the food chain, or let heads roll. There\
      \ might be something more for you to gain than just money: An ally, or a friend?\
