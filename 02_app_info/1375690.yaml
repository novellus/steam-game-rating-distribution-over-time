    review: 'Solid entry in the genre of MegaMan-like games. Level music is on spot
      in my opinion.


      It''s a little bit rough on (some) edges but overall I enjoyed the ride and
      was worth my time.

      It took me about 4 hours to finish the game (about half the secrets) - the last
      2 levels definitely had a spike in difficulty.


      The good thing is you can tune the difficulty by yourself to some degree. Just
      grind some levels/gold and get more health/secrets.


      Will try another round later with 100% completion.


      I only encountered one gamebreaking bug due to me being me and playing games
      like no one does (complete level restart was necessary - always save after a
      level!). Had a talk with Jay, the Dev, and he will fix it soon. You can talk
      pretty open with him.'
