From someone who plays a lot indie horrorgames, this one is not bad. It has a few jumpscares, it's really short and the puzzles are, except from 1 time, logic and don't take much. But it made me feel scared a couple times and even when the story is not the best, it's totally worth being played. I liked it, but I got it on sale, probably wouldn't buy it for the full price.","timestamp_created":1609693259,"timestamp_updated":1609693259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z7zM5PYCcZCQwAI="}
