    review: 'Just to be clear, I made a mistake when I first bought this game. I glanced
      at it a bit, noticed "Double Fine", and thought from the looks of it that it
      would be something in the vein of [i]Costume Quest[/i], which I loved. But alas,
      I missed out that "Foam Sword" was the developer and it wasn''t the same group
      of people.


      So right away I realized that [i]Knights & Bikes[/i] wasn''t trying to be like
      that games, which is also fine. Although it was associated with why I bought
      the game during a sale, it didn''t mean I''d turn the game away.


      When it started off, I was interested in the style and thought the game was
      funny with the way the kids interacted, things like the goose (Captain Honkers),
      et cetera. So I thought, well, it''ll be interesting anyway.


      Alas, I lost that interest. The graphics and art style are great. The idea they''re
      going towards with the story makes sense. I don''t think I''m even halfway through
      the game but I''ve already figured out (possible endgame spoilers, assuming
      I''m right) [spoiler]that Nessa isn''t real, because nobody has seen or addressed
      her; and Demelza is going through a mental breakdown with this imaginary adventure[/spoiler].
      So I can see that story being fitting.


      But on the game-side, it''s nothing special. There''s too much wandering around
      empty areas, then you''ll end up at a set-piece where you need to walk, knock
      a few boxes or items, fight a few enemies, rinse and repeat. The combat doesn''t
      seem to gain any depth. Also, I got quite tired of some of the sound effects,
      in particular the running noises, but you can''t disable them without affecting
      other audio.


      I think a problem I''ve encountered with games in general is that I dislike
      them if they aim for breadth instead of depth, which is what I think happened
      here. The combat wasn''t really necessary and they could''ve just done a handful
      of battles in the whole game instead of doing a lot of lesser battles. Hunting
      for treasure chests, currency for bike upgrades, "open" areas with vague puzzle
      aspects in some places... Most of it wasn''t really necessary and it pulls me
      out of the game when there''s so many aspects that don''t add up to much.


      One of my favorite indie games in the past handful of years was [i]Celeste[/i]
      which focused solely on platforming as its gameplay mechanics, then built graphics
      and story on top of it.


      This game, however, seemed to throw a little bit of this, a little bit of that,
      perhaps for its developers to experiment but it was also detrimental to my experience.


      I think the maps could''ve been smaller and the game more straightforward, focusing
      more directly on its story. If that was the case, I''d have likely finished.
      But since it tried to act like a bigger game, it didn''t hold.'
