    review: 'As much as I sometimes wish I could offer a game like this a positive
      review given its positive intent and message, it''s pretty difficult to do so
      in the case of [i]Umbrella[/i]. Why? Because it''s really not a well written
      or properly translated game. English is obviously not the developers'' primary
      language, and yet the game was developed in English. This leads to plenty of
      mistranslated or awkwardly translated phrases and sentences that can have a
      very unintentional effect on the story throughout. Additionally, the story was
      simply not well written at all. All the emotional responses were more like a
      child trying to process adult emotions and various memories rather than the
      actual adult presented within doing so.


      While I appreciate the concept and the simple artistic style (and the rain is
      also a nice touch), the writing does not carry the concept well. Additionally,
      puzzles are just dropped in with no real context, and while they aren''t particularly
      difficult, they also don''t really make much sense at all.


      I do hope this developer either learns better English for his/her next effort
      (assuming it too will be published in English) or at the very least gets some
      better translation programs (or translators) and also works on actual story
      development from more than the most simplistic of places. Additionally, puzzles
      should make some sort of contextual sense and I''d like to also see some work
      on this. I''ll be following this developer''s future efforts, but I can''t recommend
      this particular one.


      [code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting
      my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.
