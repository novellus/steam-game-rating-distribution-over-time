    review: Well that was disappointing,Sadly the game itself looked somehow well
      made from that era however it doesn't mean the story had to suffer or be rather
      not engaging for I finished the 1st chapter and legit had no reason not feel
      to keep going on with the game at all,And the pacing of a story is is rather
      off,as in most horror games from before the 2000's they didn't spawn you in
      the game and tell you hey you see that tower go there,for all I knew this protagonist
      had no reason to go there,He just needed to go there,I would been nice if we
      got to know this protagonist for a bit and live in his shoes for damm 20 min
      at least and then the horror things happen to him,but it seems he was in the
      roof for no reason at all as when he sees the monsters for the first time he
      seems to be unaware of that they exist no to be ready for them at all thus making
      him be in the roof top as odd as it could be,I legit can not recommend this
      game to anyone who is a fan of the old horror games for this game just look
      like them but sure as hell played like one but the thing is they tried too hard
      on making the control feel like old games
