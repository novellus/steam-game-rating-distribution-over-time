If a game has good graphics, a story that is written to be exciting or entertaining, and great music, that’s all they need. [i]Exile’s End[/i] really attempts to push the boundaries of how far presentation can carry a game. Beauty of course, is in the eye of the beholder, but if you’re nostalgic for the era that [i]Exile’s End[/i] is trying to emulate, you’ll probably find the game to be quite beautiful. At the very least, the cut scenes are basically perfect in this regard. If you’re one of those people that appreciates presentation above all else, then you may enjoy what this game has to offer. For myself though, I’ve always been one to analyze the level design, then the gameplay, first. To me, even wrapped up in all of its graphical wonders, [i]Exile’s End[/I] commits the cardinal sin when it comes to rating a game; it’s boring. \n\n[i]Exile’s End’s[/i] biggest problem is that it doesn’t seem to know what it wants to present in terms of gameplay. It starts out interesting – to me at least. You’ve crash landed on a planet with all of your allies dead or missing, and you’re hanging on by a thread yourself. Your environmental suit is malfunctioning, so you can’t even fall very far without taking severe damage. It’s a great setup for a Metroidvania game, even if it’s a little frustrating. That genre can really cash in on the idea that you start out as a weakling and eventually become an all-powerful conquerer, and you certainly start out weak here. [i]Exile’s End[/i] seems like it’s trying to be atmospheric – certainly the claims that it’s actually a cinematic platformer rather than a Metroidvania testify to that. But its slower movement and pacing – albeit perfectly functional – sort of kills that atmosphere rather than build on it. This is especially true in the long run as monsters are encountered to the point where dispatching them becomes routine rather than a terror to be faced – thus it sort of fails at being a cinematic platformer. The game’s progression is wholly Metroidvania-like, but you never seem to move beyond backtracking through boring enemies so you can flip switches; you never end up being the powerful master of his environment.  The end result is a game that wants to be something else, ends up to be most like the thing that it claims not to be, but then sort of fails at being good at that anyway. \n\nWhile moving through the stages quickly becomes tedious, exploration does give some very meaningful rewards – so there are [i]some[/i] positives in the gameplay. Bosses aren’t particularly well-designed in terms of patterns and telegraphing, so upgrading your armor and weapons really takes the edge off of having to face them. Thus finding ammo upgrades still gives that wonderful sweet taste that you may have experienced in other exploration-based games. It’s just a shame that moving between them can be so uninteresting. \n\nAnother way exploration is rewarded is feeding you more information on the story. It’s fun to find communiques and tidbits that unfold the plot more organically, rather than [i]only[/i] having it fed to you through forced cinematics – even if said cinematics are also a highlight of the game. The game ends off on a ponderous note which I consider a major positive overall, but ultimately the narrative is still probably similar to something you’ve heard before if you’ve dabbled in any sci-fi prior to playing. There’s also a huge missed opportunity to tell that story through the environment itself. Some areas are better than others, but overall levels feel like they were made in service to the gameplay rather than to create a sense of “place” – which wouldn’t be such a bad thing if the gameplay was actually good. \n\nThere are some very talented people involved with [i]Exile’s End[/i], but in the end it falls apart due to poor direction. It never really sets itself apart in the ways that matter most and while it’s not [i]that[/i] bad, it exists in an environment where it can be safely ignored. I feel like any of the 2D [i]Metroid[/i] games capture what [i]Exile’s End[/i] does best, but better. While the more atmospheric Metroid-like version of Metroidvania is slimmer pickings than its campier Castlevania-inspired brethren, I don’t think that’s enough to recommend slogging through this one. \n\n2 out of 5","timestamp_created":1574691803,"timestamp_updated":1577823449,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628495872020721436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uXmru8Ce9rK3AE="}
