    detailed_description: '<h1>The End of Skyflower</h1><p>Hi everyone. It''s been
      three years since Skyflower''s release! I built this game as a freshman in high
      school -- and there were definitely many things that I could have done better.
      Number one on this list is continuity. Many improvements were never developed
      in time, and at this point, Skyflower has (regrettably) joined the long list
      of unfinished early access games.<br><br>For me, Skyflower was an incredible
      learning experience. It''s my first game that I''ve ever brought to release.
      As I start my next projects, I''ve got an idea where the roadbumps will be,
      and I''ve got plans to handle them. First things first: no Early Access! I''m
      only putting out finished games, and if you''ll stick with me, I hope you enjoy
      them!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Fight your way to the top in this

    review: 'Update 4: Another year went by, no updates. Just noticed this while reinstalling
      some games, pretty sure is doomed to remain ripware forever. DO NOT BUY.


      Update 3: Remembered this game from over a year ago for some reason, checked
      back, still no word from dev, absolutely avoid.


      Update 2: Still no updates and no word of whether this will be updated, would  recommend
      as a pass at this point.


      Update 1: Lack of updates makes this less of a must-buy, as the one obvious
      game-breaking bug is still not addressed. Still find it fun, but not playable
      beyond NG.


      [strike]Fun twin stick shooter that is entertaining, if yet incomplete. The
      controls are pretty tight, and the initial slow movement of the characters is
      offset by some of the items'' effects. I''d say "think of this as a stripped-down
      and still in early development Nuclear Throne," but they seem to fill different
      niches, at least to me.


      There are some ui and graphical issues, like the lightning effects not leaving
      the screen in some cases, or the player character and some static objects changing
      size (very minimally, perhaps because of how they are rendered?) when moving
      the cursor while standing still or moving slowly. The main menu and in-game
      pause menu need to be worked over (as the dev has said he plans to do in the
      next update).


      Overall, I feel it''s definitely worth the money (whether full price or on sale)
      to pick this up.[/strike]'
