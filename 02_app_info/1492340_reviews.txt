The Spaniards await the arrival of a strong squadron from the metropolis and weaken the Americans in every skirmish. The Americans must manage to realize their advantage in ships and wisely dispose of infantry reinforcements. It's fun.\n\nThe Queen of the Pacific, the USS Olympia has finally adorned the US Asiatic squadron. And it is opposed by the terrifying Spanish colossus - the battleship Carlos V. It's great!\n\nI recommend this expansion as the pinnacle of the Ironclads series.","timestamp_created":1609173744,"timestamp_updated":1609173744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmNeO1fYCediTvgI="}
