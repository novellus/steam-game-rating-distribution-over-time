You walk through endless corridors that all look the same with nothing happening for 10 minutes until you interact with a 'Monster' which can range from small inconvenience to instant death, making the game feel random and unfair at times. There are notes scattered through out the game that could build intrigue and give clues to secrets, but I have found they lead to nothing except another different looking room among the endless corridors. LOCIS has a good start, but not enough in the game to be considered finished. I applaud the developers for what they were able to make with little budget and two person work team, but I can't say I enjoyed the experience.\nEdit: After playing another hour, I realize the game play itself isn't captivating. Not only is the game simply a series of doors along a hallway randomly generated, the rooms in said hallway lack variation to keep it interesting. Different  areas are simply hallways with minor variations, making encountering new areas not even exciting more of a name change, the only areas with intrigue were either way to short (being a 5 second walk) or being a literal singular room. The only idea I found quite interesting was the Wayfarers. A group of beggars that you can give part of your soul to to gain a key, or you may leave them to their own devices and they die, letting you gain more soul. Other then that I find the experience boring and slow, to the point where playing is an actual chore. As I said before, This game needs more, there are notes that lead to nothing, doors that lead to nothing, characters that lead to nothing, and most of all game play that leads to a boring experience. \nEdit but Again: Finished the game, everything I said still stands, except the ending is very underwhelming.","timestamp_created":1608936162,"timestamp_updated":1609103906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528869330883026123","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzaKE0/YCePOYvQI="}
