    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">UPDATES SINCE RELEASE</h2><br>In addition to
      the original DLC described below, we continue to add new assets to our DLCs
      based on community feedback. Since the release of the PBR update to GameGuru,
      we have been upgrading assets with additional PBR textures. These updates have
      included:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Sandstone structures, concrete bunkers
      and rickety old sheds<br></li><li> Full break-down of two buildings to reconstruct
      any way you like</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Original GameGuru Buildings Pack</h2><br>This
      pack contains 50+ quality building assets all ready to be used in your GameGuru
      creations.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 4 Concrete Bunkers (all with internal
      spaces)<br></li><li> 4 Office Blocks<br></li><li> 5 Skyscrapers<br></li><li>

      We do plan to extend the range of buildings as we develop more for the pack.
      There are currently 17 buildings in the pack that are modelled both inside and
      outside. We're working on an update that will allow for more of the buildings
      to have internal areas and doors that open and close.<br><br>The pack will effortlessly

    review: Some great additions in the pack, i definitely recommend it. My only complaint
      is lack of buildings, especially houses that can be entered. This is probably
      my biggest obstacle in creating my current project. I notice in the description
      there is plans to add these to the pack in time. Is this still the case? It
      definitely would make a huge difference for the quality of game i am able to
      create.
