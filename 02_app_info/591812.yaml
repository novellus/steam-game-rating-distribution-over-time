    review: 'The chest and head piece, fit right in to that orky feeling.


      The silver shoota is only a shoota, despite the fact the skin is that of a big
      shoota. Very disappointing.


      If you want to support the game, but have your money funneled into Dead By Daylight
      or the GoT app, feel free to purchase this DLC.'
