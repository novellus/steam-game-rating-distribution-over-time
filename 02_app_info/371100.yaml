    about_the_game: <strong>Waste Walkers</strong><br><br><i>It is perhaps a decade
      into our future... Mankind's future. The economies of the world have imploded.
      Governments have waged war on both their neighbors and their own citizens. There
      has been a complete collapse of society, order, infrastructure, and morality.  Horrific
      weapons have scarred the earth and vaporized entire cities. Those who have not
      yet perished are forced to scavenge and struggle for survival. This is their
      new reality. Hordes of disfigured creatures hunt for food. Gangs of bandits
      rob, kill, and loot. You are but a dim flicker of light in a dark and dying
      world. This is the world of <strong>Waste Walkers</strong>.</i><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul
