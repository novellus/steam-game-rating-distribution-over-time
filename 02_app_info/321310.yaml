    review: "For those that don\u2019t know a company known as \u2018Killjoy\u2019\
      , a while ago now, submitted a very low substandard piece of work onto the Steam\
      \ store and sold it for around $5.00 known as \u2018Air Control\u2019. Eventually\
      \ as social media caught onto this fact, that not only was it a badly programmed\
      \ vagrant cash grab, but that the game itself contained many cases of copyright\
      \ infringement which the developer himself just stole without gaining approval.\
      \ Hence the company known as \u2018Killjoy\u2019 eventually became known as\
      \ a scam artist.\n\nThis tarnished reputation originally was evaded by the company\
      \ changing their name to \u2018Iron Game Studios\u2019 and again another quick\
      \ cash grab full of glitches and meaningless copyright infringement dribble\
      \ was released onto the Steam Store, but not all consumers are dumbbells and\
      \ soon many began to realise that this raw programming piece of sewage was from\
      \ the exact same scammers of \u2018Air Control\u2019.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V3JK_2GLBSk\n\
      \nEventually after a massive backlash exposing this fact, it\u2019s interesting\
      \ to note that the reputable publisher Kiss LTD ( http://www.kiss-ltd.co.uk/\
      \ ) took a noble measure of immediate action removing it not only swiftly from\
      \ the Steam store, but also from any other retailer, they made a formal apology\
      \ that this violation somehow got through their scrutiny process and offered\
      \ a refund for a period of time to anyone who bought this falsely marketed product.\
      \ Since then you can bet Kiss Ltd have tightened the reins to make sure this\
      \ kind of thing never happens again?\n\nHowever it\u2019s interesting to note\
      \ that even to this day many question if the developer ( http://zenfishgame.blogspot.com.au/\
      \ ) is really a scammer or more just a delusional programming wannabe. For one\
      \ thing, regardless of the sheer volume of glitches and bugs, one can\u2019\
      t ignore the amount of work that \u2018did\u2019 go into this press \u2018w\u2019\
      \ simulator. 30 levels of different landscapes, decorated with many animated\
      \ versions of fish. One quickly therefore asks were they the work of the developer?\
      \ Or are they also a copyright infringement? How much of this product was truly\
      \ his?\n\nWhat further makes this a puzzling thing is that the game starts off\
      \ with a begging statement requesting that you meditate and imagine what life\
      \ would be like as a fish. Whatever inspirational message the developer is trying\
      \ to get across soon becomes lost as you begin to laughingly experience levels\
      \ where a clown fish is experiencing flashbacks of her children being burnt\
      \ as she swims along, and a questionable level where your clownfish seems to\
      \ be on LSD.\n\nThe music which is supposed to be relaxing you into some type\
      \ of Zen trance, instead is piercing your eardrums with a heavenly choir that\
      \ sounds like they\u2019ve just sat on a hot poker. There is no in game volume\
      \ control other than to turn the damn thing off. Even the clown fish you control\
      \ eventually swims into an Angler fish and snuffs himself for which I assume\
      \ was an act of mercy in trying to get out of the game. Alas you\u2019re not\
      \ so lucky and for no apparent reason whatsoever get to control other fish in\
      \ the following levels again where the only objective is to press \u2018w\u2019\
      \ until you trigger the next cut scene. This isn\u2019t always the case though,\
      \ for instance one scene does not trigger any cuts, and instead you can swim\
      \ endlessly into the blue beyond for 6 hrs straight or more if you wish to experience\
      \ a migration scene across the whole Atlantic.\n\nWhat really gets my panties\
      \ in a knot, is that the developer of the game even spent time translating this\
      \ noble message of imagine what life would be like as a fish in more languages\
      \ than what is even currently translated on the United Nations Website. Seriously!\
      \ I KID YOU NOT! This guy REALLY wanted to get this message of \u2018Let\u2019\
      s have some fish empathy!!!\u2019 out there. I really wouldn\u2019t be surprised\
      \ if he hasn\u2019t started door knocking by now asking people, \u2018Have you\
      \ ever wondered what life would be like if you were a fish?\u2019 and let\u2019\
      s face it there\u2019s probably many out there with a Christian fish symbol\
      \ who might be tempted here\u2026\n\nIronically many who wanted it originally\
      \ completely scaled from the Steam store and now it is, a number of those avid\
      \ game collectors would now love to hook themselves a copy, all because of its\
      \ downstream antics and history. I concur and understand why some are truly\
      \ vexed about the game. Was he delusional? Was he a scammer? Was he both? My\
      \ personal beliefs is that he was definitely a very \u2018fishy\u2019 person.\n\
