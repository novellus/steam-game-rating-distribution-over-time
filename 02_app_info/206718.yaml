    about_the_game: One of each of vehicle type, but with a twist! Instead of helicopter
      take a pleasant ride in a hot air balloon, or  perhaps a tram that's been built
      like a boat to sail the city streets. These innovative vehicles will add a whole
      new level to the game and keep your company afloat with their high attractiveness.<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Hot air balloon</strong> - The balloon is an exciting
      way to get around the city. The sights are fabulous and the going is slow so
      the passengers have plenty of time to enjoy them. There are no complicated mechanical
      parts, so the balloon is reliable and doesn't need much maintenance<br></li><li><strong>Amphibus</strong>
      - The extraordinary Amphibus is a great invention. Looks like a bus, but glides

      - The Caterpillar is an unique vehicle. It's a powerful metro train, and looks

    review: Yes, these are good vehicles, optional, but a nice to have.  The baloon
      has a very high attractiveness.  I rarely use helipads, but when I do, I use
      these.  The bus (looks like a train), and tram (looks like a boat) also have
      very high attractiveness and are good to use when you don't have huge volume,
      and have an alluent community to serve.  I use them to go to outlaying areas
      that don't get overloaded.
