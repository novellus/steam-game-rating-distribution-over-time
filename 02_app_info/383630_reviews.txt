The graphics has no artstyle, sprites too small. Controls are not good, and in my opinion platformer genre games is obligated to have good controls and precise jumping mechanics. And OMG... if I could dislike a game only for a music... I mean if you want to hear cliche Egypt music that feels like it's played on backpipe you should buy this game. The main theme just obnoxious. And who is this \"seep\" boys? Is it just guys who program this abomination?","timestamp_created":1545156732,"timestamp_updated":1607121018,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502670586109161377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZP4l/YCfOfPtQE="}
