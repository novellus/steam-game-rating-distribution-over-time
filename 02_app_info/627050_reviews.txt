That way lies spoilers.\nGo watch the first season online or something.","timestamp_created":1498124477,"timestamp_updated":1498124477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pKzL59wCcc/AfA=="}
