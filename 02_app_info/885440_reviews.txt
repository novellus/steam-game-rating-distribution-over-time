It is already a great way to make music videos with very nice vizualizations. Hopefully the creators will keep supporting this and add more features. The dancers option is nice, maybe some more variations there. During the day I searched the internet for a tool like this. There are some available, but much more expensive and actually what I tested in those apps, was not of the same quality as Easy Audio Vizualization, and options were less then we get already now in Easy Audio Vizualisation. If you need nice looking music videos, I recommend you buy this product. Your YouTube music videos will look much better and probably get more attention. Same goes for Blog posts and so on.","timestamp_created":1608503932,"timestamp_updated":1608503932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxsaTwfYCc7vouwI="}
