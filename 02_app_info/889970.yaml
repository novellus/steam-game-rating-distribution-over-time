    review: 'plays like a bad partially functional grind clicker port

      way too many glitches to recommend and some aspects get not fun really fast.

      must reload to use new items, max 50 animals, need to muck every 10 minutes

      cannot disable needless annoying reminders, that grab screen focus whilst doing
      other tasks

      new foods endlessly replenish, so only need 5 to feed all

      warned of penalty for cleaning pigs, but nothing happens.'
