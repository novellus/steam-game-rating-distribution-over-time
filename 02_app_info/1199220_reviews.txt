The game's writing is excellent, and the protagonist's development over the course of the game is very well done. This is one of the few CYOA stories I've seen where the narrative itself is actually gripping. Moreover, the number and variety of endings is quite impressive. Contrary to some of the other reviews, I felt that the player has a lot of freedom in this game to do what they want to do. I will say this in part seems heavily dependent on the choices you make, and I could see how some endings (particularly the worse ones) feel more constrictive. \n\nThe author is also clearly very knowledgable about the ancient world and Greek mythology. The game is more than just a retelling of the Odyssey; it also brings in features from other Greek myths and Greek tragedy. For those player's who have a good knowledge of the Classical world, these intertexts are a really nice touch.\n\nThat said, the game isn't easy, and it will throw some curveballs at you at times. When playing the game, you need to be prepared to not succeed at everything. Some players might get frustrated by this, so it's good to be aware before going in.","timestamp_created":1609716767,"timestamp_updated":1609716767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kZOm5fYCd8ydwAI="}
