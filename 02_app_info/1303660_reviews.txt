I wasn't expecting a super interesting story but it's much more than an indie 2D game with a cute art style. I love a good story when I play games and in this one, it even had plot twists and cliffhangers. I loved it! It also goes really deep with themes like depression and philosophical questions.\nThe gameplay is also TIGHT, it's addicting and after finishing the campaign I went straight for the other game modes. The need of thinking twice before pulling the trigger it's the icing on the cake because it really makes you feel like a sniper. You need to be sure that the person on your aim is your target because if it's not then you will lose points for killing an innocent person. The game is about patience and agility, your targets are never standing still and you need to find them fast before something bad happens.\nI SUPER recommend it! Gorgeous and original art, fun gameplay, and great story!","timestamp_created":1610061883,"timestamp_updated":1610061883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.231492340564727783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ459TK7/YCdNezwQI="}
