    about_the_game: A demon gate opened in a village and let through many yokai, which
      included nuppeppo, yurei, and oni. The samurai master and his apprentice were
      the first line of defense, joined shortly by the onmyodo master and his apprentice.
      Soon word came to the ninja master and his apprentice, Yemon, and they rushed
      to help, but when they arrived both samurai had already been killed along with
      the onmyodo apprentice while the master had put up a force field barrier to
      slow the yokai entry into the village, but the barrier was taking damage and
      fell just then. The ninja master and Yemon dove into battle and both fought
      bravely to vanquish the remaining yokai, but the ninja master was also killed
      leaving Yemon in grief.<br><br>The onmyodo master rushed to Yemon and said,
      &quot;I will use my bunshin technique to create clones on the other side of
      the demon gate to stop the most vicious jikininki from spawning, and you will
      need to go through the gate and kill the other yokai as soon as they spawn while
      protecting my clones. You are our last hope.&quot;<br><br>Yemon stood and steeled
      himself; drew his katana and entered the gate.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul
