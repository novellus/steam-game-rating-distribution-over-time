Narratively and artstyle-wise it reminds me of Child of Light, with the rhymes and tale-like handdrawn style. Also Gris, from Nomada studio. \nFor that price it was a welcome and enjoyable experience.","timestamp_created":1584979784,"timestamp_updated":1584979784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlIaKhPECfPCx+gE="}
