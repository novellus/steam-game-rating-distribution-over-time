It really nailed the feeling of trying to tell a story on the fly with your friends. The game is short so the characters are fairly basic (the cute shy one, the goofy stoner, and the one who actually likes horror stories), but the humour is great and it's really funny to see them react to your choices, especially if you switch tones mid-track.","timestamp_created":1607930313,"timestamp_updated":1607930313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475476831197738647","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kq+HsPYCcv+GugI="}
