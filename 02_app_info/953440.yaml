      collaborative experience that\_asks people around the world to quickly describe\

      \ where they have a chance to interact with passing objects and unlock randomized\

      \ of\_collaboration, listening, and empathy\_that drives most of my other work.\
      \ At its core, I just want everyone to have the opportunity to learn from one\
      \ another in unexpected, creative, honest, and engaging ways. It pairs extraordinary\
