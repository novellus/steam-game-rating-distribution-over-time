      place on the imaginary continent of Eagarlnia where humans, elves, orcs, dwarves
      and the undead each share a corner of this land. As Eagarlnia takes up the Northern
      Hemisphere, the land is split into East and West by the &quot;Mountain of Gods&quot;,
      our story unfolds in the East where each ruler battle for power in the &quot;Land
      of Praise&quot;...<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1116880/extras/heros_gif.gif?t=1609938189"

      /><br><br><u><strong>Gameplay Synopsis</strong></u><br>By choosing to rule as
      the leader of a league, you grow your land and power through a series of decisions
      in internal management, foreign trade, battles, and other adventures. Make any
      of the two hundred heroes your war captive and win more land by training your
      military and strategy. <br><br>Unlock unique objects and weapons owned by other
      heroes through a completion of designated missions. Win by training your soldiers
      where you also need to unlock special soldiers with unique powers. <br><br><u><strong>Why
      we created this game the way it is</strong></u><br>We wanted to create an original
      IP for The Heroic Legends of Eagarlnia because we wanted an ending that was
      unpredictable. Compared to other grand strategy games that follow a predictable
      historical story, Eagarlnia is based on a brand new imaginary land where characters,
      powers, and capabilities are unknown. <br><br><u><strong>About the Developers</strong></u><br>We
      are an indie game studio that chose to embark on this genre with an original
      IP - something that we know very few teams would take on. Although we hit quite
      a few stumbling blocks along the development process, it did not stop us from
      trying to create a grand-strategy game experience for players that crave it.
      We strive to make the best version we could in our October early access release,
      please help us make it better by joining the discussion on our Discord group,
      Twitter, and Steam community! Leave us a comment here and we'll get back to
