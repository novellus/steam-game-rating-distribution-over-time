I haven't played it for very long, but what I have played is fun.\n\nFor the dev: the game doesn't look quite finished in terms of polishing -- the \"stories\" tab crashed on me and it honestly looks like you're still building it out. I hope there's an update to come with that. There are some spelling and spacing errors so running that through a spellcheck program would really help make this game feel smoother. There were also plenty of times I would run multiple cars through successful runs and avoid everyone, only to see them crash by the 5th car (when they had been doing just fine on car 3 or earlier).\n\nFor everyone else: It's honestly a fun challenge and the design and sountrack is really nice. There are other games that feel a little unfinished that I've asked for refunds for, but the core concept of the game works, the attention to detail on the cities looks fantastic, and the mechanic is actually fun. Pick it up when it's on sale -- something tells me this is a dev to support.","timestamp_created":1570308604,"timestamp_updated":1570308604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558037877082824707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhvjrzu0CdMLL0wE="}
