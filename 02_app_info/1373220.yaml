      /><br>Welcome to Port-Anthony. A small town that has recently begun to attract
      young people with its perspective. Choose your look and become one of those
      who start their new life in a new city.<br>Start with an apartment or live on
      the street, the game does not limit you in your choice. Explore your neighbourhood
      and find out where to buy furniture, food and clothing. Earn and spend money,
      allow yourself whatever you want. Keep an eye on your health. Don't freeze on
      cold nights. Drink water on hot days...<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1373220/extras/city.gif?t=1600272723"
      /><br>Explore the area without loading screens. You will have access to one
      of the districts of Port-Anthony, the number of which will increase with new
      updates. Also, regular updates will add new activities and facilities to the
      areas available at their time. The idea of the game is not to make the biggest
      world, but to make it as complex and comfortable as possible, so that the player
      feels comfortable and knows every corner of the city. In general - provide the
      world you really want to live in.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1373220/extras/Interaction.gif?t=1600272723"
