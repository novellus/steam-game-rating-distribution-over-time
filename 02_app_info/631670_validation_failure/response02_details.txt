Booper Get Home! is a 2D puzzle platformer in a 3D world in active development for VR, with art assets created by a 6 (now 7!) year old on the spectrum.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlot:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBooper is your typical kid with a twist: Booper doesn’t talk much. Booper likes to play and have fun; except while out at the park, Booper gets lost and needs to get back home. Help Booper solve puzzles, platform through an expansive, challenging world and explore colorful landscapes straight from a child’s imagination. As the game progresses, the known world subtly morphs into a wild and fantastical microcosm created wholly from the drawings and paintings of the developer’s son. Explore multiple levels of whimsy and fun while collecting the items you’ll need to help Booper get back home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nArt Style:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSince the developer is also a stay at home parent caring for 2 boys, the imagination of a child is a powerful lure for making a game. The landscape a kid navigates is filled with fantastical beings, heroes, wishes and the day to day stuff (including smelly socks!). The art style of a child screams to be animated and interacted with: it’s the end goal of any child’s creativity.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGameplay:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDisclaimer: Since this is a game geared toward younger players- a gamepad is highly recommended!

The player controls and guides Booper to search and find all the items needed to solve puzzles and progress to the end goal of finding home. Along the way, Booper will meet many wild and vivid characters, avoid traps, pitfalls and dangers, as well as make a friend or two!","about_the_game":"As a kid, speaking doesn’t come easily – especially when you’re lost and looking to find your way home.
