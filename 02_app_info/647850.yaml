    review: "Another lovely and creative game in the Royal Detective series.  This\
      \ is the second in the series (at least on Steam), and is the sequel to RD:\
      \ Lord of Statues, in terms of story.  In the first game, we had to save a town\
      \ whose statues had come to life; in this game, we are helping the girl from\
      \ the first game (Princess) to save her mother and learn more about her origins.\n\
      \nThis game isn't quite as good as the first game, despite an interesting premise.\
      \ Princess summons the Royal Detective help her rescue her newly discovered\
      \ mother, the powerful sorceress Selena.  The Detective finds themself exploring\
      \ a spooky forest and then the fabled, but long-dead, city of the elves. As\
      \ the game progresses, we learn more about Princess, Selena, and the mad, immortal\
      \ King of the Elves.  \n\nI didn't find the use of magic or statues as well\
      \ designed as in the first game; this game felt less immersive (less \"adventure\"\
      ) and more broken up into the usual HOPA tasks of finding the perfect tool or\
      \ odd-shaped key. At the same time, a couple of the puzzles were quite challenging,\
      \ and there was one that just frustrated me due to an obscure and poorly explained\
      \ mechanic (i.e., even with the instructions, I was a bit at a loss).  This\
      \ isn't deal-breaking by any means, but it's something to keep in mind.  Also,\
      \ like the first game, the HO scenes are tougher than many current games.\n\n\
      Pros:\n- interesting story, continuing protagonist and secondary character\n\
      - good number of HO scenes and puzzles\n- beautiful art, especially in fantasy/spooky\
      \ genre\n- appropriate music (though mine cut out once or twice, not so good)\n\
      - fully interactive map (except no collectible indicator)\n- choice of difficulty\
      \ level\n- excellent video /movie clips as before\n\nNeutral:  a little more\
      \ challenging than many of the newer games\n\nCons:\n- felt a bit linear at\
      \ times\n- interesting secondary characters but little feeling of interaction\n\
      - a couple of puzzles that were more irritating than challenging (I don't usually\
      \ mind challenging, so take that as you will)\n- instructions less clear than\
      \ in previous game\n\nI still recommend this game and this series!"
