The grammar is almost always wrong, words are mistranslated, and even the English voice actors seem barely literate (one of them cannot pronounce the word \"mineral\" correctly, what?). The translation is sometimes comically bad, but the comedy quickly wears off.\n\nSecondly, the game engine is a clunky and buggy mess. It's very hard to get things done in the game, and sometimes this even gets in the way of completing objectives.\n\nThat said, there is a hidden gem underneath. Despite being a fairly short game, its world is beautifully realized and there is a deep background story, which is worthy of a much grander game.\n\nBut let's not get too excited even about that one bright point! The potential is squandered by bad storytelling. For example: an entire sequence involves you trying to make your uncle a cup of coffee just the way he likes it. This \"quest\" has nothing to do with the adventure, the story, or anything else, and is a good example of how this story is narrated.","timestamp_created":1550435845,"timestamp_updated":1550435922,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhdbL/ugCfa6TuwE="}
