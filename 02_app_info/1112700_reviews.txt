Hey everyone\n\nBefore I begin the review, I wanna point out that I'm not paid in any way shape or form to write this. I'm simply a friend of a tester, and that doesn't mean I won't critizize here and there of what I actually think about this game.\nMy friend will also be helping me of what he thought of it when he was testing it out, so yeah.\n\nFirstly, the gameplay as it's probably what first comes to mind when you see this. The gameplay itself is silky smooth, with all the buttons being responsive as heck, and really makes you learn what mistake you made. Aside from that tho, the graphics seem a bit mediaocre for what it is, even if it's made mostly by one person. I know it's styled a bit that way, and it's made to look like that, but it just doesn't seem right to me, even for a Dream World. The controls get a little confusing as my friend (when he was still testing) told me that the developer changed some controls around, back when you had different control schemes. Interesting. \nHe said: \"Instead of putting both control schemes in the options, he just straight up removed the ability for you to change the controls for double tapping!\"\n Apparently you could double tap the right and left arrow keys to manipulate the gravity position, is what he's talking of. But idk, I think it's fine as it is.\n\nSecondly, the story. This game is definitely not made for story, which is okay, as long as it uses what it can. We follow a stickmin named Marvin, who was just done writing on his PC when suddenly the Dream Wizard breaks in from the sky and tells Marvin to go on some sort of scavenger-hunt to collect all the Knowledge Orbs. (which are knowledge-able, as you get them by manipulating) If he doesn't comply, the Dream Wizard will shut him to sleep forever and no happy ending will come from that. So he decides to get up and try to escape the Dream World, which is where your journey begins. I'm telling 'ya, this reminds me of Rayman and I like it. I'm not telling you the whole thing, as I want you to discover this! Right now Taz!\n\nAnd lastly, the hats. The hats are some kind of powerup Marvin is accustomed to wear after he finds out he needs these hats in order to manipulate gravity. You can get them in different styles, sizes and colors but they don't serve as an actual way of telling which one is better than the other and you most likely can't choose which ones to wear. (I checked options) My suggestion, if these really don't matter, I'd suggest letting everyone choose which hat to wear in the game.\n\nThat's all me and my friend could think of saying, thanks Josh for this awesome opportunity and thanks to my friend for helping me write this review. My friend truly wants to see this become a success, and I don't want anything more but for that to become a reality. So if you're wrapping your head around blankets wondering if you should buy this game, I'd say plz check it out, it's a lot of fun after all. Even better if you're playing this with family.\n\n~Pat","timestamp_created":1577807392,"timestamp_updated":1577807713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ruKqru8Cd+DX6AE="}
