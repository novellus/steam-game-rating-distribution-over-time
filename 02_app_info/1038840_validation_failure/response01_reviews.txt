I can say that Baldoo is a pretty decent change from the original Baldie formula. First and foremost there's only 1 hostile enemy (other than Baldie) which is the cartman that crashes into you and explodes. In this game you have stamina that is constantly depleting. When it reaches 0 then you die. So you have to eat snacks found around the school to recover your hp. Additionally Baldie is the only other one shot KO in the game, but he's substantially slower and walks rather than teleports like the original. All in all I'd say this game is easier in some ways and harder in other ways. \n\nIf you're interested in checking out a bit of it, here's my video.
