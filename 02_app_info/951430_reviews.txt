This I'm not a fan of... I mean everything looks great and kinda similar on paper... but then you play and its just obnoxious.\n\nFirst off... worst tutorial ever! Would not shut up... would not stop forcing me to make it's decision... got so pissed I stopped playing for like an hour and restarted. Second... there is like no ammunition to be found anywhere... it gets beyond annoying. Kill players that are shooting you, loot, no guns, no ammo. WTF? DA1 didn't have this problem... not nearly to the degree its in DA2. Yeah, yeah I get it... we can't get 300 assault rifles 1 hour in... but there is like complete zero correlation between what is shooting you and what you get for killing them. Especially when everyone with a gun seems to do more damage then you do with the same firearm... it gets really annoying.\n\nOther frustrations include, zero camera controls, cannot zoom or scroll the base, expanding crafting (which you think would be a good thing... until you realize now there is a billion ingredients too, many which are only useful for 1 thing... and in perpetual short supply.), story sucks, characters are lifeless, (seriously who the hell is going to write you a  freakin letter if they just robbed you and changed sides??)... the entire game feels like a bad effort of \"more is better, so we'll just do more of everything\"\n\nI mean I want to like the game so much... but its changed so much from the original its hard to recognize the two together. It doesn't feel finished, polished, or well thought out. Just more of everything... that will make everyone happy....\n\n","timestamp_created":1609876858,"timestamp_updated":1609876858,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwyeyI6vYCfuTmwAI="}
