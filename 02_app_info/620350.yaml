    short_description: Dark Hope is a puzzle adventure game set in a steampunk world

    review: 'This is a solid first-person adventure game where the highlight is the
      puzzles.


      The puzzles are relatively hard in that the clues to solve the puzzles require
      careful observation and note taking. For the most part, I thought the clues,
      whether presented in explicit notes, or from your own theories of how things
      work based on experimentation, were quite adequate. Sometimes the clues may
      be slightly incomplete (I believe by intention, unless I missed a clue) requiring
      a very small amount, like maybe 5 or 6 attempts of trial and error to get the
      final solution. Overall I was very satisfied by the puzzles in this game.


      The quality of the graphics, modelling, textures etc are merely adequate for
      this day and age,  but they get the job done. The game engine allows real-time
      first person movement (not slide show) but looks like it is a home-brew engine
      and it is barely serviceable. Movement and animations are clunky, there aren''t
      many options, no invert Y axis etc.


      This is not a pretty game. The main job of the graphics and engine in this case
      to is to present the puzzles which are well-integrated into the world. By that
      I don''t mean these are abstract stand-alone puzzles that you''ve seen before,
      but rather science or math based puzzles plausibly related to the game world.


      There is a story told through in-game notes and journals that are fun to read
      and add to the sci fi/ steampunk atmosphere. More importantly, the in-game texts
      often provide vital clues.


      I did run into one bug that prevented me from picking up an item.  I spent a
      frustrating two days combing through the game world for something else I thought
      I had missed that was blocking my progress. I eventually broke down and consulted
      a walk through which made it clear that I had run into a bug. I posted a question
      on the forum and within a day or two the dev confirmed it was a bug and within
      another day or so fixed it.


      If you like hard but fair logic/science/math based puzzles in a sci-fi atmosphere
      and don''t mind looking at dated graphics and using a rather clunky game engine,
      then is I strongly recommend this game.  I certainly enjoyed my time with it.'
