The building part of the game can be really frustrating, but if you are careful to keep your cursor at the correct spot, the pieces will show up and you can place them. The stairs have an annoying bug that won't let you put a floor panel where the top landing is, but you can put a ceiling panel and you can at least access that part of the floor.\nWatch out when you finally decide to build a ship. Just building the ship assembler will trigger multiple assaults, ground, drop ships and large air ships. You REALLY get pounded, so make sure you have the materials you need to complete the ship and arm it and supply ammo for all your weapons. I also experienced  Solar flares with the fire tornado's AND the large air ship attacks several times.  \nThis games end-game will pound you to a pulp! You can make use of the god mode built-in activated my the Test Mode checkbox on the main menu. It may be the only way to get to space. Even on easy difficulty, this game is brutal !","timestamp_created":1608760390,"timestamp_updated":1609197358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu+Ho1fYCd4rMvAI="}
