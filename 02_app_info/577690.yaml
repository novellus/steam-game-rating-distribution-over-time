    about_the_game: "Spooky and her mansion of creepy cuties are back in Spooky\u2019\
      s Jump Scare Mansion: HD Renovation! Can you survive 1000 rooms of adorable\
      \ terror? Or will you break once the cute facade dissolves, and you find yourself\
      \ running for your life from the unspeakable, hideous creatures that dwell and\
      \ write in the bowels of this house? They wait for you. They wait, and they\
      \ hunger for your encounter. . .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpooky\u2019s has been recreated\
      \ in the Unity engine, featuring HD graphics, 3D models, and some new twists\
      \ and turns along the way. Now with full controller support, Steam trading cards\
      \ and backgrounds, new specimens, the ability to toggle between the old and\
      \ new specimen visuals, and Oculus Rift and Vive support. This new version of\
      \ Spooky\u2019s will also have Endless Mode and all DLC bundled together. This\
      \ new game will also have a \u201CBuild Your Own Mansion\u201D feature integrating\
      \ with Steam Workshop. There will be both tools in the game to edit rooms and\
      \ a development SDK that allows players to create new specimen, mechanics, and\
      \ whatever they desire and share them on the Workshop!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWHY\
      \ THIS IS A NEW GAME:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you might know the original Spooky's\
      \ Jump Scare Mansion was written in GameMaker 8 - which only has the most rudimentary\
      \ of 3D support. In order to add features like 3D specimens, VR, Mac &amp; Linux\
      \ ports, and to fix a lot of the nagging issues (like getting stuck on corners)\
      \ and other much-requested features it has to be rewritten from the ground up!\
      \ We're taking this opportunity to add all that and more in Unity - which is\
      \ a modern fully featured natively 3D engine that is a lot easier to work with\
      \ for this kind of game than old GameMaker."

    short_description: Can you survive 1000 rooms of cute terror? Or will you break
      once the cuteness starts to fade off and you're running for your life from the
      unspeakable hideous beings that shake and writhe in bowels of this house? They
      wait for you, they wait and hunger for meeting you.
