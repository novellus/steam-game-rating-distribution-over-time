I want to review this product so that this game can get an actual average and other gamers can find this little fun romp. Gauge of Rage is a zombie horde game, incentivizing rapid zombie kills to fill your Gauge of Rage(makes sense). The items and ultra moves are all entertaining, and at times hilarious. If you want a fun distraction for a few hours, and enjoy top down horde shooting with light progression mechanics, you can't really go wrong with this game. And besides, it's 4$. you'll easily get that much fun out of it within five minutes. Get it, enjoy,  review, and spread the word!","timestamp_created":1558933489,"timestamp_updated":1558933489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41qjr++oCerWLwgE="}
