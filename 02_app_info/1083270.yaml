    developer_response: Thank you for your support! We watch your video. About the
      Boss you meet,first we are sorry not to tell players that can push bottom between
      X and B,just like"XBXBXBXBXB..."so you can shell yourself and attack your enemy
      (we wish that palyer can figure it out and be kind of game exprience) :)
