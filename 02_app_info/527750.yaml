      /></a><br>2048AD - the year in which humanity was faced with bio-terrorism.
      The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts
      of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells. Because
      of this, a special unit was formed by mercenaries who opposed human experimentation.
      One of the major terrorist groups created a secret base in the jungle and started
      the project &quot;Confluence&quot;, combining plant cells with human cells.
      The group of scientists that worked on this experimental process also raised
      an army of soulless bio-soldiers to guard the project. But during the final
      experiment, &quot;Confluence&quot; went out of control and began taking over
      its surroundings. You, as one of the best mercenaries, will have to stop the
      project in the only way possible: break into its epicenter and blast it to smithereens!<br><br><img

      /><br><br>The game takes its roots from classic first-person shooters, a series
      of games such as Wolfenstein 3D, Spear Of Destiny, Operation Bodycount, Blake
      Stone and many others. The color palette is taken from Operation Bodycount,
      while the game uses a unique graphical style, approximately similar to Wolfenstein
      3D. In Merger 3D, you''ll need to pass through long levels, breaking through

    review: "Eu diria que este jogo \xE9 mais similar ao [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/358190/Blake_Stone_Aliens_of_Gold/]Blake\
      \ Stone[/url] do que outros em si, por conta desse design futurista, onde Blake\
      \ Stone ocorre em 2140 e este jogo em 2048, s\xE3o quase 100 anos em avan\xE7\
      os tecnol\xF3gicos, em ambos os jogos, voc\xEA enfrenta criaturas geneticamente\
      \ modificadas relutantes de ambiciosos projetos cient\xEDficos que sa\xEDram\
      \ do controle.\n\nLogo, a ideia de [b]Merger 3D[/b] n\xE3o \xE9 original, mudando\
      \ basicamente o tipo de personagem e ambiente, um \xE9 no espa\xE7o e este no\
      \ cora\xE7\xE3o da floresta. O que mais me impressiona \xE9 que Blake Stone\
      \ \xE9 de 1993 e apresenta uma jogabilidade mais dura, afinal ele j\xE1 \xE9\
      \ bem datado e usando o mesmo motor que Wolfenstein 3D.\n\nAgora Merger 3D,\
      \ apresenta similaridades na jogabilidade travada, com ades\xE3o do mouse n\xE3\
      o responsivo que mais atrapalha do que ajuda, e n\xE3o podemos deixar este jogo\
      \ passar, pois ele \xE9 de 2016, 23 anos de evolu\xE7\xE3o no g\xEAnero e n\xE3\
      o apresenta sequer melhorias!\n\nE \xE9 isso que nos \xE9 apresentado, um jogo\
      \ que imita hist\xF3ria e jogabilidade de um jogo que se passa no futuro, apresentando\
      \ problemas que deveriam ficar em seu passado. Claro que temos alguns pontos\
      \ positivos, como uma larga paleta de cores e m\xFAsicas bem atrativas, mas\
      \ nada disso \xE9 suficiente para salvar este jogo.\n\n| [b]Valor pago:[/b]\
