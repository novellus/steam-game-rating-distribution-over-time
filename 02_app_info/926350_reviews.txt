Those old Japanese PC games got really weird and experimental with their limited hardware. Seeing this developer grab onto those older titles and kick them into this kind of weird 16-bit arcade mash-up is always great fun! Space Mouse is easily my favourite one, but this one is also quite good!","timestamp_created":1607751226,"timestamp_updated":1607751226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqZrcqvYCe6iuuQI="}
