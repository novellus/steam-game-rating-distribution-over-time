Think of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but centered around hacking and solving puzzles instead of defusing a bomb. But HEX has a leg up because, instead of having a manual for the user to flip through and take forever reading all of the different situations, the puzzles here are much simpler and easier to understand. Instead, what takes time is the execution of those puzzles, and the communication either between the two players or between you and yourself. I [b]LOVE[/b] that HEX comes with single-player functionality, which means I can play this game as much as I want on my own without [i]having[/i] to coordinate with a friend. It's much more fun working together in co-op, but the single-player option is very much appreciated in a game like this.\n\nIt's still Early Access, so there's more to see in the future. Already, a substantial update was released to improve the way you learn about nodes, from both the Hacker side and the Control side. The demo wasn't updated, so the demo features the old method of \"learn as you go\" and I got to see how poorly that played out. It's great to see the devs have taken players' feedback to heart already and made such a large update centered around the learning experience.\n\nThere's a few things I hope to see from HEX before it fully launches. I spy some uses for the money we're stealing in \"coming soon\" menus, and the devs promise more puzzle nodes, but my personal desires are for some achievements to work towards, some accessibility work like the difference between 0 and O, and some minor bug fixes here and there, mostly related to typos or voice line cutoff. I would also love an option to save custom games with a custom image and description, maybe even with Steam Workshop, but I do realize that's a bigger ask.\n\nReally, what's here is already a nearly-complete package, it just needs a little more time in the oven and it'll be a great addition to any co-op lover's library. If you're at all interested in hacking games like this, or if you really enjoyed Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, HEX is right up your alley.\n\nEdited to remove my mention of wanting Remote Play Together support because I realized that it still shares one screen, which wouldn't make sense for this game, my bad.","timestamp_created":1608705380,"timestamp_updated":1609052172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529042363166809082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw7vW+0fYCeNqvvAI="}
