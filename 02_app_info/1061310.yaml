    review: "I'm halfway through this campaign at the time of writing, but I feel\
      \ that I've experienced enough of it to give it the thumbs up.\nThe story and\
      \ voice acting are excellent and really pull you into the immersive story. That\
      \ being said though, one small gripe I have is that sometimes the event triggers\
      \ can be a bit wonky and the dialogue doesn't match what's going on around you.\
      \ However it's not a deal breaker and the missions don't suffer unduly for being\
      \ repeated, as they are really good.\nOne big piece of advice that I'd offer\
      \ is this:- learn to fly the A-10C properly before you attempt this campaign.\
      \ You will need a complete understanding of all the CDU functions, as you will\
      \ be given tasking in both lat-long, UTM and Bulls formats, and you will be\
      \ changing these on the fly. \nAlso, be fully up to snuff on the radios too,\
      \ as you will be given various radio freaks to switch and change to, and if\
      \ you don't know how to change radio channels on the fly then you will fail\
      \ to trigger the mission events. Also there's a couple of missions were flying\
      \ in formation and time on target is a factor, so practice those skills too,\
      \ but flying this campaign will improve you as an A-10 pilot anyway.\nWorth\
      \ the money I'd say\n"
