Snaliens has quite a mixture of different mechanics and explores how they work together, building circuitry-based contraption puzzles out of the various cables, switches, gates, and other such devices.\n\nIt's main gimmick, although it does not appear in every puzzle, is an object that the aliens can pick up which follows them like the body of a snake. This ends up having all sorts of great interplay with the other mechanics which creates some really fascinating puzzles. It's a little strange that the game didn't entirely focus on this idea, but the other puzzles without that mechanic were still very enjoyable in their own right. Perhaps the only strangeness is that the game is named after it. If you're looking for a pure puzzler with tons of clever puzzles and a lot of variety, this is it.","timestamp_created":1609084149,"timestamp_updated":1609084149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40PO40vYCcsflvQI="}
