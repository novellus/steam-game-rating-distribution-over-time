I could not relate to the protagonist at all; their motivations seemed to be already pre-determined regardless of my choices, characters were either boring, forgettable or both, and I kept losing track of who was who all the time.\n\nThe writing itself isn't bad; but that just has to be one of the worst ways to write about organized crime.","timestamp_created":1597544884,"timestamp_updated":1597544884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518828451633453369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8ozG+vMCf6XemwI="}
