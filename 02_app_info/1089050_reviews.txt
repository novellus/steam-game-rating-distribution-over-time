This game captures exactly that - the urban atmosphere of Goody's town with its' challenges, precise jumps and exploration. Big thanks to the dev! Recommended (especially for fans of 8088' CGA nostalgia).","timestamp_created":1603823902,"timestamp_updated":1603823902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw09PWtfUCcqe/qgI="}
