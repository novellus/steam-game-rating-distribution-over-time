      \ has called on your services, sending you on a journey into the unknown planes\
      \ of a mysterious peninsula in the hopes to expand the guild\u2019s influence\
      \ even further. You are meant to explore this place and gather as much information\
      \ as possible to reveal the secrets surrounding the area. It\u2019s a dangerous\
      \ task, but an equally respectable one. Do you have the courage to meet all\
      \ the requirements that define a Roadwarden?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to play?</h2>Roadwarden\
