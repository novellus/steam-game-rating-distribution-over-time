This is the perfect wargame for people who normally don't like wargames.”<br \/>\r\nPC Gamer<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“BATTLE BUGS is nothing if not an enjoyable game to play. The manual and graphic elements of the game are uniformly hilarious, from the radar display running on a ‘No Entiendo Lame Boy’ to gruff spiders whirling into battle in a Tasmanian-devil-like tornado. BATTLE BUGS manages to achieve that rare fusion, a meaningful tactical game which is funny as well as fun to play. No one will lose their job or spouse to an overdose of BATTLE BUGS playing, but plenty of gamers will have many enjoyable evenings of conquering cheese wedges and slaughtering spiders.”<br \/>\r\nComputer Gaming World<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“‘Battle Bugs’ delights with sounds and images. In the category of scenario games, it’s definitely first place. This game is an example of how you can have a great time with the subject, while bursting with humour and mocking our own reality to create an extremely easy to use and yet complex simulation!”<br \/>\r\nSecret Service<br \/>\r\n","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1462210\/header.jpg?t=1606121634","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> x86<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> x64<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Battle Bugs™ is used under official license from Code 10 Digital Ltd and Bridgestone Multimedia Group.
