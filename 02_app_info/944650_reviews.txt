The one thing I have to praise it for is the rather masterful world-building of the author. For such a short story - because it isn't overly long - the world-building was phenomenal. The options are there and they change surprisingly plenty depending on which path one decides to take, which is a fresh of breath air when paired together with the permission to be rather amoral if you had your mind to be.\n\nThere are some points where what the MC was thinking didn't quite align with the choices I had made, but nothing major. All in all, I liked the story for what it was, and what became a rather obvious rip-off of Frankenstein's monster's story quickly took a life of its own and had a much bigger story to tell.","timestamp_created":1606099845,"timestamp_updated":1606099845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+NfA+fUCdpz/rwI="}
