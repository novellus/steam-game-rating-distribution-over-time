    review: 'So I unlocked a code for the Thalos Principle (best game ever btw, truely
      must have!). but when i entered my code in the "REDEEM REWARDS" menu in the
      Thalos Principle it told me "The unlock code entered was already used by someone
      else. You need a new unlock code.". Now since I don''t know how to contact the
      deve i poste this here.

      Will change to positive once i have a working code. (i do have pictures of the
      code and the error).

      Edit:

      Nice and quick response, thanks! (sorry it took so long to change this review)'
