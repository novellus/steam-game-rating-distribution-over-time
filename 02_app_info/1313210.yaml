      \ /><br><br>Nimoyd is a science-fiction and fantasy survival sandbox adventure\
      \ set on Earth, in the year 2702, or any randomly generated planet you like.\
      \ A massive, open-world full of wonder, dungeons, and cities awaits you!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br><strong>Survive a Vast World</strong><br><br>Your only way to survive\
      \ is to dig, craft, and fight through this strange world. Manage your energy\
      \ supply as you explore forests, grass plains, deserts, dark caves and dungeons,\
      \ and generated cities filled with enemies. Beware the night though, as the\
      \ dark Spirits will haunt you.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1313210/extras/nimoyd_crafting-small.gif?t=1606932296\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong>Scavenge, Craft, Farm, and Survive</strong><br><br>After\
      \ crash landing with little to no help, the clock is ticking to find something\
      \ to eat and to develop the equipment you need for exploration. Each biome offers\
      \ useful resources for you to gather. Craft gear, lights, food, but also a bed,\
      \ a table, buildings, vehicles, or even a mecha. Whatever you make will help\
      \ you survive further away from your base. Who knows what else you can find\
      \ deep below in the Underworld, and who knows what you could craft with it!<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br><strong>Become a Hero</strong><br><br>Customize your hero based\
      \ on 16 hero types, ranging from humans to aliens, and magical creatures. Add\
      \ unique character traits such as \u201CBrave\u201D or \u201CLazy\u201D to make\
      \ them unique, and watch how other characters in the game react to you. Earn\

      \ alien colonists, or against the Underlord who lives deep below in the Underworld.\
      \ Use your home base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish your supplies\
      \ as you explore the vast world. Manage your defence against either the human\
      \ factions, the new alien colonists, or against the nightly Spirits \u2013 or\
      \ other players. Participate in wars between human factions or defend their\
      \ factions against those strange alien colonists from space, or even play as\
      \ an alien faction yourself.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1313210/extras/nimoyd_combat2-small.gif?t=1606932296\"\

      \ with lots and lots of player factions and cities. But since Nimoyd is as a\
      \ single player game at its core, take your time for that, and do it whenever\

      \ And what about the aliens? Why on Earth do alien colonists dig so vigorously\
