Something more casual, I guess? \n\nI am currently playing some farming games and they are really relaxing - Exactly what I need in my spare time. Next to that I tried the beardless wizard. I knew the game concept from the Ipad of my kids, so I know that it is actually not such a hard game. \n\nStill I am having a good time with the game. I enjoy helping the people and gather stuff and try to figure out in what order I need to collect the ressources to finish the level. I also like the variety in levels, it's not like \"oh here is a new level, just build everything again like in the last level\" every level has a unique twist to it - And even if you beat the level there is an alternative version. \n\nThe mechanics are really good imo, it kinda makes sense to me, you need to think \"should I upgrade the buildings or rather repair that bridge?\"\n\nOkay I mean I have only played for 1 hour yet but it was a lot of fun and I am looking forward to finish the game. I can imagine that some people can spend a long time with the game trying to optimise every level and get gold everywhere. MAYBE IT WILL BE ME? I mean I am not a completionist but I could imagine myself trying to get gold in the levels. And with my 36 years old I am slowly but steadily becoming a grandpa in terms of gaming. \n\nOkay whatever, the only gripe I have is that it has the same sound track in every level and even if its okay it gets annoying really fast. So what I recommend is turning the music off and listening to \"Trobar de Morte - The Silver Wheel (Full Album)\" instead (search on youtube). That music fits perfectly lol.\n\nGreat game in general, I am very happy with my purchase.","timestamp_created":1606879272,"timestamp_updated":1606879272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxPvdkPYCc+HUtgI="}
