And that's as far as that idea goes. The story almost goes somewhere a few different times but doesn't actually go anywhere. It's boring. And repetitive. Once you play the first level, you know the entire gameplay loop. It never gets more difficult or interesting. In fact, I would say it only gets less interesting as you play it. The physics are incredibly loose leading to failures when you haven't even touched anything. The \"story\", if you can call it that, is just random characters cryptically telling you that they have committed crimes against humanity or nature and you have to put the barrels in a hole now. Sometimes you can burn stuff. That's it. That's the whole game.\n\n I bought this for $2.59 and I felt ripped off. The fact that the dev wants $12.99 normally makes this an ab-so-lute DO NOT BUY.","timestamp_created":1584496515,"timestamp_updated":1584496515,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587750852108001709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+8LW9fACf4Pw+AE="}
