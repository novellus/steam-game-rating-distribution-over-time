Well, this is the game for you!\n\nDespite what the devs commented on this review, they truly didn't give a damn, I went to their discord server and I was blatantly ignored when I told them the issue and my specs, if I could, I'd refund this.","timestamp_created":1584554143,"timestamp_updated":1603294165,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1584584613,"developer_response":"Hi there - sorry to hear you are having trouble with basic aiming.
