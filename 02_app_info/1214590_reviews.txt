Most items are stuck at an uncomfortable angle.\n*No clue what I'm expected to do half the time.\n*The story, is just bad.\n\nThe good:\n*Half the puzzles are fun, though fairly repetitive.\n*I love being able to collect things.","timestamp_created":1586914880,"timestamp_updated":1586915413,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463483124971389771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wPHhvfECfujtgAI="}
