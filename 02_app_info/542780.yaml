    review: "INCREDIBLY ACCURATE\n \nThis game is a very acurate racing/drifting simulation,\
      \ similar to Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, but a lot better. The physics are\
      \ true-to-life and the graphics are incredible. The crashing animations are\
      \ very accurate, and so are the physics. For example, hitting a traffic cone\
      \ head on sends you flying 30 feet into the air, causing catastrophic damage\
      \ to the exhaust system and rear bumper, but leaving not even a scratch on the\
      \ front end.\n\nRecommend to everyone who like anything. Stop what you are doing\
      \ and download this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW Im called benisgayxd on the leaderboard"
