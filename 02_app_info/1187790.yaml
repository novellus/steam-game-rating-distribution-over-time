    review: "Picked this game up after trying the demo. For the most part, i'm very\
      \ impressed! I used to shoot trap (D.T.L, A.B.T) and English skeet for my county,\
      \ and have had trials for England, although I have not shot competition for\
      \ a number of years, mainly due to the cost. \n\nThis game feels very close\
      \ to real life clay shooting! I make similar mistakes that i make in real life,\
      \ miss when I expect to miss, and hit what i expect to hit. I like the online\
      \ leaderboards, and I am aiming to top them all. I feel a few tweaks are needed\
      \ though. American trap feels just a little to easy. After a little practice\
      \ shooting rounds of 25, i attempted shooting a round of 100, and hit 100 straight\
      \ on my first attempt. Though i have shot 100 straight in D.T.L before (similar\
      \ to american trap), I doubt i could do it with such ease now. I'd likely only\
      \ hit 90-95 IRL with my current ability. The Olympic skeet however, feels far\
      \ to hard. I'd usually average about 80-90/100, but the game only allows for\
      \ rounds of 25, of which i'm lucky to hit just 10. Stand 8 in particular feels\
      \ impossible to hit anything. I can't pinpoint what exactly is so hard about\
      \ the mode, but its clear i'm not the only one that finds it unrealistically\
      \ challenging, as the best ever score (according to the leaderboard) is a measly\
      \ 20/25. Maybe due in part to the resolution making the targets hard to see,\
      \ but otherwise i'm not sure what else is causing the low scores.\n\nI love\
      \ the gun customisation options, i use a Ceasar Guerini high rib trap gun IRL\
      \ and the gun i use in game shoots exactly the same. Although, to play the game\
      \ with any success, a VR gunstock is a necessity. I have been playing with a\
      \ cardboard stock i made myself, but have ordered a proper one to use in this\
      \ game and others. \n\nOverall, excellent game, would like to see more features\
      \ such as new disciplines, online competitions, and a practice mode where you\
      \ can practice shooting a specific target, for example high house from 3rd skeet\
      \ stand. I feel practice in game will translate well IRL, and i'm looking forward\
      \ to shooting again IRL to see if my scores have improved with the practice\
      \ i've gained in game. \n"
