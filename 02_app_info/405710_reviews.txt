These are great tracks already, but if there is any chance, it might help to add some extra tracks, since it becomes a bit repetative after several continuous in game hours.\n\nJust a bit of a suggestion: When building houses, they easily get very dark inside as windows and lights don't seem to have such a big effect on surrounding blocks as they could/should to be a bit more realistic.\nAnd I do get the variety of the crating and cooking tables and like the challenge, but I think some might be able to be cut away, since I find that e.g. assembly and combine pretty much works the same way.","timestamp_created":1609927823,"timestamp_updated":1609927823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46aHL6/YCd936wAI="}
