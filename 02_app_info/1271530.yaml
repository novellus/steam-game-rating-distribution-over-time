    about_the_game: A tongue-in-cheek 1980s revenge story! You play as the foul-mouthed
      superhero, Night Jackal, as he takes to the streets on a revenge-fueled rampage
      to mow down a crime syndicate responsible for murdering his wife.<h2 class="bb_tag">So,
      what does daddy get?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Both action <i>AND</i>
      racing!</strong> - Race to reach checkpoints before time runs out while blasting
      enemies with in Anubis, aka the Jackal Mobile! <br></li><li> <strong>Varied
      enemies</strong> - Take on a motley gang of enemies, each with their own unique
      abilities and weapons. You'll need to learn their weaknesses or accept certain
      defeat! <br></li><li> <strong>Diverse courses</strong> - Blast your way through
      bustling cityscapes, eerie wastelands, slippery snow-covered tundras, and more!
      Explore all SIX locations, each with three different versions to keep replayabiliy
      high.<br></li><li> <strong>Punishingly 80s hard</strong> - Just like the retro
      arcade games of the 1980s, this game gets progressively difficult as you play.
      How long can you last? <br></li><li> <strong>Local and online leaderboards</strong>
      - Track your personal best and see how you fair against the online community!<br></li><li>
      <strong>Original music</strong> - Jam out to the super cheesy main 80s theme
      (yet amazingly catchy) as well as the custom 8-bit tracks during gameplay! <br></li><li>
      <strong>All original characters</strong> - A profane and ridiculous ensemble
      of original characters created for this game's universe! <br></li><li> <strong>Homages</strong>
      - There are countless homages from an iconic time traveling car from an 80s
      movie to references to old video games. How many can you spot?<br></li><li>
      <strong>Adult themed</strong> - This ain't a game for the kiddos, Bub. It contains
      naughty language, adult themes, and a really puerile sense of humor that's almost
      always in bad taste. <br></li><li> <strong>Censored version</strong> - Don't
      want all the blood and sexual innuendos? Or the &quot;trying too hard&quot;
      edgy voice over? That's cool, we're not offended. We have that option, too.
      <br></li><li> <strong>Compatible with PS4 controller</strong> - Plug and play
      with the PS4 controller! (Be sure the PS4 controller support is turned off in
      Steam's controller settings)<br></li><li> <strong>Authentically retro!</strong>
      - Coded from a core module similar to OpenGL, this game uses math concepts implemented
      in Pseudo 3D games drawn in 2D vector space back in the 80s and 90s. The game
      is presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio like the old CRT monitors found in arcade
      consoles for that authentic retro feel! </li></ul>

    review: A fun arcade game.  It kind of reminds me of the old Spy Hunter arcade
      game which was my favourite arcade game back in the late eighties.  The retro
      and fuzzy retro graphics are fun but wish the text was more clear, as I can't
      read some of it as it is.
