Bad voice acting, terrible costumes (Why are there fully armored knights in the 18th century?), poor controls, no menu system, ok graphics, odd level design, large spinning item drops... basically, a very rough entry into game making.\n\nBetter design, better voice acting, and better research into the period would make this a much better game.","timestamp_created":1580459145,"timestamp_updated":1580459145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563815534114837646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48pat/e8Cf/6i7wE="}
