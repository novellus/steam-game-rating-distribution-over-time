      \ explore during day and night, and enjoy a little Christmas spirit! This prototype\

      \ in the Antarctic Bric-a-Brac Islands chain. On the surface, Knick-Knack Island\
      \ is an isolated, frozen, <br>inhospitable island, but it harbors a secret that\
      \ makes it very special and is the reason why it\u2019s the perfect place for\
      \ Santa\u2019s new toy-making outpost. What that secret is, you will have to\
      \ discover yourself...<br><br>A recent arrival on Knick-Knack Island is the\
      \ little goblin, Grimbee. He may be a bit strange and ungainly and he may also\
      \ be a bit over-his-head when it comes to many things, but for reasons yet unclear,\
      \ Santa has decided that Grimbee must be the one to turn this icy outpost into\
      \ a thriving, Christmas toy-making operation.<br><br>It\u2019s a huge responsibility\
      \ and there are a lot of big projects to take care of to grow the operation\
      \ until it is ready to make toys for all of the nice children of the world.\
      \ Organizing, managing, and even handson work, will fill much of Grimbee\u2019\
      s day...<br><br>...But it\u2019s also important to remember the little things,\
      \ like playing a game or drinking hot cocoa with a friend; because it is from\
      \ the little things, that Christmas Spirit springs.<br><br>So be merry, little\
      \ goblin! The path ahead is difficult, but with persistence and the help of\
      \ your eccentric but dedicated crew, you\u2019ll grow this little operation\
      \ into a magical toy-making wonderland, that brings joy to all the world!"
