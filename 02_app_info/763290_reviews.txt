Bunch of woo-woo puzzles based on mystic concepts like I-ching trigrams, but no logic to them whatsoever.  Somehow the mysticism of the puzzles relates to the deeds of the four fictional-real serial murderers whose lives and careers this game tries to connect in a fictional plot.  Premise possibly of interest, but what the actual puzzles and clunky execution of same have to do with the premise is hardly convincing.  Some puzzles were relatively straightforward, others like the I-ching trigrams were totally arbitrary as far as this player could tell.  I would recommend with reservations.","timestamp_created":1605512808,"timestamp_updated":1605512808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5KiB6PUCeaPXrgI="}
