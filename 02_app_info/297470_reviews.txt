It's a survival sandbox with a deep crafting system and many skills to develop with long term progression. My first 20 hours flew by and I didn't even realize time had passed. \n\nI prefer games that don't hold your hand, where you start with nothing and actually have to work for things rather than get handed them on a silver platter.  I've enjoyed the initial struggle immensely. After 16 hours of exploring, I finally found a place to call home. I managed to tame a pet dog but suddenly out of nowhere came a vicious Rottweiler and Pit Bull, which proceeded to kill both myself and my pet. I could actually see and hear the dogs consuming my dead flesh.\n\nWhen I re-spawned, my poor pet was laying half dead in a ditch. He eventually regained enough health to stand up, but the wild dogs continued to stalk me, and when my pet tried to protect me they attacked him and rendered him unconscious (again), then proceeded to kill me as well. Probably my fault for settling in one of the more dangerous areas of the map. lol","timestamp_created":1609695779,"timestamp_updated":1609695779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474934041500091553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4vW5PYCdNeRwAI="}
