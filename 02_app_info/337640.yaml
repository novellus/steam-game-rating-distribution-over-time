    review: "Inizio scrivendo , che non \xE8 come te lo aspetti , gran parte della\
      \ demo , \xE8 composta da dialoghi .\nDialoghi che riguardano dei personaggi\
      \ .\n\nL'unica parte con un brevissimo gameplay , sembra da fare senza farsi\
      \ notare , ma , non mi \xE8 chiaro se ci\xF2 funzioni Realmente o meno ,dato\
      \ che \xE8 troppo breve per stabilirlo ad una prima giocata .\n\nBei disegni\
      \ , almeno per chi ama il genere , sopratutto la protanista non umana o comunque\
      \ le sosia .\n\nDato il pochissimo gameplay non saprei dargli un voto , come\
      \ gioco , come storia e lettura avrei bisogno\nDi riguardarla , quindi se cercate\
      \ un video gioco , non provatelo , se siete appassionati del genere \nProvatelo\
      \ .\n\nps . il voto SI , \xE8 per chi piace il genere , anche se per quanto\
      \ riguarda me , non \xE8 un genere a cui gioco spesso\n      Per dare un reale\
      \ giudizio ."
