    review: So early in development that it should be completely free (it's close).
      I'm looking forward to the concept, but it's not really usable yet. CSV import/export
      was broken, so all it lets you do is render a list of items as moveable boxes
      in a VR world, but no way to get your ideas out of the VR world or save them
      for later. Other features work as advertised; teleporting controls are non-standard
      but usable.
