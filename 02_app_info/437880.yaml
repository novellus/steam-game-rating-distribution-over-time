      /><h2 class="bb_tag">About Project Graviton</h2>&quot;Project Graviton&quot;
      is a short platformer game in which users will control the character Bob, whom
      after stumbling into a secret section of his workplace, gains possession of
      a Gravity Suit and learns of its capabilities. The antagonist is Bob''s Boss,
      the creator of the gravity suit, and he tries to prevent Bob from leaving the
      building with it. The level structure is based on 3 Acts, each containing 3
      levels respectively. Players will attempt to reach the end of the levels, while
      avoiding a series of traps and hazards set by the Boss. Upon receiving the gravity
      suit, players may control their gravity to maneuver across various sections
      of the level. To balance the difficulty of the level, the game has a feature
      called &quot;Memory point&quot;, that will allow players to respawn at a chosen
      point in the level, albeit in a limited number of times. <br><br>The current
      version has a 30-60 minute (depending on skill) single-player experience to
      go through, 3 Acts (9 Total levels). A great story to unfold and challenging
      levels to come across!<br><br>Features: <ul class="bb_ul"><li> Runs at 60 FPS,

    review: Pretty fun and interesting little platformer. but it does have a major
      flaw; the checkpoints. you are allowed 3 single use checkpoints per level which
      you can place anywhere you like... on its own this isn't that bad of a system,
      but you cannot move the checkpoint once its placed, as it will use it up and
      place a new one, even if you haven't used the last one. honestly this game would
      be way better if it would just let you move unused checkpoints or if it used
      a more standard checkpointing system. its also really annoying how the game
      keeps hounding you to place checkpoints even though you only have a very limited
      supply of them. the music is pretty good though.
