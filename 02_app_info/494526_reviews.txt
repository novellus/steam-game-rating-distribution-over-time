(The installation was a little confusing as I did not see  a download occurring.) I re-ran FSX-SE, and saw there was a configuration screen for the night environment before the FSX mission screen came up.  Once flying, the city lights were very realistic.  (I'm a private pilot, SEL, MEL rated, and I have flown over the area at night.)","timestamp_created":1511660551,"timestamp_updated":1511660551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ta//+t8Cfry6jwE="}
