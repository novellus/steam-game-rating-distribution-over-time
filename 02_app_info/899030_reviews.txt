Yuasa loves to throw away the conventional norms when it comes to storytelling, and instead relies on abtract imagery and expressive characters connected loosely by a plot to tell a story. Though it may be overwhelming to take in, Mind Game was a unique experience that I'd reccomend to anyone looking for something different.","timestamp_created":1546376580,"timestamp_updated":1546376580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwusHOhegCee2YtwE="}
