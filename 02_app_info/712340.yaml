    review: "As much as I enjoyed the carrier battles of the US Pacific and Rising\
      \ Sun campaigns, Panzerkrieg is still my favorite in the Order of Battle series.\
      \  For me it is the consummate East front experience.  So many great iconic\
      \ battles here, all showcased within a system that is easy to learn and hard\
      \ to master.   There is a lot of variety and ebb and flow in this campaign which\
      \ keeps things interesting.  \n\nSome comments on most of the scenarios: \n\n\
      Ryzhev - One of the more challenging opening battles in the OoB series, and\
      \ one where you have to defend a three-sided salient in the high Russian winter,\
      \ and do it on a shoestring budget.  This one puts you to the test right out\
      \ of the gate.\n\nDemyansk - Like the previous battle, I didn't know a lot about\
      \ this one other than it happened, and it turned out to be quite interesting.\
      \  It was a 'cavalry to the rescue' situation and a dress rehearsal for the\
      \ relief of Stalingrad.  Further, most players will still be hard up for resource\
      \ points this early in the campaign, so you have to win it on a budget.  \n\n\
      Kharkov '42 - Expected this one to be a pushover for the Germans, and it was\
      \ not.  You have to quickly close the encirclement and do it with limited forces,\
      \ with the Soviets trying to break your encirclement from both within and outside\
      \ the pocket.  This battle was very tense and chaotic, and exceeded my expectations.\n\
      \nCase Blue (Voronezh and Kalach) -  The iconic drive on Stalingrad.  You do\
      \ it over two large maps and are given a lot of leeway on how you want to proceed.\
      \  Also, the Soviets are toughening up by this point (as if they weren't challenging\
      \ enough already!), and starting to deploy more T-34's and Il-2 Sturmoviks.\
      \  Also, the Night Witches was an interesting touch. \n\nStalingrad - This famous\
      \ iconic battle could have been a grindy city slog, but it was not. There's\
      \ a lot going on in this battle both within and  around the city, and as in\
      \ the historic battle one of the challenges is to not be taking excessive casualties\
      \ on your vet troops at the hands of Soviet conscripts.  \n\nWinter Storm -\
      \ This one greatly exceeded my expectations, and is one of my favorites in the\
      \ Order of Battle series.   Not only to do you have to advance with your Winter\
      \ Storm relief force against tough opposition while defending 'Fortress' Stalingrad,\
      \ but you also have to defend the Chir River line against strong Soviet attacks.\
      \  Fail in any of these three and it's game over man! \n \nOperation Star -\
      \ It's always an interesting challenge trying do a fighting withdrawal in the\
      \ face of a superior enemy, and this one was very tense and exciting.  The situation\
      \ forces you to make judicious use of engineers, and plan in advance where you\
      \ will make your stands. \n  \nKharkov '43  - Manstein's legendary 'Miracle\
      \ of the Donets'.  This was another one I expecting to be easy, and turned out\
      \ to be rather challenging.  You have to advance against a strong opponent and\
      \ think outside the box for creative solutions while you're doing it.  Also,\
      \ it's hard not to resist deploying some early Tiger tanks at this point, which\
      \ can still be quite useful despite their expense and unreliable early state.\
      \  \n\nKursk -  What better way to end this campaign than with one of the largest,\
      \ most apocalyptic battles in history.  The interesting thing about the game's\
      \ take on this epic and iconic battle is it is not quite the grindy slog I had\
      \ expected, but rather gives the player some maneuver options.  Without giving\
      \ away any spoilers, suffice to say that the devs delivered in spades here with\
      \ an epic finale worthy of the battle and the campaign.   \n\nAnyway, I highly\
      \ recommended Panzerkrieg.  Also, I would recommend prospective players doing\
      \ the Order of Battle Blitzkrieg campaign first, as you can transfer your core\
      \ force from Blitzkrieg to Panzerkrieg, but this is by no means a requirement."
