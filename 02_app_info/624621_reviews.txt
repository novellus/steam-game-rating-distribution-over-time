She's not a cheesy `murican patriot, but is actually a believable person, with a personal revenge mission.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, not many assets were reused for this one, not bad.","timestamp_created":1606570599,"timestamp_updated":1606570599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491983145475387573","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pbzEh/YCeYG7tAI="}
