It's kind of hard to review this game itself because it's clearly the final part of a Trilogy and you really should play the first two prior to this and if you like the other two well enough, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this one (it's my personal favorite of the three).  The first game is free (I think) and gives a good idea what the games are like (though 2 and 3 have some balance changes and are more fleshed out) so you would really know by now if you would like this game or not.","timestamp_created":1607377222,"timestamp_updated":1607377222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl7/Jn/YCcLaHuAI="}
