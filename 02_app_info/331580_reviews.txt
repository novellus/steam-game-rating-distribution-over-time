Abstract.\n\nNow, why do I not recommend this game?\nWell, no options menu which is a quite easy thing to implement in your game.\nThe only options you have are 2 graphics options: over-all graphics quality and V-Sync on/off, and these settings are changed via your keyboard.\nIt has no cursor speed slider, volume slider which in my opinion this game desperately needs.\nAlso, if you have sensitive eyes this game just can't be played by you. My eyes started tearing up at how bright the colours were.\nThere's a difference between an explosion of colours, and just making everything extremely bright.\n\nThe game keeps stopping you, pausing you as you play to tell you more stuff about how to the game works.\nAll that stuff, if it's not obvious, should be explained at the start of the game, not periodically throughout the entire game.\n\nYou can't jump which really puzzles me, this is the sort of game where you just involuntarily want to jump as you walk around.\n\nThe story, if you can call it that, is trying way too hard to induce philosophical thoughts, it's way too pretentious.\nThe game is trying a little too hard to take itself seriously.\n\nI enjoy the vast amount of Walking Simulators out there but this one wasn't at all what I expected it to be.\nThe graphics are terrible, yes, there is a difference between artwork and graphics, the story started getting cringeworthy and the game-play is boring.\n\n\n[h1]Curator page[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29162366/]my Curator page[/url].[/i]","timestamp_created":1485731433,"timestamp_updated":1573388024,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556122720241546631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjP/Oqu4CeIfpcA=="}
