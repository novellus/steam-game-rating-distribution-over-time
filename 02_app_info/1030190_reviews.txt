It took me 5.5 hours to play both main game and bonus chapter.  The devs have maintained the quality in this game but it was far too short and ended very quickly.  The bonus chapter was good and was full of twists and turns.\nYou are the leading expert on harmonium after all your travels.  A professor friend contacts you when a man from another world falls through her new portal.  He is ill and they don't know how to cure him.  Kraixx tell you that his world is on the brink of destruction because the harmonium there has become imbalanced.  It could affect Earth too.\nYou go back to his world and have to dodge the Watchers who arrest anyone with magical abilities.  As you travel Kraixx's world, you discover the backstory of his culture.\nIt is well done and the graphics are beautiful at times.  The music heightens the urgency of your quest.  There is a twist in the tale (which I saw coming).  There is a fair bit of backtracking, but you can fast travel through the map.  The map highlights where you can go next.\nThe HO scenes are varied which keep your interest.  You have a popper game as an option if you can't find an object.  The puzzles make you think, but are doable.  I didn't skip any.\nThere are owl collectables in every scene.  There are souvenirs too.  Both collectables can be found at the end of the game if you miss any.\nI have been left with mixed feelings with this game.  Some things are done really well, like the puzzles, some of which were quite unique.  But I thought the game finished with a rush as if they ran out of ideas.  5 hours is very short for a HO game and especially at the asked price.\nNo bugs.  7.5/10","timestamp_created":1580355568,"timestamp_updated":1580355568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6533622145652771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmIii+u8Cf5qC7wE="}
