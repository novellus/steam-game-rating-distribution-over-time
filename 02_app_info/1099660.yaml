    review: 'I always love a good time loop game and this one is pretty nice. There
      are several different variant possible though the various choices and ending.
      And the notes and map that show the information you''ve acquired through the
      timelines are a nice touch.


      However there is a bit of a downside in the choice of game engine. Not so much
      a bug as what it doesn''t have compared to other visual novels. Basically you
      have to click a button to advance the dialogue every time. You can''t skip things
      you''ve seen before, and you can''t go backwards without jumping all the way
      to a specific map checkpoint.


      It''s not bad exactly. You can click the button very quickly if you know it''s
      old information. But that also makes it possible to miss the occasional new
      bit of dialogue that pops up as you gather more timelines.


      On the whole though I would say that isn''t enough to keep me from recommending
      it to any other fan of time loop games. Though perhaps not people who are new
      to visual novels.'
