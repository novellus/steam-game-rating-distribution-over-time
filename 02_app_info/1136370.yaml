      /><br>About: Bear and Breakfast is a laid-back management adventure game where
      you play as a well-meaning bear trying to run a B+B in the woods. Hank and his
      friends find an abandoned shack and, equipped with their teenage ingenuity,
      turn it into a money-making bed and breakfast scheme for unsuspecting tourists.
      As your business expands so do the mysteries of the forest, and Hank soon finds
      himself uncovering a plot deeper than the wilderness itself.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1136370/extras/2-BuildBedrooms_BaM.gif?t=1599680275"
