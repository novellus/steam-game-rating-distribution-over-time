    review: "This DLC is for an \"adventure module\". This is not a review for this\
      \ module specifically, but a review for how these adventure modules work in\
      \ general. \n\nAs of writing this review, there is no way to redeem a physical\
      \ copy of the book that the DLC will be based on. You're basically looking at\
      \ purchasing the same book, but in a format that exclusively works with fantasy\
      \ grounds - so if you're choosing between buying a physical book and buying\
      \ this module because of economical reasons, I'd say go for the book and save\
      \ up for the fantasy grounds modules later in life. \n\nAdventure Modules for\
      \ the 5E ruleset with Fantasy Grounds are used in the same way they are in regular\
      \ D&D - as a pre-made ready-to-play module that can function as a self-contained\
      \ campaign or as part of a longer campaign. \n\nWhen you load the Adventure\
      \ Module and click the library button in the lower right corner, you will see\
      \ the adventure module listed as \"Adventure\", and you can click the title\
      \ of the module there and it will bring up a content list that you can use to\
      \ access the important content from the module, but in a format that has been\
      \ processed to be fully integrated into Fantasy Grounds - for instance, you\
      \ can open up the Pre-Generated Characters option (if the module in question\
      \ has these), and just hit the \"plus\" symbol to add the characters to the\
      \ roster or the \"magical items\" and just drag individual items into inventories\
      \ or loot-piles you're creating. \n\nYou can also click on \"Reference Manual\"\
      \ (as seems to be the case with all of the Fantasy Grounds 5E book conversion\
      \ DLCs) and it basically lets you read the book page for page, though in a slightly\
      \ cumbersome and inconvenient manner, but it works well enough that you can\
      \ prepare for a module etc.\n\nThe module will most likely contain battle-maps\
      \ of dungeons etc. that you can simply add character's to (NPC's come preplaced\
      \ on the map, except for special encounters which you have to activate), and\
      \ then the players can essentially move their \"tokens\" (fantasy ground equivalent\
      \ of miniatures) around on the map and explore it. With the new dynamic lighting\
      \ features etc., it is almost going to feel like a a video game, as tokens,\
      \ treasures and points of interest are pre-added, and most of the time, you\
      \ get a \"DM version\" of each map, allowing you to see room reference numbers\
      \ and trap locations so that you know exactly where the players are and what\
      \ should be happening in the game. \n\nAdventure Modules for Fantasy Grounds\
      \ 5E appear to be worth the money due to the sheer amount of hassle they save\
      \ the DM, but I can understand why someone would feel bitter about re-purchasing\
      \ adventure books if they already owned them, but I personally find that the\
      \ modules are no substitute for the real book - the ability to flip to a specific\
      \ page and not have to open a bunch of windows in Fantasy Grounds to look something\
      \ up is fine a must to me personally, but if I had to run a pre-made module\
      \ on Fantasy Grounds, I would definitely buy it instead of attempting to recreate\
      \ the module myself, but if I had to choose between buying the physical book\
      \ and recreating the module step-for-step or buying the fantasy grounds module\
      \ only, I'd choose the physical book any day of the week, because ultimately,\
      \ this is a poor substitute, but it is an amazing supplement. \n\nMy main gripe\
      \ is that that these supplements are the same price as the physical book, with\
      \ no option for a discount or anything. \n"
