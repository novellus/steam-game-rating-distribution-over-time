It seems to me that many reviewers compare it to AAA-tier visual novels, which in this case is unfair, or nitpick it. For a first visual novel, the amateur team has done a good job. After a relatively weak start, the story picks up and the characters' personalities (although a little bit clich√©) are interesting enough to catch your attention. However the male characters are pretty bland and one-dimensional with one or two exceptions. This VN stops after Act I, which leaves you to want more. It's unfortunate that the ending is very abrupt, I would have preferred a partial closure. Instead all the plot points are left hanging, and I'm sure they are continued in the upcoming sequel.\n\n\nThe art is top notch, the BGM is forgettable but doesn't sound like it's out of place. The script is decent enough for me to recommend it. Nonetheless the comparisons to Katawa Shoujo are justified, I can definitely see the similarities. Even though Driftwood pales in comparison, I suggest you should give it a go. I don't really get all this hate towards the game. Ok, i still haven't seen everything, but what i saw honestly isn't that bad. Most important part of VN is writing and this one is decent at least, with some good moments. Worst part is the begining. It's highly unbelievable and it feels cheap, but it gets better.\nArt isn't perfect, I've seen better, but I also have seen much, much worse many times. Artist who drew characters can get very good soon, if she/he still practice.\nYes, I have to agree with some people that it kinda feels like Katawa Shoujo rip off, but is it that bad if you get your ideas from the best?\nI really wanted to see how it ends so i hope one day i'll get another chapter","timestamp_created":1486676998,"timestamp_updated":1486676998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw99a2ktoCdY3ccQ=="}
