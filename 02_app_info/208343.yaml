    about_the_game: "The Class 390 is a modern classic, and you can experience the\
      \ speed of this powerful tilting express train from the driver\u2019s seat in\
      \ Train Simulator. <br><br>The Class 390 is one of the fastest electric multiple\
      \ units operating in Britain. The set can reach 140 mph, whilst featuring tilting\
      \ train technology to allow higher speeds around bends. At present, the Class\
      \ 390 operates along the West Coast Main Line and is well-known to commuters\
      \ and railfans alike for its sleek looks and high performance. In 2006 a Class\
      \ 390 set a new speed record along the West Coast Main Line, completing the\
      \ 401-mile trip from London to Glasgow in 3 hours and 55 minutes, and in usual\
      \ operation the sets will run up to 125mph where track conditions allow. The\
      \ Class 390 for Train Simulator recreates the smooth high performance well-known\
      \ to drivers on the West Coast Main Line, and features a realistic tilting function\
      \ which mimics the action of the real thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Includes:</h2><br>Class\
