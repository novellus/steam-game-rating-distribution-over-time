    review: "Mi dispiace davvero perch\xE8 apprezzo lo sforzo fatto dai realizzatori\
      \ di questo gioco ma ho dovuto richiedere il rimborso dopo un'ora circa di gioco.\n\
      La storia \xE8 appena abbozzata, i personaggi entrano in scena senza nessuna\
      \ logica, semplicemente appaiono dal nulla, il sistema di combattimento non\
      \ \xE8 spiegato con nessun tutorial e sebbene sia piuttosto semplice ( forse\
      \ anche troppo ) si ha l'idea di non sapere bene come utilizzare tutte le tecniche.\n\
      Il passaggio di livello avviene senza poter personalizzare nulla e si scalano\
      \ livelli a tre alla volta senza nessuna logica.\nPeccato perch\xE8 l'idea poteva\
      \ anche essere buona."
