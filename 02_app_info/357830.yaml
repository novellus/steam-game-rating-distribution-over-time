    review: "A fun fast-paced game that really is a lot better with some friends on\
      \ couch co-op, as it tends to get a little repetitive over the various stages.\
      \ Level design is fun, controls are great, music definitely sounds good too.\n\
      \nAs for opportunities to be evil: Few. But friendly fire can be a thing, so\
      \ there's always betraying your friends!\n\u0B67\u0F3C\u0CA0\u76CA\u0CB0\u0CC3\
