    review: I have to argue that it isn't worth 15 dollars for the game, although
      it is fun its not worth 15 dollars. Its one of those games that you play for
      30 minutes then get bored and regret buying it, it isn't worth 15 dollars at
      all to me. Very little content in my option for a 15 dollar game, would not
      recommend for price
