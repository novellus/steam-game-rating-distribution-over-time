It's basically a 'play until you die' game, where the whole idea is just to run around shooting stuff. I picked it up half off and I'd say my money was well spent. It has enough complexity to keep you engaged, it's very pretty, and the controls are smooth. It's less than the price of a coffee at starbucks and gave me three hours of enjoyment so I'd say it's very good. Just don't go in expecting anything and it will reward you richly.","timestamp_created":1609212193,"timestamp_updated":1609212193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jq2h1vYCeuuovgI="}
