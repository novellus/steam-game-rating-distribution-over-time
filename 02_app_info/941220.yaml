      \ feel when you\u2019ve successfully purchased, downloaded, and played a volume\
      \ of <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i>. Luckily for you, round 12 is here to fulfill\
      \ that weirdly narrow definition for you. Enjoy the sweet, sweet feeling of\
      \ having burrowed your way into these two hearts. You deserve it.<br><br>---<br><br>You\
      \ just crash-landed on Alternia, and you\u2019re DESPERATE for friendship! Anyone\
      \ will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap\
      \ Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following\
      \ the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that\u2019s you!) to survive and maybe\
      \ even thrive on the harsh surface of <strong>ALTERNIA</strong>. Set in the\
      \ time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel\u2019s opening\
      \ volume, written by <i>Homestuck</i> creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>,\
      \ is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager\
      \ for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes\
      \ will arrive regularly as DLC."

      notes: "Violence:\r\n\r\nThere is violence (including death) in Tirona's route,\
        \ but it is not \"frequent.\" There is no physical violence in Galekh's route,\
        \ but there are a couple of medium-level threats. \r\n\r\nSexual content:\r\
        \n\r\nThere are vague references to nudity and sexual content in Galekh's\
        \ route but nothing depicted on-screen."
