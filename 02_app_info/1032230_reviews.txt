With a wide array of graphic options - ranging from Low for the lower performing of us gamers, to Ultra for the game beasts - this game presents breathtaking visuals no matter which option you choose. The gameplay is challenging yet enjoyable, with the levels introducing new elements every so often while maintaining the use of previous ones. This piece of work is definitely worth its price and your time","timestamp_created":1553563590,"timestamp_updated":1574801542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53947371244430542","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt5Hf1O4Ce5rqvQE="}
