I adore its style and mood, but at the moment the game is essentially a multiplayer asset tour with a handful of cute but gimmicky interactive elements. There is very little to bring you back into its world once you've explored it, and none of the interactive elements seem to contribute to the social environment. There are free Social VR titles with more content, more customizability, and a much more stable technological framework.\n\nI can't help but feel like the developers are shooting themselves in the foot by revealing the game so early and with such a high price tag. If the game was free or significantly cheaper it would stand as a neat experience to check in on once in a while, but I have a feeling loads of people will pursue a refund while they still can.\n\nI hope that the developers are able to stay on course and flesh out their world because it really does have the potential to become something very unique and interesting. I'm just not so sure that anyone is going to feel compelled to stick around until then.","timestamp_created":1497566562,"timestamp_updated":1497566562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597244441509246826","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw7Yj71twCfL3new=="}
