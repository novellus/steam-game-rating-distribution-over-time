      \ on making the best looking city they can yet still have to that element of\
      \ micro management. In this game, you will have the ability to 'jump off grid'\
      \ and build a city reminiscent of old medieval villages with natural flowing\
      \ organic growth, adapting to the terrain instead of controlling it. Start of\
      \ at the basic level, a small camp in an unexplored land and spend your time\
      \ building it up to a bustling town full of peasants for you to please..<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nPeasants also puts a focus on building up your villagers,\
      \ keeping them happy, improving their skills and utilizing them as best you\
      \ can. Implementing a soft RPG system into each peasant allows them to have\
      \ traits and skills that make them better or worse at tasks, jobs or just living.\
      \ Do you keep the old woman with warts? She might be good at brewing potions\
      \ but nobody wants to live anywhere near her! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJump in, get\
      \ lost in the world and spend hours adding the little details that make 'Your\
      \ village YOUR village'."
