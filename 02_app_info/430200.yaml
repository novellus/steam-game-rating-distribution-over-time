    review: 'This DLC is quite special as it is a direct sequel to the end content
      of the base game + OST but I may be tad expensive for the original price.  However,
      I definitely recommend picking up the dlc when it is on sale!


      As for the actual content Nameless ~Black & White Christmas~ which focuses on
      the secret character, there is no words for how emotional the feelings that
      are being conveyed. You feel a greater sense of understanding of the character
      and closure that is being convey to the main character. Not to mention the bgm
      blended perfectly with each change of scene or mood. It was nice the developers
      decide to release the translations to the audio book in pdf format along side
      with the cover scans.


      The only downside is that the translations for commentary track from thevoice
      actor(Taeyeol Jeon) was omitted from the pdf. Regardless, the overall feel of
      the audio tracks and OST is well polished.


      I grew to love the character a lot more through the DLC, so please give this
      DLC a chance to amaze you.
