      /><br>Christmas Cats Revenge is a Christmas themed 2D Platform Action game based
      on the story of the war which broke out between Kim Cats and Kon Cats Kingdoms.
      <br><br>The workers of the &quot;Kim Cats&quot; kingdom were packing the Christmas
      gifts diligently for all the kids of the Kingdom in order to make the Christmas
      day a memorable one for them. But three days before the Christmas, the &quot;Kim
      Cats&quot; Kingdom got attacked by the Army of &quot;Kon Cats&quot; Kingdom.
      All of the Christmas gifts had been destroyed by the enemies and even some of
      the Kim Army men were killed in the process. A day before the Christmas, Leo,
      the Army General of the Kim Cats Kingdom was sent to the enemy territory to
      forcibly collect the Christmas gifts and to bring them over to the Kim Cats
      kingdom to make up for the loss. The King also commanded him to eliminate the
      enemies especially those who interfere with his mission. <br><br>Will Leo be
      able to collect the Christmas gifts and successfully bring them over to his
      Kingdom? Will he be able to bring smile to the faces of all of the cats in the
      Kingdom? Only you can make it happen! Are you ready for the battle?  <br><br><img
