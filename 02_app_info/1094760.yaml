      /><br>Currently, Stonedeep has five civilization levels. Every civilization
      level increases your daily tax income but also increases the needs of the involved
      residents. In Stonedeep similar to the really world there is a limited amount
      of Gold coins (money). You have to spend your money to get it back from your
      residents.<h2 class="bb_tag">Current Status</h2>Stonedeep currently includes
      43 resources, 50 different blocks, 28 buildings, 12 professions, five civilization
      levels, and five types of adversaries and animals.<h2 class="bb_tag">Plans for
      the Future</h2>A total of four milestones are planned to expand and optimize
      these game components. In addition, other features and challenges will be added
      that offer players more game variations, scope for action and entertainment.
      This includes, for example, an extensive system with gears, through which the
      players can largely automate their productions. Mine wagons and elevators are
      also integrated to expand the transport system. Weather and seasons are also
      introduced as a further challenge when managing and planning. Combative game
      scenarios become much more complex and interesting for the players, among other
      things, through a more extensive combat system, additional adversaries and defense
      options as well as new professions. In addition, the game expands in the course
      of the project by another 40 resources, 22 blocks, 24 buildings, 4 civilization
      levels, 5 professions and 14 adversaries and animal species.<br><br><br><img

      notes: "Stonedeep is a building game that is supposed to simulate the management\
        \ and planning of a civilization. Due to the comic-like and fairytale-like\
        \ graphic style, there is no everyday reference. This makes it possible for\
        \ 12- to 15-year-olds to differentiate the game world from reality and to\
        \ distance themselves from the game. The observer perspective also creates\
        \ a distinction between the players and reality.\r\nMilitary and fighting\
        \ game scenarios are graphically depicted in such a way that they are clearly\
        \ fictitious for this age group. The depiction of violence in combat scenarios\
        \ is also perceived as unrealistic, since the adversaries are fantastic creatures\
        \ and they are represented in a comic-like manner. Thus, there is no reference\
        \ to everyday life and the behavior shown is not used to resolve conflicts.\
        \ Threats and conflicts that arise do not span the entire game.\r\nThe audiovisual\
        \ means only serve to create the atmosphere. The game also contains fighting\
        \ sounds that only serve to point out what is happening. Combat scenarios\
        \ should not be visually or auditory disturbing or emotionally damaging.\r\
        \nThe pressure to act that arises in the course of the game and the associated\
        \ coping with game tasks must be accomplished for 12 to 15 year olds. More\
        \ complex tasks and problems require the ability to think abstractly and logically,\
        \ which is also appropriate for this age group."
