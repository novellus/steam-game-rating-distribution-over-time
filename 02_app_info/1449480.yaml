    review: The first one was much very better programmed. In this one the robots
      have a quite erratic and different bvehavior, the platforms are slippery, you
      cant' jump through doors (try jumping passing trought the elevator! I always
      loved to do that). The graphics are fuzzy and everything sounds fake. The chessboard
      game have strange sounds and they could have at least added the mouse functionality!
      Total shame, the original was way better than this.
