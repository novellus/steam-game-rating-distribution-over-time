    review: I am only a few minutes into this game but I am absolutely charmed by
      the simplicity of the challenge. Too many chess games are a boring take on the
      same old game but this is exactly what I want! I frankly dislike chess because
      it bores me. This variant offers all the things I feel are lacking in generic
      chess games, puzzle, tactics, RPG like mystery & something of a progressive
      challenge. For the price of the game I cannot recommend this highly enough!
