Completed over the course of 3 days, about 5 hours total of gameplay.\n\nAstrohazard Solutions Ltd. combines Asteroids-reminiscent gameplay with a good story about the employees of an unethical corporation. The company earns its profit by removing space junk, asteroids, and other hazards away from its clients' property. You are the Operator of your team, controlling the drone that must push these hazards away before the object you're protecting gets damaged. The problem? This company might be bent TOO much on profits over ethics.\n\nGame missions are fun, have some variety, can have amusing twists to them, and are integrated into the progressing plot. Initially I found that the difficulty levels and controls were perfectly balanced, with some challenge but still doability to each mission. However, as I upgraded my stats and became more strategic with my gameplay, I came to a point where many later missions could be completed easily by staying in one spot on the screen and pushing everything away from there. I would have liked more chances to have the AstroTractor and AstroMines be useful instead of relying solely on the AstroBeam/AstroShield; to have to move around more on the screen to remove hazards; and would have been happy with harder difficulties and longer levels.\n\nThe story is about the same level of complexity as the gameplay. It's straightforward but successful, with thought about the dangers of an unethical corporation, good points of humor and personality, and noticeable characterization within the main cast.","timestamp_created":1541123944,"timestamp_updated":1541124082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlemJ6eYCdrDtrQE="}
