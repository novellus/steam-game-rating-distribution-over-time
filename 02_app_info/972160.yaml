      /><br>On the edge of the Rose Village shopping district there stands an old,
      worn-down barbershop, and in the barbershop there lives a girl named Alice.
      Alice goes to school with her friends at Hekihou Academy, where she''s a member
      of the photography club.  She lives alone except for her pet dog Qoo, and she
      holds down a part-time job as a waitress at Dragon Burger. Her life is busy
      and content, but sometimes she feels like there''s something she''s forgetting,
      something she''s left undone. Maybe even something important.<br><br>One day,
      Alice and her friends visit the clock tower. There, an unusual book falls into
      Alice''s lap: the diary of a mysterious young man. And that''s where their story
      begins...<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/972160/extras/Character1.png?t=1580430909"

    review: 'A surreal and sometimes confusing but ultimately interesting read.


      The basic premise is deceptively simple. Our protagonist, Alice Nanno, one day
      finds a mysterious book (aptly named "The Witch''s Love Diary") that contains
      stories about herself and her friends that seemingly never happened in reality.


      I won''t spoil it any further than that, but suffice to say that the mystery
      only grows more involved the more you go into the game. It''s a fantastic and
      wild ride to uncover the truth behind the Witch''s Love Diary and I''d recommend
      it to anyone looking for a romance novel stirred with a mix of fantasy into
      it.


      That said, there is one thing that stood out to me, so much so that I actually
      have to consider it a negative point against the game:


      There are a [i]lot[/i] of sex scenes. Like, a LOT. Compared to most other VN''s
      I''ve read where the sex is mostly isolated to the most important/climatic moments,
      The Witch''s Love Diary has one, like, every 15-20 minutes of reading. This
      may make it either more or less interesting to you, but I found it detracted
      more than what it added and drew too much attention away from the story being
      told behind the scenes. It got to the point where I''d go "oh come on, not [i]again[/i]"
      because it was interrupting the flow of the story often at the most important
      moments.


      Speaking of story, this VN is one of the ones that does that thing where it
      gives you the illusion of a branching story (there are several choices you can
      make throughout) but they all ultimately lead to the same endings, just in a
      different order. That''s worth keeping in mind if you do decide to pick up the
      game; don''t worry too much about which choices you make, it ultimately doesn''t
      matter because you''ll have to see all of the scenes regardless. I actually
      prefer the kinetic novel style more, so this works out for me (it may not for
      you).


      Now, in terms of playability, The Witch''s Love Diary has more or less all the
      features you''d expect out of a modern VN: quicksave, quickload, skip, message
      log, CG/music/movie gallery, scene replay, the whole nine yards. Nothing really
      to complain about there.


      Overall, I''d give it a recommend. The price point is more or less average for
      this kind of VN, and it [i]is[/i] actually quite long, so I''d say it''s worth
      it to pick it up at full price if it interests you.'
