      Regarding to highlighting circles with correct number of lines: In case of correct
      number of lines but wrong directions users may be disappointed and think that
      highlighted circles are done when they aren''t, so we decided not to highlight
      them :)

    review: '"seven red lines" is a logic puzzle similar to "Hashiwokakero" but with
      the ability to overlap and link diagonally. There are 147 custom-made levels
      and a random-generator for endless game-play.   Some of them are guaranteed
      to tie your brain in knots.  All this accompanied by three awesome electronic  scores.'
