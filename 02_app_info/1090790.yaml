      [b]edit:[/b] managed to finish the game with some outside help (see the guides
      section), so added more info about the second half.


      [b]magicolors[/b] is a fun voxel-based puzzler (think lego or minecraft). playing
      as a newbie wizard, you have to collect energy by shooting spells through 3
      crystals at a time and only of the same color. with enough energy new spells
      can be unlocked, one in each location for a total of 5 spells, since you start
      with the basic one.


      it''s all about positioning your character and finding the right angle (and
      the right spell), which is a bit tricky since it''s a 3d game and there are
      often obstacles in the way, but you can [b]rotate the levels by 90 degrees[/b]
      in either direction and there''s a top-down view as well, and after the latest
      patch it doesn''t go back to isometric after every move or shot, which is excellent.
      still [b]no undo[/b] though.


      left click moves (no matter the distance, counts as one move), right click shoots,
      there are hotkeys and on-screen buttons for rotating and changing the viewpoint
      (not for restart), and objects can be set to disappear when the cursor is over
      them, so they''re not in the way at least visually, it''s a nice quality of
      life feature.


      the [b]3-star rating system[/b] is based on the number of moves and shots (there''s
      no timer), but [b]simply completing the level unlocks the next[/b] even without
      getting any stars. only one is available at a time though, so if you get stuck,
      all you can do is keep trying until you can progress. also, [b]level goals are
      only visible on the level complete screen[/b], something that should be addressed.
      you''re unlikely to 3-star later levels on the first try, but it''d still be
      more convenient to see what to aim for.


      there are [b]64 levels in 4 unique locations with their own spells[/b], starting
      at home, moving on to the ice mountain, and so on. once you unlock a spell,
      it can be used going forward, but not when replaying earlier levels when the
      spell wasn''t available. you start with the [u]collect[/u] spell, needed to
      grab the energy from the crystals on every level. [u]push[/u] unlocks in the
      first world, self-explanatory, but it''s important that crates can be pushed
      diagonally as well. [u]freeze[/u] is next, spells can ricochet off frozen surfaces,
      but lava blocks can''t be frozen. then there''s [u]fire[/u] to unfreeze or destroy
      objects, including lava blocks. and finally, [u]energy[/u] to activate or deactivate
      pistons that raise or lower blocks on top of them. they can be frozen but not
      destroyed.


      separate volume sliders are available, windowed mode with a resizable window
      as well. [b]the graphics are great (I like voxels), the music is excellent[/b]
      (especially on the ice levels), but the writing is a bit awkward, what little
      there is.


      it''s really cheap and fun, there are even some general hints from the wizard
      if you''re not using a spell right, but I still got stuck before reaching the
      halfway point. everything was going fine, then suddenly [b]ice mountain 12[/b]
      is somehow a huge spike in difficulty, as well as the last level in that pack,
      and the second half also has plenty of challenges.


      [b]I definitely recommend getting it[/b], but it''d be even better with undo,
      on-screen goals, a few more hotkeys, a line to see where the spell will go without
      wasting a shot, more than one level unlocked at a time, and a bit faster walking
      speed.'
