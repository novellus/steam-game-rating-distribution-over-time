Describing their genre as \"Science Fiction Rock\", they hit the point. Being \"spacy\" and rock together, they either can calm you, or boost you to levels way beyond your thoughts. \n\nI'd consider a compiliation to consist out of more songs though... the [i]only[/i] negative remark I had to make, since I am missing the OST of Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken still... and then, on the other hand, the ones from Rocketbirds 2 Evolution. But things might take their time - I will keep these as my wishes for future updates.\n\nIt is all up to you to listen to this or not. If not, you will definitely miss something. But hey, it was your choice, cannot blame you for that or your different taste of music. :D\n\n\nAgent R out!\n\n[b]P.S.: You can support New World Revolution outside of Steam [url=https://newworldrevolution.bandcamp.com]here[/url] - they have loads of good stuff on their bandcamp page, including both of the full Rocketbirds soundtracks![/b]","timestamp_created":1486333083,"timestamp_updated":1607831497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61276090145111084","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4krWOrfYCduC0cQ=="}
