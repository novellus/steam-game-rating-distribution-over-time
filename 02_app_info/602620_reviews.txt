There are 12 missions, which are pretty straightforward and not too technical, but challenging nevertheless. The campaign has a bit of voice-over for situation updates and communication with ground units.\n\nPlayed on Stable 2.5.6 in 2020, mission 3 is a bit buggy due to AI ground units getting stuck, which is a common issue also with other campaigns.\nIf this happens, [spoiler] kill stuck trucks but avoid the truck where the target is hiding and which will try to sneak back by the checkpoint. This truck might return to the road too far beyond the checkpoint resulting in mission failure, in which case you will have to try again.
