    review: 'Wow, what an awful game.  I played the original Ultimate Domain so much
      when I was a kid that I have all 5 maps memorized.  But if you''re expecting
      to wage war with old Karnak and Sun Tzu, think again.  After 15 minutes, I got
      in a loop of collecting unlimited resources without ever being allowed to capture
      standards to expand my empire, or ever given new settlers to fill my empty houses.  I
      never caught a glimpse of any other civilization and was blocked from making
      multiple workshops or inventors, so inventing crawled along at a snail''s pace.  There
      wasn''t anything to do but watch animals move back and forth as my villagers
      continued stockpiling huge amounts of gold and resources to no purpose.  The
      only thing to break up the tedium was random attacks by brigands.


      To add insult to injury, the graphics and gameplay feel like just a cheapo Chinese
      mobile strategy game, and the game inserts all sorts of juvenile sound effects
      and dialogue such as burping, farting, sex noises, diarrhea noises, etc.'
