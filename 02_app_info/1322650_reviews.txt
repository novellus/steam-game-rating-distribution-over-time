There's no real gimmick, you just jump and walljump your way level to level collecting keys and gold coins as you go along. The game doesn't really need anything extra though, the simplicity of the controls and superb level design are more than enough. However, the game goes a step beyond with a polished graphical style and great sound design. If you're a fan of these types of games, I can't recommend it enough. A great challenge and easily worth the asking price.","timestamp_created":1609483986,"timestamp_updated":1609483986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxZSu3vYCfKCpvwI="}
