      \ on the Southern region. The trains are used extensively on services in south\

      \ to, but not based on the 'Highspeed' livery carried by the high speed Class\
      \ 395 EMU, with a more vibrant shade of blue on the saloon doors and bolder\
      \ stripes to highlight First Class and Disabled areas. Internally, the unit\
      \ has received new carpets and lino flooring, new table top covers and the grab\
      \ poles, side panels and table legs have been re-powdercoated. The existing\
