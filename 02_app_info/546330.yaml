    reviews: "\u201CEven though it was developed on very primitive hardware, Space\
      \ Mouse is still a remarkable achievement in game design. The challenge isn't\
      \ just in having quick reflexes, but also in planning ahead, reading situations,\
      \ and knowing when to move. It's a uniquely rewarding jolt of arcade action,\
      \ and the effective presentation lends everything the right amount of charm.\
      \ This is a fine blast from the past that'll satisfy anyone with an open mind.\u201D\

    review: Charming little game. Historically interesting with all the retro versions.
      Good music & tiny pixel art on the "NES-Like Arrange" mode. The game's basic
      concept is original but it's got sort of a similar vibe to Burgertime or Amidar;
      you know how all the parts are going to move but the danger is in losing track.
