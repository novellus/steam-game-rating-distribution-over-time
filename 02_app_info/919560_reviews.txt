I left a few guides in order to help as I saw that there was not even one.\n\nHowever, I must say that the game is dead and the only purpose is for its achievements.\n\nOverall, it is recommend if you want to get some easy 100% achievements.","timestamp_created":1595753957,"timestamp_updated":1595753957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46KCWxfMCc8jPlwI="}
