That experience was magical and I still remember it today and was able to share many music tracks around the world. I love the vision this company has for making creative software that can be applied by the most amateur users. Unfortunately this Video Deluxe is not the experience I remember from years ago. This is not for amateur users but advanced users. With that said I can't say this software is bad simply because I cannot use it comfortably but it definitely is not for me. No matter how much I attempt to smoothly transition from task to task I encounter long durations of searching...searching.....searching for the correct function. Just pausing my video while editing was difficult, not a pause button in site. To advanced users this will sound silly but for beginners a smooth, expeditious UI is absolutely paramount. The features layout is done well but when I begin to open them up and attempt to apply them the experience just slowly falls apart. The moral of this review is this editing software is not a quick learning experience so buckle up and get ready to study the UI for a while. For some users this is expected and welcomed but for myself, I simply want to make reasonably short edits with just a few effects and be done with it. I only wish I could give this software away to someone with the patience and or experience to make good use of it as it is most definitely packed with tools and features editors would love. Not for me I'm afraid.","timestamp_created":1605623457,"timestamp_updated":1605623457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zrSn6/UCfYv5rgI="}
