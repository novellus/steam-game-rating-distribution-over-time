    review: "So this seemed like it could be an interesting enough premise. Whack-a-mole\
      \ with zombies. Not exactly groundbreaking, but maybe some arcadey fun.\n \n\
      This game though, isn't very good. The basic mechanics are hitting zombies or\
      \ digging holes for zombies to fall into. This is made much more difficult since\
      \ the controls are terrible, and your character slides around like he's in a\
      \ Mario ice level. You don\u2019t exactly slide so it\u2019s not a perfect description\
      \ but that\u2019s the best way I can think to describe it. I tried playing with\
      \ both controller and keyboard and while keyboard was slightly more bearable\
      \ I would not say I had a good time. The whack-a-mole part is pretty precise\
      \ in registering a hit, and you have to be fast, so anything being awkward about\
      \ the controls is a very bad thing.\n\nOne thing I found strange was the gravestones\
      \ (which the enemies spawn from) being randomly generated, which meant that\
      \ sometimes a level would be hard since the graves were far apart and the controls\
      \ suck, but then on retrying it all the graves would be in one corner making\
      \ the level stupidly easy. It seems like actually planning out the levels with\
      \ the gravestone placement would make for a better experience, especially since\
      \ the levels increase in difficulty as the game progresses and adds more enemy\
      \ types and mechanics. Enemies\u2019 spawning is literally the only thing you\
      \ have to manage while playing so the randomness just seems like poor design.\
      \ \n\nThe game is still pretty easy until the introduction of ghosts around\
      \ level 8 or so, random spawns aside. The ghosts are honestly terrible. When\
      \ an enemy hits you, you become stunned for a few seconds. Ghosts can hit you,\
      \ but the only way to kill them is with a random pickup - the crucifix. However,\
      \ as soon as you kill one another spawns, so it's pretty pointless. The problem\
      \ with the ghosts is that they often stand over the graves as zombies are spawning,\
      \ meaning you can't get to the zombie and kill it. The ghost just wanders around\
      \ randomly so sometimes a couple of zombies will just be blocked off with nothing\
      \ you can do about it. And it\u2019s not like you can just dig holes to get\
      \ around this, since you can\u2019t dig on tiles with gravestones and skeletons\
      \ take 2 holes to kill, which you often don\u2019t have time or room for (and\
      \ keep in mind this entire time how bad the game feels to control). I don't\
      \ mind challenge, but having like 2 mechanics in a game and then randomly making\
      \ some enemies guaranteed to get past is really annoying (and the game isn't\
      \ exactly fun to begin with).\n\nThe sound design is also pretty dreadful. The\
      \ music is generic atmospheric stuff, bland but inoffensive. But there's this\
      \ weird and off-putting 70's porn music that plays when you pick up tequila\
      \ (kind of like this game's version of the fruit in pacman, letting you jump\
      \ on the zombies and kill them faster) and in the main menu mousing over any\
      \ of the options plays a weird sound of what I think is someone saying \"dig\"\
      \ but it sounds more like \"dink\" and is just weird. When you complete a level\
      \ it tallies up the enemies you killed and plays an 8-bit chirp for each one\
      \ making each level end with what is basically a burst of static.\n\nIt's pretty\
      \ easy but becomes very tedious since every time you fail a stage it shows a\
      \ game over screen and kicks you back to the main menu where you have to select\
      \ the stage again. Not a huge issue but adding a retry level option or something\
      \ doesn't seem that hard. \nThe game is also very short. It took me like 30\
      \ minutes to beat all 12 levels even with the annoying controls, and after that\
      \ I just played it a while longer for the cards. The last level changes things\
      \ up with a flamethrower and no powerups but it's not really any better. Really\
      \ not worth the money it's being sold for, or any money at all in my opinion."
