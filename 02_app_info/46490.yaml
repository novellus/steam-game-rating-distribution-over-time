    review: "Oh boy. Worst follow up to two good games since Penumbra Requiem maybe?\
      \ Granted Requiem at least tried something new while failing. Still Life 2 is\
      \ just a very worst version of a good game. And that sucks because you kind\
      \ of need to play it to get the complete ending to the main plot of the first\
      \ one.\n\nI'm going to go rather in depths with every aspects of this one. If\
      \ you are just not interested in the details, I have TL;DR section in the end\
      \ for you. But this one hurts a bit, so I need to relieve the stress and anguish\
      \ of going through it.\n\n-Production value:\n\nVisually speaking, it's ugly\
      \ by 2009 standard, the year of Assassin's Creed II, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves\
      \ or Batman: Arkham Asylum. But even compared to a 2004 game (let's sayyy...Still\
      \ Life 1) it appalling. The backgrounds are not pre-rendered this time, leaving\
      \ us with over-exposed, badly textured, and washed out places, lacking the grit\
      \ and the details any screen of Still Life, hell even Post Mortem could provide.\
      \ Oh, there are travelling cameras now, that's a thing. The character models\
      \ look worse than the first, though I can't say if it's because of the inept\
      \ animations or the light. The character goes bonker everytime you try to align\
      \ the way the game wants you to look at something. The game doesn't let you\
      \ change gamma or brightness, so you are stuck with the bright visuals that\
      \ don't work. It just looks silly and every attempt at cinematography falls\
      \ irremediably flat on its face.\n\nThat's a problem since Still Life 2 is a\
      \ serious noire detective story at heart and the atmosphere greatly suffers\
      \ from the visuals. But you know what? My favorite game from a year later was\
      \ Deadly Premonition. So it looks bad, but I'd be okay with that.\n\nWell it\
      \ sounds bad too. In Still Life 2, there is even less direction than the previous\
      \ two. Claire is the only okay voice in the game, and the rest is juste soooo\
      \ bad. The vilain, especially considering how important having him being threatening\
      \ is to the tension of the game, is so cheesy; every single moment of intimidation\
      \ in the Saw-like moments of the game, I was rolling my eyes. And let's just\
      \ avoid the whole \"lipsynch\" part to not upset anyone.\n\nThe sound design\
      \ uses basic samples, repetitive loops for every room (the damned rats e_e)\
      \ and sometimes flat out doesn't work, with muted scenes here and there. But\
      \ the music is not bad.\n\n-The actual game:\n\nOkay, so it looks cheap, is\
      \ sounds cheap, we got it. What's the game though? Well, it's a less than mediocre\
      \ P&C. And I guess this is mostly a lack of talent and/or experience from the\
      \ team at GameCo that did only this one game.\n\nSo far, I judged the game in\
      \ comparison to the previous titles in the saga. I don't think it's uninteresting\
      \ or unfair (I mean I did it, so I'm okay with that) but at some point I need\
      \ to actually explain why it can't even be good on its own terms. And most of\
      \ the problems could have been avoided with the exact same budget, and arguably\
      \ with even less money.\n\nThe controls:\nBelieve it or not, Still Life 2 has\
      \ bad controls, which is a first as far as can recall for a P&C adventure game.\
      \ The great thing about this genre or at least this presentation of this genre,\
      \ is the fact that it's easy to pick up; you just click where you want to go\
      \ or on the things you want to interact with. Whereas in any P&C with pre-rendered\
      \ backgrounds (2D and 3D) you have often clear indications of where to exit\
      \ or enter a screen, with a system like the one in Still Life 2, you can't just\
      \ click on the place you want to go. Since you are in a 3D space with fixed\
      \ but not too fixed cameras, you kind of need to push your character towards\
      \ the edges of a screen/scene so that the camera changes, before clicking on\
      \ where you want to go. Except it doesn't work smoothly. It's like playing Resident\
      \ Evil with momentum in the movement. And believe me, it can be annoying even\
      \ in small spaces. \n\n\nThe second problem is the hitboxes of the objects;\
      \ you have those who are a bit small for the size of the object, and then you\
      \ have a few that are plain and simple not on the object itself. Not that big\
      \ of a deal overall, but you can miss object you've clicked on ten times before.\n\
      \nYou also have a skip button for the dialogues BUT, though you can skip the\
      \ lines alright, you don't always skip the animation linked to it; meaning if\
      \ there is a five seconds animation of your character saying \"what is this\
      \ blood?\" and you skip the sound, you still get to see the full animation.\n\
      \nAll of this make for a very tedious game to just explore. And that's too bad\
      \ because I kind of like the direction they were going with the gameplay.\n\n\
      -The mechanics:\nYou are playing several characters, one of them being Victoria,\
      \ main character of Still Life, and the other being stuck with the killer, dealing\
      \ with his shinanigans (I guess Saw/Hostel was still popular in 2009). So with\
      \ Victoria, you have a detective story; you search places, try to establish\
      \ connections, and find all the items. And with the other character, you have\
      \ more a classic P&C experience with a puzzle in every room, but contextualized\
      \ as a sadistic game made up by the killer.\n\nFine. Except no. And I need to\
      \ be specific for this part.\n\n-I guess that we've...found our manYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\n\
      With Victoria you have three things to keep track of: 1) a cellphone, 2) a CSI\
      \ kit, 3) an grid-based inventory. \n\n1) With the cellphone you can look at\
      \ the dossier on the killer,informations you gathered, and you can call Claire\
      \ the coroner to update the case with the informations you found. This is cumbersome\
      \ in terms of navigation but more problematic, it's unclear. You especially\
      \ don't really know when to call Claire because some information you find can\
      \ seem important but aren't to the game. And sometimes she is the one calling\
      \ you to update you on a clue you found and again, you don't know why now and\
      \ not earlier or later. So it's inconsistent. In the middle of the game, you\
      \ need to find every godam clue in a three story house complete with hidden\
      \ rooms, back yard, front yard, balcony...and if you miss something that the\
      \ game wants for Claire to call, you need to search EVERYWHERE again.\n\n2)\
      \ The CSI kit is alright by my book. It's just a neat diegetic gate between\
      \ you and plot points..\n\n3) This serve absolutely no purpose except slowing\
      \ down exploration and puzzle solving. It has no element of choice to it so\
      \ reason to exist for Vic or the other character.\n\nAnd all this makes the\
      \ investigation more tedious than compelling, engaging or involving. You don't\
      \ have more tools to analyse the crime scenes or surmise where the scenario\
      \ is going. You just have more layers between you and picking up an object.\
      \ And even though I kind of like the CSI kit for the immersion factor, it's\
      \ not interesting mechanically\n\n-I want to play a game...\nAnd with the second\
      \ character you need to keep track of: 1) a recorder, 2) a cellphone, 3) the\
      \ same grid-based inventory system.\n\n1) Doesn't serve much purpose except\
      \ with a couple of puzzles that uses information from a recording. And that's\
      \ fine.\n\n2) Doesn't work most of the time so...yeah.\n\n3) I already said\
      \ that it didn't make sense in this game.\n\n-The puzzles\nI do realise that\
      \ I didn't even mention the challenge. Well, there are no contender to the worst\
      \ lock-picking mini-game ever; that honor still goes to Still Life (second being\
      \ Post Mortem). That's a good thing. Other than that, it's not a hard game.\
      \ You get stuck only when you didn't search well enough\n\n\nTL;DR If not for\
      \ the controls and the convoluted ways you interact with the clues and items,\
      \ it would be a mediocre to (sometimes) decent P&C with a dumb storyline. But\
      \ the tedium of just manipulating the character, the mind boggling choice of\
      \ having this grid-based inventory and the overall botched presentation, just\
      \ insulting to the masterpieces that were the pre-rendered backgrounds from\
      \ Still Life, drop the game in the bad category. Stay away from this one. It's\
      \ very annoying to play and hard to look at."
