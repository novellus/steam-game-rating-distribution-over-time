Deathmatches in different scenarios draws me back time after time to hone my skills and to unlock all weapon accessories. Just brainless fun shooting like in paintball or softball wars. Weapon handling feels somewhat quite natural and after a little practise the mag change and  lock-and-load goes fast.\n\nSo the \"practise\" deathmatches are the salt of this game! Then on the contrary I don't know is it me or is the real \"game\" really so short that the game ends in the reactor room. If that is the case then stick to practice chambers.\n\nWell worth the price!","timestamp_created":1565294393,"timestamp_updated":1565294393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46p60uewCeK/+zwE="}
