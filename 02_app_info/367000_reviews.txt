But it's not quite a clone, it's a much improved variant that offers a greater sense of progression, less random failures (that aren't your fault) and numerous other (minor) improvements that total up to a much better game than the one it's cloned from.\n\nIf you already know what Minesweeper is and want a better version of it, this is a no brainer. It's a cheap and pleasant way to kill some time and play with brain teasing puzzles.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Minesweeper, it's a classic game that used to be included with early versions of Windows operating systems to give people a fun way to practice their mouse clicking skills (yes, prior to a mouse being a ubiquitous and common tool, people honestly didn't know how to use the thing well). These days (for whatever reason) it's no longer included by default with Windows 10, but can be found for free through various sources.\n\nSometimes you just want a simple relaxing series of puzzles to chip away the hours.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1609703705,"timestamp_updated":1609703705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqn05PYCfLiWwAI="}
