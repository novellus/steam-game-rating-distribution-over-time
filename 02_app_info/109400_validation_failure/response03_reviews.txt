The gameplay is unique, fast, smooth, complex and interesting. However, as time has passed, the game went downhill pretty quick and never catched up to anyone's expectations again.\n\nLet me start this review by talking about my experience I had with this game:\nI started playing back in 2011 and never really stopped until late 2016. I am currently level 85 (I will probably stay forever at this level) and I have over 94 days of playtime. I used the Steam version just to buy the ingame currency RT (Rock Rockens) because it is here way cheaper compared to the official website. This is why I only have some hours of gameplay on Steam. I even was a Moderator for 2 full years (2014 - 2016) so I kinda know what I am talking about.\n\nThe gameplay itself is neat as I have already said above. Fast, unique and cool.\n\nThe graphics ingame may look great at the beginning but you will notice that, if you play on the highest settings, the maps, especially the \"newer\" ones, are more poorly designed. The actual maps are alright, but some of them are just stupid. For example, why would you and your opponent spawn right next to each other?\n\nThis game has, of course, an ingame currency which costs money (like many other F2P games have). But, oh my god. This  P2W system has gone bonkers. There are, for example, these so called \"God-Weapons\" which cost about 100-200â‚¬/$ each and they are truly \"God weapons\", because the Bazooka and the Grenade Launcher kills everything with 2 or 3 hits. This is pretty nuts compared to the weapons you can get without spending any money. However, MV has started 1 or 2 years ago to implement new weapons who even beat a GOD weapon in every aspect. Those new weapons are sadly not as hard to get as the god weapons. Because of this, almost every second players has at least one powerful weapon. New players with no experience have no chance.\n\nSome might argue that it's not hard to beat someone with every single god weapon just by using MP weapons (MP = Micro Points, the other ingame currency you can get by just playing the game). BUT: This is only possible if you mastered all the techniques like \"Wave-Stepping\" and \"Swapping\" and if you are actually good with riffles and snipers. These tricks require months of practice which is actually a good thing because it adds competitiveness to the game. However, since most of the players you can find ingame nowadays are already playing for several years, new players don't stand a chance against them.\n\nSo far so good. Let's start with the ACTUAL bad part:\n\nThere are, although this game is around for years, still unfixed bugs and glitches who first appeared 2012!!! The game has also not received an Update since December of 2015 to this day which resulted in a huge loss of players. To make matters worse, the EU server has been unreachable for almost 1 month already and there's no sign of EU getting up soon. This had led to incredible lag spikes in the NA server because everyone is now playing there.\nThe game itself is also poorly optimized. From RAM and software errors to black maps is everything covered.\n\nMicroVolts used X-Trap as anti-cheat client for years. However, back in 2015 I believe, MV switched to another anti-cheat client called XIGNCODE. Here's the problem: XIGNCODE hasn't been updated since it was implemented. Now guess what happened... The game has ever been flooded with hackers and cheaters. Great.\n\nThis is by far not everything I have to say but I just don't want to make this review any longer. \n\nTo sum it up:\nMicroVolts had the potential to be a great and successful game with cool gameplay but the developer's greed and desinterest made MicroVolts to what it has become. \nIt's truly sad...","timestamp_created":1487798101,"timestamp_updated":1488565822,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.784538686275482178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo/zbytoCfefscg=="}
