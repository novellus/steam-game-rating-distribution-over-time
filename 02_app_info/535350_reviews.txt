The combat is just 'walk up to enemy, click the mouse.' But you can't avoid the combat, because enemies can arbitrarily teleport into melee range if you try to run past them. The puzzles that I've seen up until the point in the game I played are mostly either glaringly obvious or pointlessly cryptic. It's also kind of glitchy.\n\nBut the thing above all others that really made me not like this game is the fact that it's just, /absurdly/ slow-paced. I was willing to give it a chance, until I got the shovel from the farmer, at which point he told me to dig up his crops. Each crop I had to dig up locked the character in place for several seconds while a sound-effect played. And with how on the edge I was about the game up until that point, that was the tipping point, at which point I realized that the game has no gameplay flow to speak of. I realize some of this is because it's built in RPG-Maker, but really, you can only blame the engine so much before you ask why the devs didn't just use a different engine.","timestamp_created":1609103331,"timestamp_updated":1609103331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ464mC0/YCednwvQI="}
