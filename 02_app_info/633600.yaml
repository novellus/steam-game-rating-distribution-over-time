    short_description: Living on the moon is lonely, and stressful, and exhausting.
      Video games have always offered you an escape to a better life. The easy, happy
      life you wish you had. Which makes it so frustrating when the game you've been
      playing ends badly.

    review: One of the few choice based stories that really has you thinking afterwards,
      which is refreshing. It isnt too long and is just as long as it needs to be.
      Very easy to get into and read, though the first few pages may be a bit confusing
      but its part of the theme. The forced diversity took me a little out of it but
      it you can look past that I def recommend it. I just wish the damn ending was
      different. (jokes)
