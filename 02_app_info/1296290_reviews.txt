The incident left family and friends lost for words as everything seemed fine with the victim. And to think I only got knee deep in research because [i]curator connect[/i] offered it to me- otherwise I wouldn't even realize I already possessed it from a previous sale XD. Granted, themes dealing with mental health are more widespread in video games. Though they tend to revolve around fictional premises (up for debate) such as in [b]Town of Light, The Missing or Detention[/b].\n\nUsually handled with respect and educate us on lesser known intricacies of mental disorders but others exploit or phone it in by slapping them with \"psychological horror.\" [b]What Happened (WH)[/b] is smack dab in the middle of that spectrum. It began with great intentions except it didn't stick the landing after all the huffin' and puffin', believe me it's a lot~\n\n[h1]\"Enjoy It- While It Lasts...\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nStiles is your everyday angst-filled and depressed teen trying to survive going through the motions in high school. For the past year however, things have been escalating and on one fateful day- he spirals. A dear old companion, cheerleader and devil's advocate emerges and together they go on a trip of deja vu.\n\n[spoiler] ! Be mindful of your actions! [/spoiler]\n\n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) Your Mind on Drugs![/b]\nNot much in way of gameplay and so it's fair to call it a [/i]drug simulation[/i]. Your alter ego being your guide on what to do, judging you and taunting you- the bumbling introvert. There are venting journal entries to be found too, shedding light on his struggles. Pretty soon, he descends into incoherence and tasked with locating light bulbs while getting lost in the maze that is the drug-addled mind.\n\nThere aren't a lot of ways to die but when you do, you enter multiple versions of \"Limbo\" and you have to seek the way out. Ultimately, the endings are the incentives to continue playing and they can actually be achieved in one go, provided you inspect carefully! Fortunately for me, I managed to uncover the alternate \"bad endings\" and then I simply 'continued' from the main menu.\n\n[b](b) Take It All In[/b]\nNow, the sheer amount of time, hard work that went in to the design of the school is obvious. Be it the variety of posters plastered throughout or props that cater to different classrooms! All wonderfully detailed and I must've spent the first hour admiring them. It's a living, breathing school so kudos!! The creative input is just nothing short of endless, creating almost unique set pieces to throw at you that you can't help but stop and stare. Since Stiles' school acts as his anchor, it only makes sense to revisit it a lot and it's spruced up each time to convey a different state of mind. \n\nAnother gorgeous illustration of its visuals go into the [b]Layers of Fear[/b] manipulation of \"reality\" where once you reach a dead end, you turn around and something's changed! This is done a lot and I couldn't keep up. It's sure to leave you satisfied!! The mirrored effects of drugs kicking in start off slow and psychedelic-like but amp up in intensity. So just take a break every now and then~\n\n[b](c) Don't Feel- Just. Do. It.[/b]\nIn keeping with the theme of the game, I'll let you find out WH for yourself! Instead, I'll go into what I liked a.k.a. what I found scary~ Firstly, the idea of a darker version of yourself is very much a nightmare. It knows everything about you, it ridicules, second guesses and clouds your thoughts. Technically it's still you in control but we all have our fair share of the bad, don't we?\n\nSecondly, I have to point out a character that I just loved; whose performance was natural and sweet. It's Rose! I absolutely fell head over heels because of what she and the flower represents. You'll see single roses throughout the ugly tripping and it's somehow reassuring. The phrase 'every rose has its thorn' couldn't be more true because like[spoiler]Stiles, or rather you[/spoiler] just don't appreciate what you do have. \n\nThirdly, I liked how it was on the nose about the people's tendency to overreact and replay that same moment of regret. It's tough to see someone going through it but what about those who keep it hidden? Makes you wonder... Finally the title, \"WH\" depending on the intonation or punctuation can imply many nuances. Is it out curiosity, a blaming tone or just explanatory?\n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) A Bad Trip[/b] \nDisorienting is an understatement for that initial gimmick of colors grows into unbearable and nausea-inducing the further you go. It's like they wanted to see how many filters and novel ways to rotate the camera could be fit in until people hurl. Then the angle suddenly zooms and jerks all shaky cam to direct your attention. Oh and head bob can't be toggled off so rest up every hour.\n\n[b](ii) Out of Stile[/b]\nStiles is the protagonist but he's...bland and reserved. I liked the \"Mind\" / alter ego but he's just dying to be edgy and dark, comes off as a try hard. Other characters were standard teenage drama fodder, who we don't learn enough of to actually see them favorably... Also, the depiction of self-harm got so gratuitous. I'd rather not be shown any and just told (on second thought, talked my ears off too). Moderation, that was missing!!\n\n[b](iii) [i]'High[/i]' School!? Dude...[/b]\nAlter Stiles is like a preacher- that is if they were the ones telling you to give in to [spoiler]the dark urges[/spoiler]. What we are treated to, is preachy, beating that dead horse over. Kid you not, by the end- I questioned what was the point of everything?! The game was better off cutting its price and runtime by half, which I think would have conveyed its message just as fine.\n\n[b](iv) Good Luck Unseeing That[/b]\nSome nitpicks are the notes which are somehow randomly generated? Because every time I locate one, I make a habit to leave that drawer open. But next time I came back, it was moved to a different drawer!? Plus, an achievement bug, where it said I \"collected all notes\" but then being the rebel I am- I found more!\n\nThe amount of phasing objects were off-putting. A note standing on its own protruding out the cabinet or grass and other foliage coming through drawers. The game may question reality but that's just sloppy. Even some objects are placed too close to another and when you open the drawer, it goes into the other object. Little things like these can be damning!\n\n\n[h1]\"More Like, What COULD'VE Happened....\"[/h1]\n\nPrognosis? WH came from a wholesome, noble place by not victimizing those who have considered suicide. Bringing that vision to life proves arduous- ending up mundane, overstretched for the most part though it has its moments of clarity. I am an immense advocate for mental health so I can appreciate the sentiment and was really hoping it'd be something special (which it is, just not all the way). What it did exceptionally is in its breathtaking visuals of a life-like school setting and unpredictability of Stiles' being under the influence. \n\nHowever, such a momentous stride to mental health awareness calls for impeccable execution and a certain degree of sensitivity that was just not present. And with a dull and one-dimensional cast, it's challenging to like let alone care for them... The same goes for the at first alluring transitions that became obnoxious and induced in me enough motion sickness for my lifetime. Though I \"don't recommend it\", I'd advise picking it up when its price is slashed as it's still fairly enjoyable and an innovative piece of entertainment- I guess that's why it hurt even more~\n\n[h1]5.8/10[/h1]\n\n[b]WH churned my stomach for all the wrong reasons, but I can't wait for what follows![/b]","timestamp_created":1609032233,"timestamp_updated":1609590512,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.687248885631561279","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmMPE4fYCft3KvQI="}
