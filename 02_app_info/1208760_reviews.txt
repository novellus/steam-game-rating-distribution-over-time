I enjoyed the game and recommend you get it (it's not exactly all that expensive anyway), but I like complaining so I'll leave it as is.\n\nView From Below is Undertale with an edgy religious coat of paint. The game has enough humour and self-awareness to pull the edgy bit off, but that's not what disappointed me. What disappointed me is that the game is quite compelling when it's not just being Undertale, but when it is Undertale, it's so egregiously Undertale that it borders on plagiarism. Both Undyne chases are in this game [i]verbatim[/i], but five times as long, for example. There were so many instances where I thought \"this is literally just an asset/sound/story beat/character/game mechanic/level/dialogue from Undertale, but done worse\" that I got genuinely upset, especially since [i]the game is GOOD when it's not just aping Undertale![/i]\n\nThat aside, VFB is a solid Undertale \"\"\"\"inspired\"\"\"\" RPG which I had a good time with. The plot is pretty engaging despite being unintentionally goofy at times, somehow simultaneously more and less anime than Undertale's despite their obvious parallels. The combat and puzzles are good, though I find the combat is more tedious than it is challenging a lot of the time in the last half of the game. \n\nDespite all those nitpicks, I like the game and hope the dev makes similar (but please more original) works in the future.","timestamp_created":1607286412,"timestamp_updated":1607286412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495495498180389404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607935135,"developer_response":"Hey -\n\nI love this genre a lot, so I think you can see little bits of inspirations from lots of turn-based games (like Undertale, Pokemon and Earthbound, etc.), but I did try to make mine stand a bit on it’s own.\n\nTo help with this, I just released a big update (6.0) that changes up some bits and pieces that I think I didn’t differentiate enough from other games I was inspired by. I went through and remade a couple of sprites and tilesets, Rose’s chase sequences (the 3rd is still quite similar gameplay-wise to Undyne’s 2nd chase, but I did add additional obstacles to dodge (it's *extremely* hard in challenge mode now lol)) and two Pokemon-y puzzles to make the game feel more unique.\n\nI also fixed up the issue of being overpowered toward the end of the game by reducing stat gains upon leveling up to level 8, 9 and 10, and also increased the final boss’ attack stat.\n\nThanks so much for the detailed feedback, it really helped! (Also, I’ll absolutely make more games in the future!)"}],"cursor":"AoJwrorvnPYCeIrrtwI="}
