    review: 'I really wanted to enjoy this addon - I bought all four packs. I am learning
      to fly microlights and our club sometime fly out to some of these field strips.
      Unfortunately there are several issues that I can''t overlook. Firstly, adding
      just one pack hugely increases the loading time. Adding all four increased the
      loading time before a flight to around five minutes. The workaround is to go
      into the ''Scenery'' setting and temporarily disable the packs that are not
      relevant to your flight.


      More significantly, once FSX has finally loaded your flight, instead of being
      on the ''Active Runway'' as per the settings, I am actually parked in some random
      spot. One airfield puts me in the middle of a tree, and another immediately
      in front of a caravan. In many cases the aircraft instantly crashes because
      it''s parked in a piece of terrain. You can get around it by disabling crash
      detection, but you shouldn''t have to do that.


      I am using the packs in conjunction with UK2000 VFR Airfields, which is superb
      by the way, and doesn''t cause massive loading times. Farm Strips duplicates
      some of the UK2000 airfields and doesn''t have a facility to disable the duplicate.


      If it worked, this would be a fantastic addon. Unfortunately the loading times
      and incorrect aircraft placement mean this is not a recommended purchase.
