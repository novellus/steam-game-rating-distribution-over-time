Faint echoes of mid-to-late era Dillinger Escape Plan instrumentals don't exactly harm my opinion, either.\n\n   What can I say: good fricking music is good fricking music. And sure, it's a bit short, but all the better to listen to on repeat, my dear. Highly recommended to almost anyone, even at the full price of two buckaroonies. (Or, er...[i]twelve[/i] buckaroonies, should you need to buy the game to go with it. I think I got it in a bundle, which would probably explain why I haven't gotten around to PLAYING said game yet!)\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1530294389,"timestamp_updated":1604459145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589125394821166992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48vTNyPUCf4zUpAE="}
