It's no joke that kinetic visual novel [i]Breeding Village[/i] is every man's dream:  The main character is fed up with big city life being a small cog in a giant machine, and quits his job to move to the countryside to take a new job.  The occupation?  Getting women pregnant via loveless, assembly line sex in a village where all the men have been rendered sexually dysfunctional.  The men are perfectly fine with the main character going to work on their wives and the women are perfectly comfortable having sex in public places with the main character sometimes having as many as three simultaneous sexual partners.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nWhen Megumi was first encountered, ol' Il Pallino's Kawaii-O-Meter exploded in a ball of rainbow glitter when set to the age range specific to [i]Breeding Village[/i]. (Late 20's to early 40's.) [i]Cherry Kiss Games[/i] owes ol' Il Pallino a new Kawaii-O-Meter!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1721068015\n\nUnlike other visual novels, [i]Breeding Village[/i] has a limited amount of movement in the form of Megumi's eyes blinking.  None of the other women blink their eyes, which infers that Cherry Kiss' fans will spend most of their time looking at Megumi.\n\nThe music does nothing for the game, but that's obvious:  Who wants to hear music playing in adult entertainment?  This is especially true of [i]Breeding Village[/i] which is fully voice acted, and nobody wants to hear any sort of tune playing while a woman is talking dirty or moaning really loud.\n\n[h1]Positives and Negatives[/h1]\n\nUnlike most visual novels on the market, [i]Breeding Village[/i] allows the player to set the name of the main character to better add to their fantasy of going to a small town and doing more \"nailing\" than a carpenter on speed.\n\n[i]Breeding Village[/i] is a distinctly Japanese game which is good and bad.  Anyone who's ever seen any sort of Japanese adult entertainment (be it hentai anime or something with live actresses) knows that Japanese women have the sweetest voices and most pleasing moans.  The downside is that stupid law requiring even animated characters to have their genitals blurred out.  (There is, however, an interior view of sexual intercourse with all of the women which is probably pretty hot for people who either have an impregnation fetish or are turned on by the biological aspect of sexual intercourse.)\n\n[i]Breeding Village[/i] is a kinetic visual novel, which for those unfortunate souls who don't understand anime lingo, means that the game doesn't have any choices available to the player. However, the game is made longer by the fact that the sex scenes are so intense, that any player who actually does make it a point of reading will really need to take a break after reading (and watching) a sexual encounter.\n\nIf the reader noticed this review on the store page, then the reader knows [i]Breeding Village[/i] was published by [i]Cherry Kiss Games[/i], which means that there's going to be some very chesty female characters to enjoy.  While the ages and degrees of skin pigments are varied, the bodies all have the same shape, and that includes the tomboy (like in most anime) that has breasts as big as every other woman and arms and legs as skinny as every other woman.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThe chest of a female character from a [i]Cherry Kiss Games[/i] visual novel is like professional wrestling: They're both obviously fake, but that doesn't disappoint the fans.\n\n[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino...
