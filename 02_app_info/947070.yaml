    review: "In \"Dashing Dinsaurs & Sexy Centaurs\" you\xB4re put in the role to\
      \ be the director of a play \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nYour job is to tell actors\
      \ (that are added / hired during the progression of the game) how to perform\
      \ on stage. This training takes you 5 weeks and after 5 weeks you perform your\
      \ play in front of an audience... afterwards criticians will review your play.\n\
      \nThere are many choices how to design the play and so this game has a high\
      \ replay value. Also these decisions are bound to archeivements so if you\xB4\
      re into archeivements you can get some archeivements here by re playing the\
      \ game.\n\nAside from being a director there is some background story happening.\
      \ There are two families not really happy about each other (to speak friendly\
      \ about the situation). It is intended to make such an incredible good performance\
      \ in your play - the play is shown to members of these families - that they\
      \ settle down whatever they do not like about each other.\n\nFamily members\
      \ will talk to the protagonist to play... and other things happen in the background\
      \ as it is said in the short store-page description.\n\nFor some reason the\
      \ decision has been made to make this game Furry... Scalie and other Creatures\
      \ so I\xB4m now going to review this part.\n\nI\xB4ve had played the game from\
      \ beginning to finish 3 times now and doing so I\xB4ve dated different characters\
      \ and made different decisions. There are various creatures from the Furry /\
      \ Scalie and even Mythological universe that you will meet during a play through.\n\
      \nAs I\xB4ve previously written you can date these creatures, the game even\
      \ gives you a tutorial after some progression and it tells you that ... and\
      \ how you can date others you might be interested in. With this information\
      \ I\xB4ve dated a few creatures and I found out that there seem to be two dates\
      \ during the game. The dates happen between the breaks from the rehersal / training\
      \ for the play.\n\nThe dates I have had were in a restaurant, being kinda short\
      \ since the dialouge that was there to read was read in less than one minute.\
      \ It usually goes like this: You eat and drink together and do some chit-chat...\
      \ ... the so-called chit-chat is not really described or it\xB4s very short\
      \ just giving some random background information about the character you are\
      \ dating. Also the date is not interactive so you just sit there and click through\
      \ text without the possibility to ask out your date or make suggestions.\n\n\
      I have not dated all of the characters  that you can date but a few, and the\
      \ one\xB4s I\xB4ve dated were rather silent about themself like they give you\
      \ a few lines of their background story like \"I did this in the past\" or \"\
      I\xB4m here because...\" ... I think it was something like that but over all\
      \ the date is over in less than one minute, depending on your reading speed.\
      \ That\xB4s for the first date.\n\nThe second date happens very late... I think\
      \ it was before the final play. Aggain you go to the restaurant and talk to\
      \ each other (Text that is read in 30 seconds) then... I\xB4ve always have it\
      \ happen that one of the characters comes in and tells you that \"something\
      \ has happened, you need to come\" - ending the 2nd date.\n\nOther than that\
      \ I\xB4ve not had any more dating yet. My character neither did kiss his / her\
      \ (You can play as male or female) Date... nor I\xB4ve had more dates like a\
      \ 3rd date. Maybe the dates for the other characters are different, but the\
      \ one\xB4s I\xB4ve had could be sumarized like this: Meet your date in a restaurant,\
      \ and share a few words...\n\n\nThe characters themself as creatures seem to\
      \ play a double role. Yes, they are here on screen and occasionly they even\
      \ show emotions (face and body expressions change) but over all they feel like\
      \ that they\xB4ve just been put there... to... be there. They show emotions,\
      \  but over all their bodies are quite \"stiff\" and if they would be replaced\
      \ with a stick figure during the game you wouldn\xB4t even notice it ... probably...\
      \ as you\xB4re busy telling one of the actors how to act in a specific situation.\
      \ There are hints in the game about the characters as it is stated for example:\
      \ \"A horseman is a heavy person\" or \"The Dragon\xB4s Scales are really hard\"\
      \  but apart from that\nthe characters there seem to be just here... like they\
      \ are saying \"ignore what I am... what species I am or how I look - we are\
      \ here to perform a play... I as creature do not matter\". I think I\xB4ve\n\
      also read that a character says something about him or her being human ( I don\xB4\
      t recall it exactly) that was either a joke or um... it was a reference to the\
      \ original play being written by a human? I don\xB4t know but it was an odd\
      \ read. \n\nFrom the technical side the game is quite solid. As it\xB4s a new\
      \ game and new games occasionly contain bugs, this game is quite clear. Playing\
      \ through it I\xB4ve only had one ren-py error... and only read like 3-4 typos\
      \ so far (the typos are like \"Wy\" instead of \"Why\" but you get what is meant\
      \ to be said even of this) ... apart from that nothing bad has happened with\
      \ the game.\n\n\nThere are sounds... at least there is an volume adjustment\
      \ for them in the menu, still ... having sound level all the way up all I could\
      \ hear sound-wise during my play sessions was a sound when my status with someone\
      \ had improoved. No open-door ... telephone ring... or other typical sounds\
      \ were noticeable when I played the game.\n\nMusic is different. Altough there\xB4\
      s the typical visual novel music you\xB4d expect in such a game it\xB4s mixed\
      \ with suprisingly fresh vocal / guitar music. The songs are used various time\
      \ during the game and the music also tells you about the over all emotion.\n\
      \nThere are lot of choices to be made, and as the choices you make for designing\
      \ the play change the play in a strong way... choices outside the play seem\
      \ to not matter that much. What I want to say is that I\xB4ve had it that often\
      \ what I did say to a character did not matter at all because it neither gave\
      \ me stat points... nor changed what followed... so for example if the character\
      \ says \"This is good\" ... it doesn\xB4t matter if I said the 1st... 2nd...\
      \ 3rd... or 4th choice before to a situation, he or she will say \"this is good\"\
      \ - making the fact to have 4 choice options kinda pointless... You won\xB4\
      t notice this on your first play through but you will notice it on your 2nd\
      \ or 3rd. Also the sentence I wrote was just an example but I remember when\
      \ you had a dance and you could pick different people, and it didn\xB4t matter\
      \ who I pick, I ended up with the same situations.\n\nA single play through\
      \ takes between 90 and 120 minutes depending on your reading speed.\n\nSo...\
      \ what is it now with this game? Buy or not? Well as I\xB4ve reviewed it positive...\
      \ since I\xB4m reviewing the create a play part of the game I\xB4d say it depends\
      \ on what you expect. If you are into Romeo and Juliet and a game that likes\
      \ humor and has some jokes in it I\xB4m sure you will spend a good time in this\
      \ game. If you are into these creatures I would say it depends on what you want.\
      \ Hanging around with them ... just to see a picture of let\xB4s say an antrophomorph\
      \ Owl... it sure is good for you. If you\xB4re known to other creature related\
      \ games where the creatures themself are more in the focus you might have a\
      \ second thought about this specific game."
