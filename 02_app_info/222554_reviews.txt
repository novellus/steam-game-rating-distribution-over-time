This add-on is so enchanting I thought I would share why I think it's such a good route to drive. \n\nThe scenery - I am currently driving in winter mode on a clear afternoon - is magical. I find myself looking around in wonder and finding my train's speed has crept above what it should be.  The stations are little miracles of detail, from benches to posters to warning signs, waiting rooms and luggage trolleys, all add to an authentic 1960's feel.\n\nI am not one for playing scenarios, much prefer to go my own way using Quick Drive (QD). Unfortunately on some routes QD is a lonely place, no AI traffic at all. This route, like Riviera Line in the Fifties is a joy. The yards are full of trucks and milk tanks and chemical tanks awaiting their fate, the line is busy with passenger trains and goods trains - a real pleasure to travel along and adding that touch of realism that makes me so happy. A lot of work has gone into making this route and I congratulate the people who created it.\n\nI am at the moment making my way from Carlisle to Stranraer Harbour. Up to Dumfries the line still exists in modern times. From Dumfries we take the left hand branch and step back in time to a line that's been lost for over 50 years. From Castle Douglas the line single running. There are many up and downs requiring a lot of concentration on your speed limit. I have reached Newton Stewart and stopped for a rest. Will continue to Stranraer tomorrow.\n\nA nice long route, plenty to see, lots of traffic, and  relaxing to drive. Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1608829215,"timestamp_updated":1608829215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kbTsyvYCeKLpvAI="}
