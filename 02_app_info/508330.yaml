    review: "Having played hundreds of classic JRPGs, I'm always on the lookout for\
      \ a fresh experience. Zombies are still a rare appearance in classic JRPGs.\
      \ \"Wolfenhain\", a free German RPG, implemented them in a Low Fantasy setting\
      \ last year. \"Galer: Plague of Heroes\" is this year's High Fantasy JRPG embodiment.\n\
      \nIf you like Final Fantasy VI (large cast of characters, dawning apocalypse\
      \ scenario) and zombies, bothered to read my review and don't dislike RPG Maker\
      \ (2003) games, there's a good chance this game might appeal to you.\n\nWhile\
      \ the story (see the game description) is executed fairly well (despite/because\
      \ of a lack of major, but therefore also often unbelievable plot twists), it\
      \ suffers from typos and a \"doughy\", seemingly unrelated beginning. If you\
      \ can make it past that, though, you'll have a hard time finding another JRPG\
      \ like Galer that forces you this strongly to question your heroes' success.\
      \ Despair's palpable as you seem to fight a losing battle. This might be the\
      \ game's greatest merit, as the heroes' victory in other JRPGs is never in any\
      \ real danger (unless these games deliberately offer \"bad ending\" or \"chaos\"\
      \ routes). Finally, a satisfying ending rounds out the story.\n\nThe beginning\
      \ is typical JRPG fare (visit town, clear dungeon, rinse and repeat). Things\
      \ get more interesting when the player is granted full control over his own\
      \ home base. Here, he can change party members, forge equipment, create items\
      \ and much more. A lot of systems and mechanics have been implemented compared\
      \ to other JRPGs of this kind. While this is commendable, the player can find\
      \ enough rare equipment in dungeons without ever having to rely on the opportunities\
      \ the home base has to offer.\n\nSpeaking of implemented mechanics, there's\
      \ a rather unique one: When traversing the world map, the player doesn't only\
      \ fight random encounters on the world map, but also random encounters to protect\
      \ the home base (either-or, so this doesn't mean twice as much random encounters).\
      \ This feature creates the chance to test all characters in battle and contributes\
      \ to the story scenario's flair. Furthermore, if the home base party is strong\
      \ enough to scare monsters away (happens automatically), the player receives\
      \ a \"Wild Card\" that awards, when used, a randomly created bonus. The effects\
      \ range from mere money to (permanent) status-raising items, free level-ups,\
      \ summons that can be used in battle and even new skills. I deem this mechanic\
      \ refreshing, but easily abusable once the party members are strong enough.\
      \ In any case, be prepared for a rather high random encounter rate with no way\
      \ of mitigating it. Apocalypse isn't known to let the players rest.\n\nWhen\
      \ the home base becomes available, the player has to choose a difficulty setting.\
      \ \"Normal\" leaves everything as it is, but \"difficult\" forces the player\
      \ to buy food rations in order to survive overworld trips. Despite underlining\
      \ the fight for survival, this feature complicates exploring the world map,\
      \ so I'm glad it's purely optional. It may very well be this feature doesn't\
      \ pose a problem anymore once the player is able to travel by (air)ship.\n\n\
      My biggest gripe with the large cast of characters is that there aren't enough\
      \ meaningful battles for all of them to participate in. There are some scenarios\
      \ that force the player to use certain party members, but it just isn't enough\
      \ (so don't expect a \"Suikoden\"). Especially the game's final stage, despite\
      \ being intense as hell, wastes a lot of potential in this regard (compare JRPGs\
      \ like \"Legends of Illarion\" that force the player to use all party members\
      \ by forming different parties for simultaneously - successively - fought battles).\
      \ It doesn't help that many characters receive hardly any development (if any\
      \ at all). The antagonists aren't anything special, but they get their jobs\
      \ done. On the other hand, the main characters and their problems are likable\
      \ and believable. To name a few: Paladins struggling with the fact that the\
      \ god they believed in may not exist, regular people having to cope with the\
      \ loss of their friends, a defector having a hard time to be (and feel) accepted\
      \ - while the wheel isn't reinvented, any JRPG player will feel right at home.\n\
      \nDependent on which party members the player takes (and sometimes doesn't take!)\
      \ with him to certain locations, he's awarded with additional story scenes or\
      \ side quests that become available. The player can discover enough hints to\
      \ find most of the optional stuff, but he's likely to miss something without\
      \ developer's knowledge. Most of the side quests unlock scenes from the past\
      \ of certain characters, which the player can view at the home base. There are\
      \ also some \"one-time only dungeons\" and other permanently missable things.\
      \ Thus, be aware that this game can be frustrating for completionists, particularly\
      \ as it doesn't offer any replay value.\n\nAnother typical problem that comes\
      \ with (too) many party members: The player doesn't know which characters will\
      \ be useful until the end. Should you level up your characters evenly or concentrate\
      \ on a few select ones? It's definitely the latter for this game. Since there\
      \ are enough (voluntary) opportunities to grind and even to buy level-ups for\
      \ party members (using money earned in-game at the home base, requiring increasing\
      \ amounts of money at higher levels), any player will be able to circumnavigate\
      \ potential \"roadblocks\". The game features some unwinnable boss battles,\
      \ though, a device I truly despise. This is even more aggravating considering\
      \ this game could really use more boss battles in general. Fortunately, at least\
      \ the ones available can be exciting and force the player to make full use of\
      \ all his battle options.\n\nBattles feature the standard RPG Maker 2003 system,\
      \ which means ATB (\"active time battles\") like in earlier Final Fantasy games.\
      \ Bars fill up for your party members, and if a bar is completely full, you\
      \ can input an action. Dependent on the setting, this system either resembles\
      \ real-time combat (\u201Cactive\u201D) or turn-based combat (\u201Cwait\u201D\
      ). The wait function is fully automatic, so battles halt completely when it's\
      \ the player\u2019s turn to input an action. I really appreciate this execution,\
      \ since a lot of JRPGs only halt battles when pressing \u201Center\u201D or\
      \ while navigating through menus.\n\nApart from the battles, there are several\
      \ \"mini games\" that require to avoid or run away from zombies or to quickly\
      \ fetch some things to barricade a house so that zombies can't enter. Some of\
      \ these sequences are difficult, especially when the player isn't accustomed\
      \ to 2D action games, but they are never unfair and instead manage to make the\
      \ zombie apocalypse feel more real (also, there's only a few of them). This\
      \ isn\u2019t \"The Walking Dead\", where zombies don't pose much of a threat\
      \ nowadays. Additionally, there are some sequences during which the player has\
      \ to \"perform\" while being pressed for time (e.g. flee from a collapsing cave\
      \ within five minutes like in \"Wild Arms 1\"). I don't like being pressed for\
      \ time in JRPGs, but these sequences fit the game's style, and they are - once\
      \ again - never unfair.\n\nIn terms of graphics and music/sound, the game seems\
      \ to rely on resources from RPG Maker 2003's RTP, mixed with a few fitting original\
      \ pieces. These graphical resources are, to my mind, the best ones to create\
      \ a Super Nintendo JRPG flair, but as a consequence, this game looks like any\
      \ other game made with RPG Maker 2003. There's room for improvement when it\
      \ comes to mapping, but the overall dungeon design is mostly motivating. The\
      \ developer responds quickly to bug notifications, so the game shouldn't suffer\
      \ from game-breaking bugs anymore.\n\nI enjoyed this game despite the aforementioned\
      \ flaws, and I encourage any JRPG aficionado to at least give it a try. Galer\
      \ isn't a masterpiece, but it's a tremendous (mostly) one-man effort, a love\
      \ letter to classic JRPGs, adding a special zombie touch. Trying like Galer\
      \ to tweak the formula without breaking it, that's what more classic JRPGs nowadays\
      \ should try to accomplish."
