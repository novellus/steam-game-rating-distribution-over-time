This part is a bit more explorative, yet it still feels like an unfinished part of the whole story. It offers some twists and turns, and some unexpected betrayal that give this story a very specific feel. Yes, it is better than the first part, yes, the HOG-Scenes are pretty well done, they are yet on the easy spectrum of the genre. So the whole series is more like a beginner, or starter game. The Riddles and Minigames put in here are pretty simple, and mostly you don't need to skip one of them - since they are pretty well known, most of them at least.\n\nQuestion still is, is it recommendable. Yes, if you own the first part, and hate lose ends like myself, you might want to get it, yet... it still has some lapses in logic, which might give you a headache. I can conditionally recommend this game, for players who like Hidden Object games, that are more on the \"Adventure Light\" side of the spectrum. Try to get it cheap, since 9,99 Bucks is a tad overpriced.","timestamp_created":1577945038,"timestamp_updated":1577945038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy8+2su8CfpCS6QE="}
