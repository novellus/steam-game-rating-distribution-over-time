    about_the_game: "1957, an order was placed for a batch of diesel-electric locomotives\
      \ which were destined for the Southern Region of British Railways. Known at\
      \ the time as the BRCW Type 3s, they were built as Bo-Bo, mixed-traffic locomotives,\
      \ fitted with 1550 horsepower Sulzer engines that could propel them to a top\
      \ speed of 85 mph. They housed Crompton Parkinson electrical equipment, forever\
      \ giving them the nickname \u201CCromptons\u201D. A true classic, the BR Class\
      \ 33 comes to Train Sim World for heritage diesel operation.<br><br>The first\
      \ BRCW Type 3s were rolled off the production line in 1959, entering service\
      \ that December; the initial batch of 65 locomotives was delivered until 1961,\
      \ and then a second batch was completed by 1962, totalling 98 locomotives across\
      \ 3 main variants. <br><br>Once in regular service, the Type 3s quickly became\
