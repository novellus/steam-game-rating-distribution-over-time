    review: 'This is a pretty hesitant recommendation. I grew up playing Unreal Tournament
      (the original), and loved it. For some reason I never got around to playing
      Unreal. So after all these years I thought I''d try it out. Given how brilliant
      the level design and action is in Tournament, I expected this to be a pretty
      compelling single-player. But, I don''t know, it doesn''t feel much of a step
      beyond Quake. There are some pretty vistas for its time, but the combat feels
      stale, and the level design is utterly bizarre.  I''m often running around a
      map looking for a random button, which yeah, I know, is the basis of Doom and
      Quake, but their buttons seem to me a bit more obvious. Unreal has messages
      and some semblance of a world order, and yet the means of level progress feels
      more opaque than the older shooters. I''m only about a third of the way through
      the game, so maybe it will improve, but for now I would say this is just an
      average 90''s shooter if you need another one.


      Also, the control are a bit wonky. For instance, leaping out of water launches
      the avatar, making platforming from water very difficult. Platforming in general
      is difficult to gauge. It''s just not as smooth as the controls of Quake or
      Half-Life.'
