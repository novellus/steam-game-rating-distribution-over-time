    review: 'its an amazing game, content is brand new so not too many spells n stuff
      to play with and not many people are online when i play. But i only played for
      30 min and it is launch day so i don''t expect many people to play right now
      but i have very high hopes and think this game is fantastic so far. for what
      i have seen i didnt find any major glitches and everything was working super
      smoothly on virtual desktop when usually any pc vr game is super laggy, but
      not this one but i am TRASH at the game and keep getting rekt by the bots but
      i do like the bot game feature . keep up the amazing work. '
