So I put a spoiler warning here if you haven't played the main game. It is a pure graphic novel with some extras, so it does not influence the main story in any way.\nFrom what I gathered, it happens after Gijin is revealed, but before he attacks the capital. It likely happens around chapter 8 of 12.\nA special insight are the Mini-Events, especially the one of the Harem Dream of the priest implies that the good ending - the alternate one - seems to be in fact the canon ending, as seen by one of the women from the good ending being part of said harem.\nThe other is the fact that the merchant was in a certain city before, know for its open mentality towards the world prior to the warring states era. He also met his assistant beforehand as she is present there. It is therefore likely, that Saki came from the area of Sakai. I still guess the merchant is either from the Hansa or the Netherlands, since the hair colour is more prominent with the German states and not Great Britain... and surely not Portuguese. The Netherlands were quite involved in Asia at that time. So greetings to the Netherlands!\n\nThe rest of the story you have to find out for yourselves. Sadly the story is neither diverse nor consequential as your only free choice is the first one. All the other are do or die... so don't expect a deep narration.\n\nOverall I only regret having bought it one day before it was halved by 50%. Then again I got the main game in a free bundle during a donation, so I gladly paid the 50% more. For all that enjoy a little novel, feel free to grab it. For those that expect a game with deeper choice mechanics... don't. I liked it.","timestamp_created":1439244428,"timestamp_updated":1439244428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528464972972869873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwruTpjM8CcO3WQg=="}
