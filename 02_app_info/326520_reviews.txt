You can probably tell I think that just from seeing how many hours I've put into it.\n\nThe music is, by and large, beautiful. The gameplay (in Standard) is amazingly intricate and excellently balanced, allowing for multiple viable strategies to climb to the top of the leaderboard. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it, honestly. Some of the modes (like Strike) really aren't for me, but the beauty of this game is that everyone tends to find their niche in it.\n\nSo, give it a try. (One piece of advice, though: turn on color-blind mode. The color schemes can get a little cute; color-blind mode ensures you can see what's going on.)","timestamp_created":1469243222,"timestamp_updated":1606440995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4nWg/YCfYmtXQ=="}
