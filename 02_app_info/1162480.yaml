    review: 'I''m a huge fan of rougelike card games. I think this game is visually
      quite nice, but the UI is so intense and there is so much going on at once I
      couldn''t take it all in.


      The general mechanic is easy to understand with a tutorial on each, but the
      more in-depth mechanics are not well explained or just not at all. It doesn''t
      help that the font is extremely small and there are brackets around some descriptions
      which complicates understanding. What exactly does this perk mean or do? How
      does this factor into how I play? I don''t know. Progression felt like it was
      perhaps going somewhere, but I really don''t know given my short time with the
      game.


      I realise the English translation is localised, and I appreciate it is undergoing
      revisions with updates, but I couldn''t understand why sometimes I''d do more
      damage and other times I wasn''t doing enough (aside from obvious elemental
      weaknesses), despite having the card state it was doing to do a specific amount
      of damage.


      The premise of the game is good, but does need more polish. I think the developers
      do have something good here, but the story is kind of lacking and I found I
      just didn''t care at all about the characters or the story to try another run.
      I was also concerned as there was a huge gap in months between updates. As it
      is EA, I decided not to take a chance and refunded.


      If you''re interested, I''d say wait until the price is cut considerably, because
      even with the Steam Winter Sale, I think it is too expensive. Wait until it
      is under $10 at least.'
