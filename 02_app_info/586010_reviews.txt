[Mostly everything it provides, i would say is \"MEH\", but if Your fave thing is how they don't have much clothes, the card gallery might entice you i guess]\n\n[b]Artbook[/b] The Sketches were pretty \"MEH\", The Digital Card gallery was Decent >.> I would prefer it be a higher MB so if i want to zoom in and see *stuff* i could, as at 100% view (aka natural) You can see the jaggedness/etc, so to zoom out and see a page your at 33%-50%. \n\n[b]Wallpapers:[/b] Their all a big \"MEH\". The Otton one was decently cute i guess. Would be better if they had expanded the background of the characters in the card gallery, and put those in the wallpapers section also.","timestamp_created":1555894806,"timestamp_updated":1555894806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.674675941467285156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw39SjoeoCfJbdvwE="}
