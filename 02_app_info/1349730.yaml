      Australian Football for casual players, Footy Showdown brings enough tactical
      game play to satisfy Aussie Rules purists. Choose how your players zone, play
      on to take advantage of field position as this game is built from the ground
      up to flow like the real game. Footy Showdown also brings innovations that have
      never been seen in any Australian Football video game.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2>Footy
      Showdown will bring fun but realistic game play keeping true to Australian Football.
      Tackle, bump, mark, kick and handball your way to glory. Players will zone the
      field realistically: There will be players out of position, loose players to
      utilise in your attack, team mates will run in support for handball receives.
      Be tactical though, the path to goal isn''t always straight through the corridor,
      take the wrong option and the opposing team could rebound all the way to goal.<h2
      class="bb_tag">GRAPHICS</h2>Footy Showdown has charming pixel art graphics.
      This art style will stand the test of time like many before it though don''t
      let it fool you, this game will employ advance pixel art techniques to bring
      you the best animations possible for the players.<h2 class="bb_tag">INNOVATIONS</h2>The
      game brings some innovations we have never seen in an Australian Football game
      to date. While we are not ready to fully announce what these are, once they
      are fully implemented and ready to show, you guys will be the first to see them
      in a demonstration video.'
