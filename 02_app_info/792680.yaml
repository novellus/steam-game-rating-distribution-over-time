      /><br><br>-Shoot zombies in the face and earn money!<br>-Watch zombies heads
      explode in slow motion!<br>-Split-screen co-op with another player on the same
      PC.<br>-Unlock new weapons and equipment!<br><br>Containment Initiative is a
      simple game about shooting zombies and earning money for doing it. As you earn
      money, you can buy better guns. Some levels allow you to roam around and collect
      supply crates that are traded in for cash, while other levels will have you
      perched up in a high position and allow you to shoot at zombies without worrying
      about them hitting you back. Once you call for extraction, you will need to
      survive for 60 seconds until the helicopter can arrive. If you die, you will
      lose any money earned in the mission!<br><br>Currently, there are six maps to
      play through with each differing in difficulty.<h2 class="bb_tag">Split-Screen
      Co-op Info</h2><br>One player will need to use the keyboard and mouse and the
      other will need to use an Xbox controller.(Other controllers work just fine,
      but need to be recognized and setup in Steam before playing. Check the forum
      for directions on how to do this.)<h2 class="bb_tag">Online PC/VR Cross Play
      Deprecation Info</h2><br>Crossplay has been replaced by Steam''s new Remote
      Play Together feature. The VR player would only need a single copy of Containment
      Initiative and can then stream the game to you(the PC player) in order to play
      the full game together. More info here: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3032537193879549687"

    review: This is a great game, although i wish there was a little more explanation
      on how the game works. I have not encountered any bugs, and it is splitscreen,
      vr, and online. It is overall a great game.
