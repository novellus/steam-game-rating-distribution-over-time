    review: "Lovely puzzle game, and interesting concept\n\nYou could take a quiz\
      \ and you'll be led to one of the 7 deadly sin rooms \nYes, the puzzles may\
      \ be a bit hard.. but i dont understand whats the deal with people saying..\
      \ \"THE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE\"\nTake those with a grain of salt.. I had no\
      \ problems playing this game \n\nI mean yeah this game is pretty short.. if\
      \ you were smart and acing every puzzle they put in the game... \nWere u expecting\
      \ 10 hours on a puzzle game?\n\n\nCons/Disappointments/Nitpicks: \nNone \n\n\
      >Buy at full price?\nNah, buy this game on sale"
