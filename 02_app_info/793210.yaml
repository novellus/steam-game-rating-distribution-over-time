    short_description: Two years later from &quot;The Hospital&quot; facts, you are
      interested in visiting the place where Rachel and Alfredo should have been buried.
      &quot;The Cathedral&quot; is the second chapter of the Allison's Diary horror
      saga. In the sacred cathedral of Sant'Andrea there is something frightening
      waiting to be discovered.

    review: I got all three from the trilogy on sale. First one was OK, had a good
      atmosphere and was kinda scary, to some extent. This one of the three was the
      least scary. I feel in a church/cathedral like at home, so I kinda enjoyed exploring
      the place, especially the catacombs. I was hoping for some ghosts in the library,
      but it was pretty abandoned, even by the ghosts. Get it on a sale.
