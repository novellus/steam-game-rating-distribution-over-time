    review: "[h1] The intro is BAD, the game itself is MEH, the price is equal to\
      \ a lollipop or a bag of cheap crisps [/h1]\n\nThe dialogue in the intro with\
      \ the animations... Sure a story was being told but I can't pay attention to\
      \ something so worthless as the intro... It would be better if you just used\
      \ something like a comicbook explaining the story?\n\nThen we went to that office,\
      \ girl standing to the left, after the talk with Kevin I started to talk with\
      \ the girl and suddenly my character was spinning 360 degrees looking at the\
      \ floor for 1 minute! Shy? Eitherway, made me sick in the stomache!\n\nFinally\
      \ action.. After dying like 10 times, coming to the conclusion that you already\
      \ have weapons! Only had to press 1, 2 or 3 for getting them. Oh well... Maybe\
      \ I should had paid attention to the intro...\n\nCIA logo during loading times,\
      \ cover your ears!!! Ear Bleeds is a common thing when you hear that CIA logo...\n\
      \nAfter all those grenades, I want to throw some too!!! Where do they hide all\
      \ of those balls??\n\nThe thing I liked, was that when your bullet hits the\
      \ enemy, you see it on your crosshair. And when you down your enemy, feels quite\
      \ satisfying. Especially after being bombarded by grenades all the time. \n\
      And I don't really like it when the character is moving, that it is making such\
      \ tiny steps, as if he wants to keep that B-U-T-T-P-L-U-G inside of him... \n\
      \n[h1] Sometimes I felt like I was that little girl running through the fields\
      \ from \"little house on the prairie\" at certain moments in the game with that\
      \ musical score... -_- [/h1]\n\nBut I won't recommend this game to any of my\
      \ friends... Unless you are a collector of first person shooters, bad or good,\
      \ then grab this game. \n\nFor what it is worth, I will be playing more of this\
      \ game, because I want to know what is happening at the end of the story..."
