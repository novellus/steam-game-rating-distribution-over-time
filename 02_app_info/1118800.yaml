    about_the_game: Future world experiences a parasite-like alien invasion, but enough
      survive to carry on. Although the rules have changed, as most people perspective
      on life and death was heavily impacted by the fear of new-found threat. You're
      just a regular freelance captain living in this post-invasion world, who gets
      recruited for what looks like another regular escort mission. You prepare to
      guide your newly appointed crew through all the dangers, as the path seem to
      lead through territories where parasite activity is still being surveyed, but
      little do you know about the true intentions of this adventure you, and the
      whole crew, got themselves into...<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> A story to experience where player gets to make multiple
      decisions (unheard of);<br></li><li> Your choices matter - over 20 different
      endings to achieve (hopefully all achievable);<br></li><li> Reaction based combat
      where you have to be fast with your buttons (difficulty tested with robots who
      definitely weren't auto hitting everything);<br></li><li> Including some strategy
      and ship management that could have a big impact on your battles (it's not like
      I did bad job while balancing items or anything... b-baka...);<br></li><li>
      And most importantly - no puns! (I think... half the dialogs were written at
      4am)</li></ul>
