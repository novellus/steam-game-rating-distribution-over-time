After (what I consider to be) the utterly dreadful and drab second LC episode, things are mostly back on track with this one.\n\nIt's not clever or original like the 1st one, and has almost none of that episode's quirky charm. But it's a solid HOG, with vastly improved graphics over both the earlier episodes, no problems running in HD, and decent (if unoriginal) puzzles. Also, I didn't turn the music off; so it obviously wasn't completely irritating like some HOGs seem to get away with.\n\nSome 'flaws' in the HO puzzles, though. [spoiler]A shuttlecock is labled as a 'birdie'. A 'snowdrop' turned out to be a sunflower. And using 'helm' to refer to a ships wheel was a bit obscure.[/spoiler] Now; these may just be terms I'm not familiar with, or maybe just odd translations. Completely threw me, anyhow. And when there are quite obviously two books in a scene and only one counts.. irritating. (There are other examples, but I can't remember them now.)\n\nDecent bonus chapter, too.\n\nRecommended if you enjoy HOGs; this fits right in with most of them. Not recommended if you are looking for anything original, challenging or particularly engaging. \n\nI short; a fairly good, standard HOG which, if you like that kind of thing is worth a look. \n","timestamp_created":1540387219,"timestamp_updated":1540387219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531557142734527588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44/SO0+YCfIShrQE="}
