I guess this is done then.\n\n3/20/16: So...this is VERY MUCH early access. No doubt about that. What is here is very rough and I would say at least a year of updates will be needed to make it playable for the majority of Steam users. The menus don't make much sense. The content is at a bare minimum. AI is brutish and easily tricked. That said, it feels like the old Twisted Metal games. There is a lot of potential here. For .99 you get what you pay for at this point, but I have high hopes for this one. Also, \"Missle Uzi\" is the best name for a weapon ever.","timestamp_created":1458603129,"timestamp_updated":1494373238,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50412595272064209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwz8Dl99sCeIzpUw=="}
