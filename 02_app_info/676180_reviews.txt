I started the game with a twin stick controller in my hand but the right stick doesn't work for aiming so I switched to my Sony Move Navigation Controller for moving in combination with my mouse for aiming, I love it when a game supports that. You can use wasd or the arrow keys as well. I mapped some of the shortcuts I found for the power ups and items to my mouse: LAlt, 1 and 2.\n\nI personally don't care much for games with a shop for buying weapon, ship upgrades and items. It's fun getting upgrades and new weapons etc. but earlier levels become easier and easier when you progress in the game. For new levels that are too hard you just stock up on health items and e.g. bombs to get through. It becomes a bit silly. A good shmup requires you to practise and get better to progress. At some point most of the new levels were too easy because of the upgrades.\n\nI find it a bit annoying clicking supershot freezes the game allowing you to select where to deploy the supershot. It should just deploy with a press of the button at the location of your mouse pointer.\n\nThe mouse pointer is a bit small, I wish I could switch to a big reticle or crosshair.\n\nIn conclusion the game is cheap enough to be worth every penny despite its flaws. It took me 9 hours to finish the game completely. Unfortunately once you've finished the game it has zero replay value.","timestamp_created":1542918254,"timestamp_updated":1577658405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iJrxqe8CcruWsQE="}
