Since it's all randomly generated, it's impossible for anyone to create a hint guide-- with other hard puzzle games, like Stephen's Sausage Roll or Baba Is You or Snakebird, I usually google the level number and peek at someone else's solution if a level has me completely stumped, but that's just completely impossible here. (I know that some people consider walkthroughs cheating, and that's fair, but when I'm playing hard puzzles I tend to get fixated on an incorrect solution for hours and looking up a hint is the only way out). This is especially frustrating considering the fact that, unlike those games, this game only has ONE critical path through the world, no alternate routes, so I'll end up bottlenecked on a puzzle, which makes me pray to god for a walkthrough, whereas in the games where walkthroughs ARE available the maps are non-linear so I can put off the hard levels\n\nIf steam had a sideways thumb option, I would give it to this game, but I've played it too much to give it the thumbs down in good faith","timestamp_created":1603936403,"timestamp_updated":1603936403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44+eDufUCevrgqgI="}
