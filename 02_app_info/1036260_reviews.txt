I'd recommend this to people who enjoy story based games. It does have puzzles, but they're quite simple.\n\nPros:\n- Unusual graphics that work surprisingly well\n- Rowing the boat works quite well, and is really fun\n- Well voice acted\n- Interesting story\n\nCons:\n- The first part of the final boss battle was *extremely* frustrating\n- The presentation of the story could have evoked more emotion. I think it would have been improved if I was more emotionally invested in the character I was playing.\n\nVerdict: 8/10","timestamp_created":1607215092,"timestamp_updated":1607215092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkoLfmvYCd5vRtwI="}
