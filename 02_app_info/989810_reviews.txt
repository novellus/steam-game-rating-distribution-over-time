You are going to get several high quality models, they are mostly well textured also, the textures even look a little bit worn (I like that personally). It looks like a little thought went into them also as they cover a lot of basics (at least for a kitchen mostly). A couple are even really cool (like the pull out bed couch, WOW! or even the dirty dishes, very useful). \n\nNow for the bad. About half this collection (at lest 30+ models) are again made up of things we just don't need (and definitely not something you need 12 of) these are the trash bags and boxes (3 or 4 of each would have been more then enough for this collection but no they give you 12+ each????). (BTW there is a minor error on at least one of the trash bags maybe 2 where you can only see the top texture on one side of it). This makes me think they just made a lot of these models because they are easy to make which does not mean a quality pack.    \n\nWhats odd is that you don't get a kitchen table you don't get any chairs there's no TV or stereo system no rugs no bathtubs or toilets (again prolly not really needed, but still, have these people actually lived in an apartment???). IDK what The Game Creators are doing with these new sets of models, so far they are really missing the mark (imo). The older sets usually included things you needed  and a few of them were must haves (like the sci-fi one) the new ones just seem kinda thrown togather for no real purpose?? Again I just have to shake my head. Overall at this point it is not worth the money (I bought it on sale even). Honestly you can find larger user made collections/packs on their store that are almost as good as what you will find here and they are almost always more useful.","timestamp_created":1561405992,"timestamp_updated":1561405992,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550345659255981445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJXDxesCdJqYxAE="}
