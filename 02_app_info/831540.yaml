    review: "The 4 cgs are 'okay', but man the characters all suck. There's not enough\
      \ development in any of them to want to pick them. The game only has one choice\
      \ at the end to pick who you want to date, but it feels like there are plenty\
      \ of places where they could have had branches with different choices and just\
      \ decided not to do that.\n\nYou spend like 2 seconds of time with the guy and\
      \ the weird girl and then for some reason date them anyway if you choose them.\
      \ And then the other two are just insufferable. The closest to a three dimensional\
      \ character is Karina and even that's a bit much, but most of her dimension\
      \ shows up when you pick someone else. Since she's the only one that cares enough\
      \ about the MC [for some reason] to want him to be happy even if it's not with\
      \ her. \n\nYou'd think that would be the \"best friend\" from childhood, but\
      \ nope. Just the random girl who when you first meet her is yelling at you for\
      \ parking in her spot. And then just says she likes you even though your only\
      \ interactions thus far were her being mean to you. \n\nThere's also just no\
      \ reason any of the characters like you. It's just very tropey and boring overall.\
      \ It's just not worth it. If it were free, it would have been fine. I've played\
      \ better free kinetic novels and visual novels."
