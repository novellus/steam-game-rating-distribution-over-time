Finding puzzles are the real pain here. I had to use a guide to finish the game. Kinda liked the story but it doesn't worth to waste time. Puzzles were too childish at the beginning, but after ch3 they became boring. And if you miss a puzzle you have to play the whole game again, it is insane... I always like puzzle games but this one just was not my favorite.","timestamp_created":1588069685,"timestamp_updated":1603219603,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54304039478302002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ447fVo/UCe5CGhAI="}
