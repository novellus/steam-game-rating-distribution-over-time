    developer_response: 'Hi,

      I''m a game developer. I do new levels.

      Thank you for your constructive criticism.

      I''ll take your suggestions into account.


      I updated the game.

      Fixed an issue where the overlay images are not displayed properly.

      + I delete Player Health Bar.

      When the HP of a player character reaches 50% - there is Yellow Smoke.

      When the HP of a player character reaches 25% - there is Red Smoke.'

      this game has got some issues.  first and most importantly, the overlay images
      are not displayed properly. you will see double vision of your aiming reticle
      and the health bars. i suspect that what you see in your right eye, you are
      supposed to see in your left eye and vice versa. that makes it so you actually
      have to aim between the 2 reticles that you see. that''s uncomfortable on the
      eyes.


      secondly, this game is extremely repetative. you will fight wave after wave
      of exactly the same ship... on the first stage alone.  this is not helped by
      the fact that there is so little to look at and the fact that your ship is the
      same ship as the enemy ships for some reason. even when you get to a different
      stage and you are given a different ship, guess what? the enemy ships on that
      stage are also your new ship.


      speaking of repetative... if you watch the video for this game and turn on the
      sound... get used to that song. it plays non stop over and over and over again
      and it''s only like a minute maybe a minute and a half. there are also no sound
      effects, despite the option to turn on/off sound in the menu.


      this game does not claim to be in early access, but it sure feels like it. there
      are a bunch of simple things that could have been done to make this better.
      1- on stages where you have to fight off waves of enemies, tell the player how
      many more enemies need to be killed. 2- on stages where you need to blow up
      a specific object, have an arrow indicate where that object is when you''re
      not looking at it. 3- sound effects. 4- have some kind of transition between
      stages. something a little more interesting than ''mission complete wait 7 seconds''
      and ''destroy red ships'' or whatever. give us stats from the previous stage,
      tell us why we need to blow up the freightor/enemy ships. 5- add some variation
      to the enemies you face in a stage. 6- don''t have the enemies absorb so much
      damage. with the way the ships move, and the amount of time it takes to slowly
      destroy them this feels like space tanks. it should be like 4 laser shots or
      2 torpedo shots to destroy a normal enemy ship. 6- increase the fire rate of
      the lasers (also make the lasers more visable) 7- give some sort visual representation
      of the cool down on the torpedos (eg- have the aiming reticle turn red and refill
      toward green as torpedos recharge)'
