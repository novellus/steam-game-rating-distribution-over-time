    review: "Update: Tried a few more times just to get past the beginning of the\
      \ game with no luck. It is WAY too dark and I can't see or find anything besides\
      \ two doors that say they need keys. This game NEEDS a brightness slider. I\
      \ wandered around blindly in the dark clicking on everything trying to find\
      \ a key. No luck. Are there even any keys to begin with? I have no idea what\
      \ this game wants from me to continue. I can't see and there is no way to open\
      \ the doors. Into the refund pile you go! I'm outtie 5000.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\
      \nThis is really messy. I give some leeway given that it is a single Dev, but\
      \ this game REALLY should have been beta tested before release because it is\
      \ nearly unplayable.\n\nI purchased this for $5 on sale and I'm shocked by the\
      \ pile of unfinished mess I've gotten. I don't normally refund because I believe\
      \ in letting the money go to future development, but I am seriously considering\
      \ it this time. \n\nFirst, the game had a really hard time actually starting.\
      \ I clicked play and my computer sat there for a solid twenty seconds before\
      \ anything even happened. When 99% of my games start instantly, this was troubling.\
      \ Then it attempted to start the game in VR mode, which stopped responding and\
      \ crashed. Probably because this is not the machine that I have set up for VR\
      \ so there was NO headset to detect. And further, this game isn't even VR!!\
      \ Wth??\n\nThe game tried to access a nonexistent VR headset a second time and\
      \ I was able to close the window that popped up. Jesus. For a game that is not\
      \ VR, it seemed to really want to be played that way. \n\nI finally get to the\
      \ menu and it's pretty straightforward, but no graphics options. Ok... I've\
      \ played other games like that and they weren't bad. I kept going. \n\nYou start\
      \ the game and it takes you to a briefly written plot synopsis. Woman disappears,\
      \ sends a letter asking for help, and here you are. Got it. You have to hit\
      \ 'backspace' to make the story go away. Then once you find your footing, your\
      \ eyes are assaulted by giant white letters telling you that there IS in fact\
      \ a graphics menu! Errrr, ok! I hit the designated letter 'G' to get there.\
      \ \n\nIt said that everything was set to low quality so I bumped them all up\
      \ to medium to see what a higher setting looked like. I hit 'C' to close and\
      \ feel annoyed that the Esc key isn't universally used to shut all menus as\
      \ it would be in a standard game. Annoyed and frustrated. Not a great start.\
      \ I just wanted to play the game at this point.\n\nI back out of the graphics\
      \ menu and everything looks like doodoo. What the hell happened? I hit 'G' again.\
      \ The graphics once again say they are all set to low. What? I just changed\
      \ these! What is going on? \n\nI tried to keep playing, but then the game sound\
      \ screeched and stuttered like when the starter on your car engine goes out.\
      \ Reeeeeeeeeeeee-tickey-tickey-tickey-tickey-BOOM!! And crashed to the desktop.\
      \ Whoa. \n\nAll of that being said, I'm really stubborn and do my best to try\
      \ and get through the game anyway. But as it is, this is an unplayable mess\
      \ that is priced at nearly $10 retail. Nope. Nope! NOPE!!"
