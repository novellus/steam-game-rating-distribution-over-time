    about_the_game: <strong>SHIPS:</strong> Every ship is different. You start with
      one, but every time you kill a boss for the first time, you get a new one, that's
      just a little bit better. Use this to your advantage when fighting more difficult
      enemies.<br><br><strong>COMBAT:</strong> Every game you play will start on the
      first boss. Once it dies, you move on to the next, and that goes on until you
      beat the latest boss that has been added to the game. Where the difficulty comes
      in is when you get hit, at all, as then you will die and have to restart your
      journey at the very first boss. Don't worry too much, however, because you will
      always keep any ships you got, so the first few bosses will get easier every
      time you fight them.

    short_description: 'Kill it. Take its gun. Rinse and repeat. WARNING: You will
      die. A lot. Probably. This 2D Retro shooter is about as hard as it can get,
      but repetition and good luck will cut though everything like warm cheese. This
      game grows with the community, and more bosses will challenge you in the future.'
