    review: "This game is so delightful for lovers of fairy tales and hidden objects\
      \ alike.  \n\nIt has different difficulty levels and an engaging simple story\
      \ line.  \n\nI like how instead of just finding items from a list, you are actually\
      \ exploring - opening items that need items to unlock it's prize.  The items\
      \ needed are from the various places you've already visited.  \n\nThere is a\
      \ tip system if you are stuck, although the puzzles are not difficult.  This\
      \ game is perfect for relaxing with enjoyable visuals.  \n\nThis is the first\
      \ time for me to play this type of game, and i chose it for something to do\
      \ when I needed something quiet and simple to occupy my time.\n\nI can picture\
      \ this being enjoyable for people of all ages - or even playing together with\
      \ children.  They would be delighted with the sparkles and fairy wand sound\
      \ effects.\n\nThis is a short game, but there are items to return to collect\
      \ and seek out if you don't find them on the first run through.\n\nI'd be happy\
      \ to answer any of your questions about this game in the comments!\n\nEdit:\
      \ The game is longer that I originally thought!\n\nPros:\n-Great graphics\n\
      -Compelling simple story cutscenes\n-Increasingly complex puzzles\n-Tips in\
      \ an active window of what type of item to seek or what type of item to obtain\n\
      -Pleasant, non distracting music and sound effects\n-The collectible section\
      \ has additional puzzles and rewards when all of one set is acquired\n-More\
      \ than one player can have a \"save\" and player is easy to switch\n-Low computer\
      \ system requirements\n-can play in windowed mode and do two things at once\
      \ \n-You have the ability to skip a puzzle after completing a certain number\
      \ in a row\n\nCons\n-Intro cutscene replays each time the game opens - the escape\
      \ key bypasses it\n-No \"undo\" option for a puzzle, so a complete reset would\
      \ be required\n-I haven't found a way yet to go back to the area I missed pages\
      \ for my creature collection book - this is a MAJOR CON as I went into the final\
      \ area and the game ended but i hadn't completed all the areas.  When I go to\
      \ the bonus content, I can't access it because I haven't \"finished the game\"\
      .  Going back into the game takes me to the final cutscene and there's nothing\
      \ I can do\n-To replay the game, you have to play as a new player name apparently\n\
      \nOverall, besides the disappointment at the end (which you can avoid if you\
      \ check the menu logs before moving to a new area) at not having completed the\
      \ game apparently, I'd definitely still give this game a big thumbs up!"
