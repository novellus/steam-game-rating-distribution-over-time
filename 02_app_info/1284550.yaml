    developer_response: "Hi GreyEndurance! Thank you so much for playing our game!\n\
      \nThank you very much for the feedback, we seek as far as possible we are always\
      \ looking to improve the experience of our players in the games.\n\nWe write\
      \ down all your observations and we will study them with care.\n\nRegarding\
      \ the word that is triggered when the multiplier increases, we are studying\
      \ the possibility of removing it or giving the option to disable it.\n\nCertainly\
      \ songs made especially for the game would be fantastic, but we still don't\
      \ have enough resources for that.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no possibility\
      \ for two players to play on the same keyboard, as part of the commands are\
      \ made by the mouse, to play Coop mode or PVP it is necessary to have at least\
      \ one control, because this way a player would stay on the keyboard and mouse\
      \ and the other in control.\n\nAs we are a tiny studio, working on our little\
      \ free time, negative reviews really impact a lot. If you can reconsider and\
      \ post your review as positive, after the next updates, even with your considerations,\
      \ that would mean too much for us and would certainly be a huge support.\n\n\
      Thanks for alerting us to our name on the ranking list, in one of our tests\
      \ we forgot to remove it.\n\nThanks again for playing our game and we\u2019\
      re glad you did."

    review: "I love shape games and saw this on special offer. Allured by the bright\
      \ effects and promise of a competitive environment I decided to give it a go,\
      \ not at any risk really as I got this for just over a \xA3. \n\nThe controls\
      \ are innovative for a shooter, using all four edges of the screen through the\
      \ teleport system. Shapes with different colours and movement patterns pass\
      \ across the screen for your ship to fire upon, an emphasis on accuracy is highlighted\
      \ early on and your score ramps up in chain through a rather standard multiplier\
      \ system. \n\nSimilar to fellow space shooter title Ikaruga, this game uses\
      \ colour to diversify the experience, requiring you to use the switchable colour\
      \ of the ship to shoot the corresponding colour and increase your score throughout\
      \ the 2 stage round in each level, this adds opportunity for further finesse\
      \ and difficulty. The ranking structure is simple and understandable. The global\
      \ scoring system is rather interesting and unique, I think it is the stand out\
      \ feature of the game being that you must use your score to upgrade the ship\
      \ as a currency. If you were no1 on the leaderboard and decided to go all out\
      \ on the next model, your motivated to try and build that score back up to reach\
      \ the top spot once again. This is can see as both a positive and negative in\
      \ peoples differing opinion but I personally like the originality. \n\nThe blurb\
      \ for the game on the stores is what I would call half true, in that competition\
      \ is a key element and will hopefully grow with time, however the music and\
      \ sounds is where I started to see issues. Which, being that this is a feel\
      \ the beats type title, was disappointing. \n\nThe first issue during play was\
      \ this repeated word (which I will spell wrong no doubt) \u201CContrau\u201D\
      \ which triggered when you increase your multiplier, I heard it constantly over\
      \ the course of each round and it really got on my nerves toward the end of\
      \ my play time, so much so I had to turn off SFX to continue on with the game.\
      \ \n\nWhy not just say double, triple, quadruple and max? Or nothing, that works\
      \ too. \n\nMusic in general could be better and more fitting for a neon style\
      \ game, it's rather bland in places and repetitive. The round victory music\
      \ especially seemed rather out of place. Note to YAW - Please see the game 'Super\
      \ Hexagon' for an example of music style I believe would better suit this title.\
      \ If it\u2019s is indeed a beats game, It would be nice if you could apply your\
      \ own music to it and the shapes could be a bit more connected to the music\
      \ rhythm itself. This is just a standard shooter and music is not is key feature,\
      \ in my opinion. One of the music packs is called Stinky Toilet, which I found\
      \ ironic.  \n\nAs mentioned previously, the colours and effects are great, the\
      \ developer has kindly taken the time and consideration to apply a photosensitivity\
      \ warning when the game loads up (needed as this game is a light show in it's\
      \ own right) and I must say that I absolutely love the level starting sequence\
      \ shown as the beginning of each level. The 'enemies' or shapes that are your\
      \ targets have a hit box which is indicated by the column following in it's\
      \ wake, however you will quickly notice that the triangles extend in size past\
      \ the column and is a little unnatural feeling when you felt assured that you\
      \ hit a corner of the shape, yet the shot didn't count due to not being within\
      \ this column. To correct this a change could be made to ensure the full shape\
      \ stays inside the column, further allowing you to control the ship through\
      \ peripheral vision. \n\nWith a few extra features and much better music, this\
      \ would be a fine title for my pick up and play library. \n\n3/10. \n\nBugs\
      \ and notes\nRanking position 99 to 10? (It doesn't display as rank 100) \n\n\
      When the mission is complete, shapes can still reach the bottom of the map and\
      \ deduct score, minor thing, still annoying. \n\nThere are a few typos in the\
      \ game itself, I am always guilty of the odd typo but this is a paid for product\
      \ so should be cleared up, one in particular which jumped out at me was that\
      \ the community tab is spelt Comunity."
