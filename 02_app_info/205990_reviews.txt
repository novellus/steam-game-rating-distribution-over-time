The crashes happen for me in 2 different PC's so it's not a problem on my end, and also looking around the internet I've seen other users experiencing the same. If you can't support your game, pdox, don't effin sell it. I paid for this and I refuse to spend more time fixing than playing.","timestamp_created":1610012896,"timestamp_updated":1610012896,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOWP7vYCdumdwQI="}
