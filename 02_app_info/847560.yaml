    review: "Our Hero! First puts you in the shoes (or paws, I think) of what seems\
      \ to be a cat, in service of the king of the game's world. Your duty, as the\
      \ chosen hero, is to save the land by taking back a precious crystal that holds\
      \ some pretty neat powers.\n\nThe game starts off slow, giving you time to get\
      \ used to the characters and how the combat system works. After that, things\
      \ start to get harder as you progress with more obstacles coming your way and\
      \ much more powerful monsters.\nThere's no difficulty option which in a way\
      \ I like a lot. It gives off that nostalgic feeling of how old games used to\
      \ be.\n\nThe hack n slash part of the game does take a little while to master,\
      \ as it can be pretty jumpy at times, but with a little effort, you can get\
      \ the hang of it quite alright.\nYour hero can get more powerful by purchasing\
      \ better weapons and accessories to increase his stats in combat. They are a\
      \ must if you want to have an easier time surviving the hordes of monsters.\n\
      If you're not careful and want to collect every single item on the go, I advise\
      \ caution. You need to plan your investments a bit here as there may be times\
      \ where you'll have no healing food left to survive the next chambers so be\
      \ sure to always be stocked on that.\n\nNow let's move on to the world itself.\n\
      You're going to go through different biomes in your adventures, ranging from\
      \ green forests and deserts to icy lands and fiery volcanoes. You've got all\
      \ the colors mother nature already graces us with in real life.\nEach biome\
      \ has it's own set of monsters and obstacles specific to that zone and you will\
      \ need to be prepared when you enter them. \n\nThe fun part is that besides\
      \ the main quest that takes you through all these zones, there's also a few\
      \ side quests you can accept that will reward you with items or currency to\
      \ spend. It's a fun side activity to do when you don't really feel like saving\
      \ the world.\nI don't want to go in big details here since there's spoilers\
      \ but even after finishing the main story, there will be new stuff to do so\
      \ replayability is there in case you want some more.\n\nAs a last tip, be sure\
      \ to talk to any NPC you see. Some of them have special rewards for you for\
      \ tasks as simple as killing 30 monsters.\nTake your time and explore everything,\
      \ like in any RPG! :)\n\nFor the current price tag that the game has, I'd say\
      \ it's well worth it. You can get at least a few hours of content and that is\
      \ if you plan on speedrunning the whole thing.\nIf you take your time and playing\
      \ it casually, it can easily take you 4 to 5 hours to finish the whole thing.\
      \ Plus some more if you want to keep going after you're done with the main quest.\n\
      A game well worth spending your day on.\n"
