      \ the unusual shmups of the early 90s that were going against the standard spaceship\
      \ fare at the time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTORY:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe year is\
      \ 2182, it's been almost a decade since the Zeno Wars have ended, with the threat\
      \ no more, civlizations all across the galaxy have begun to rebuild their society.\
      \ One such civlization, are the weird humanoid animals living on what humans\
      \ named, Earth &quot;J&quot;, the home planet of none other than Makoto Kitsune,\
      \ the rather odd Fox woman who helped win the Zeno Wars.  And she's... a J-Pop\
      \ idol?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, peace didn't last long as... some mean-spirited\
      \ animals clearly don't want her singing! Her tours being constantly ruined\
      \ by some angry people, Makoto got mad, so mad, she became a crimesweeper, going\
      \ on a personal vendetta against those who ruined her musical tours. This musical,\
      \ is gonna be full of bullets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY:<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nJet Buster is a more accessible shoot-em'up compared to the previous Grybanser\
      \ Fox titles, where Normal is 100% serious about being Normal. Of course, there's\
      \ always an Expert mode for those who are looking forward for a bigger challenge.<br\

    review: 'Saw this from a video from a spuky scary skeleton and had to get it.
      Incredibly fun shmup with lots of playable characters and great retro inspired
      music and visuals. The artstyle is really nice and the mechanics for scoring
      are really fun when you can chain up medals. There''s a coin system that lets
      you accumulate continues, and every run lets you get points to spend to unlock
      characters and, with enough points, unlmited continues.


      I''ve played another STG game from these devs and feel like all of their stuff
      can be recommended for all shmup lovers.'
