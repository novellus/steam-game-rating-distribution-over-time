    review: 'FALSE ADVERTISING!

      I wanted this route for the K&L Trainz locomotives they were advertising and
      didn''t receive them. DO NOT buy this product expecting the K&L Loco''s, this
      is false advertising.

      I would like my money back so I can spend it on something that won''t scam me.'
