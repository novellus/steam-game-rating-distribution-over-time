Game would have been much better off if the \"stages\" leading up to the boss fights were significantly smaller. Like 80% of the map area can be cut without losing any interesting gameplay, that is how empty and repetitive the world feels.","timestamp_created":1609106863,"timestamp_updated":1609106863,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483697593212127686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ucaP0/YCeu7yvQI="}
