Found it a little hard to start with but once I worked out the controls it was great fun. Have managed to craft some survival tools and made some weapons........... Hunted chickens and I'm ready for the first night Orcs. BRING IT ON!!\n\nCool sounds and music in game. Would say the game needs a little polishing up in areas but I'm sure that will come in any updates. Would love to see an Island creator or a selection of different Island maps to keep things interesting. \n\nWill keep playing this game, when my children allow. They love Minecraft and have now had a play of this. The creative side is  a huge feature of this game, you can change the shape of blocks in game. COOL. Some great Island camp ideas spring to mind.\n\nAs the game is now I would give it a high 3 to a 4 out of 5. If the devloper reads this please keep working on the game, be sure to love my idea of an Island maker and as I say polish it up a touch more.\n\nCheck it out, fun and challenging game.","timestamp_created":1528283604,"timestamp_updated":1528283604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.406817883253097534","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwqSz6uMCcoWeogE="}
