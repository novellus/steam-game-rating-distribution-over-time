    review: 'Small but extremely fun & underrated game


      Summary: it''s like a gameplay mashup between Time Crisis and Super Hot. At
      each step of a level, you are essentially in a bubble fighting an incoming wave
      of enemies. You can perform quick dodges inside of the bubble with your thumbstick,
      and you can also dodge with your own body. Once you beat a wave, a red marker
      appears -- you click your trigger at it and warp to the next wave location with
      your full HP back. Sometimes you can choose between two different markers that
      affect the path you take thru the level.


      Enemy bullets travel relatively slowly so you can see a muzzle flash and physically
      dodge bullets (by leaning, ducking, etc). At any time you can trigger bullet
      time slo-mo, but time only moves as slowly as your physically move. The better
      you get at the game, the less you have to use bullet time and more start to
      feel like the combat droid in Mandalorian. Level 2 and 3 give you katanas that
      you can use in either (or both) hand(s) and slice anything in half (including
      incoming bullets).


      Pros:

      +Constant action; can feel like a workout if you get really into it

      +Excellent haptics; firing the guns just feels *good*

      +Enemy designs just overall look cool, and the ones introduced in level 3 are
      awesome

      +Slashing things cleanly in half with a katana is immensely satisfying in VR

      +Aesthetically (after level 1) it reminds me of 90''s era robot anime

      +There are three levels total, but each has a very different look and are meant
      to be played multiple times (beating the game unlocks progressively harder difficulties).
      In order, the levels are: 1) a simulation that looks very similar to Super Hot
      (white walls, minimalistic enemies), 2) a factory (enemies now look fully fleshed
      out compared to level 1 and you gain access to the katanas), and 3) the best
      looking map of the 3; a Halo-esque landscape.

      +Enemy variety is shockingly good for such a small game once you get past level
      1


      Cons:

      +The gameplay is simply not well-explained; this is the biggest issue by far
      and takes time to truly understand how it all works. For example, Locomotion
      seems broken at first until you realize it''s meant as a dodge, not for long-distance
      travel. Also, pulling out your katana requires a holding the trigger for a second
      rather than just a quick click -- I fired a ton of bullets over my shoulder
      before I figured that out.

      +Level 1, while fun, is far more simplistic (looking and gameplay-wise) than
      2 or 3 -- many players may get turned off thinking that level 1 is indicative
      of the entire game''s variety/quality

      +By default the volume seemed extremely loud compared to other games (easy to
      fix in the options, but not a pleasant first impression)

      +The game didn''t sell enough copies to warrant the additional content they
      were planning for it


      Highly recommended, and I hope one day this game gets picked up by a streamer
      or something so that sales justify either the updates they had been planning
      or a new game by the same developers.'
