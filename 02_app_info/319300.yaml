    review: I'm done. Just done. This dumb-as-crap rage-filled game is broken as frick.
      I'm trying not to swear, but trust me, I would say every cuss word in the English
      dictionary 20 times if I could. There is ALWAYS this annoying-as-Fred car in
      one of the UK levels that always stops too close to the crossing gate. Therefore,
      the train crashes into that car and the level is basically impossible because
      of that one bug. I've already played the 12th simulator you made and I started
      to wonder if the series was actually made by EA. (In other words, you basically
      simp for money.) So yeah, not only do I not like this game, but the entire Trainz
      Simulator series.
