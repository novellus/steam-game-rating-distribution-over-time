It could work out if the game was more smooth and if it had better music. The achievements doesn't have any explanation either and you have no idea if you have completed the game. This would fit better as a shitty mobile game with ads in every corner. This is the game you would play while waiting for your mom to finish in the bathroom at the mall.","timestamp_created":1606664398,"timestamp_updated":1606664398,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546834349632263184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6SqivYCdvGktQI="}
