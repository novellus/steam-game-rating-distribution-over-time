    review: 'Very interesting game: turn based strategy with simple but innovative
      mechanics.

      Easy to learn but hard to master; it remains interesting through time.

      Promotes environmental awareness; interesting story.

      Relaxing and entertaining music.

      One of the best indie games.'
