    review: 'Animation could be better but it''s ok, my and my friends like it though,
      we get a kick out of it.

      Different kind of zombies but they all seemed to slide on the floor if you escape
      from them.

      You can lure the zombies to the train tracks and they suffer a terrible death!

      Overall is good, would like to see more action but you can explore as long as
      you avoid enemies.

      Like riding the trains, they have a schedule and reminded me of my time in Europe.

      Waiting to see if they make a multiplayer so that we can all play.
