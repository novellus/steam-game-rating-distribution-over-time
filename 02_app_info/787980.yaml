    review: 'It''s a pretty basic remake of the classic Minesweeper, but in 4 dimensions


      Pros:

      - it''s 4D

      - the "donut" field mode

      - the "delta" mode for the numbers lets you exclude some trivial calcualtions


      So-so:

      - I recall a few similar games from the 2000s (e.g. Minefield 6D) which had
      all this stuff and even more features, e.g. 3D, and 5D+ fields. I still like
      that there is a game on Steam about 4D, finally (I can''t wait until Miegacure
      comes out btw). Though this game, since it''s on Steam, should have at least
      to be better than free old apps out there..


      Cons:

      - frequent crashes in the recent update (after you start new game and click
      on cell (0, 0, 0, 0) it seems to always crash

      - dull look, and all those "0" tiles which create clutter. Even the original
      Microsoft''s game probably looked better than this one

      - I''m pretty sure that using "Minesweeper" in the title is not allowed since
      the name is Microsoft''s trademark. Even on Linux this game was called "Mines"
      to avoid a lawsuit from M$

      - left+right click should open all tiles around the clicked one, if the number
      of flagged tiles around it is the same as the number on the tile - that''s how
      the original Minesweeper worked


      Overall: finally something 4D on Steam, but needs work. So far it looks like
      a shool/student assignment, not ready for a commercial release both in presentation
      and in feature set.'
