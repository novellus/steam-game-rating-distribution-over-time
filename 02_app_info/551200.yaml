    about_the_game: Mick Taylor returns to wreak havoc in the long form drama series,
      WOLF CREEK.  Except this time things are different. This time the victim fights
      back. At first the pattern is familiar; Mick chooses an American family on vacation
      in northern Australia to terrorize and destroy, but that is merely the inciting
      incident in a much larger story. Seriously injured, 19-year-old Eve survives
      the massacre of her parents and little brother, recovers and sets out to bring
      the killer to justice. Across the 6 episodes we chart her complex and extraordinary
      journey, travelling every step of the way with her as she evolves from child
      to adult, from prey to predator. But can she triumph over Mick Taylor, evil
      incarnate?
