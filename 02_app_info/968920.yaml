    review: At this point in development I do not recommend it due to its lack of
      certain features. If the camera can roam freely I suggest having a recenter
      button. I hate zooming of into the distance and then losing my ship due to me
      zooming out to far. Another good thing to add is color to the resource icons;
      some people can not tell the difference from the steel bars and the gold bars.
      It would also be fantastic if there was faster fast-forward buttons (maybe up
      to 32). The game also needs its UI revamped, almost nobody likes to look at
      a screen with nothing but a few white buttons and a semi-transparent background
      that is also white. take this critique lightly and maybe consider the addition
      of the listed elements.
