Everything you need to know is inside within the files, but long story short, you are going to participate in a ''cleaning'' mission for quite some time. The boss sees you as a great asset in order to finish the mission, we have fueled your spaceship and powered its weaponry, the mission will start today so report to the deck and be ready, we wish you good luck soldier...''\n\n[h1] Story: [/h1]\n\nBeing the role of an underpaid space trooper, your mission is to do a ''cleaning'' in some spotted sectors suspected of alien activity in the name of your boss's Capitalism, do a good job and get back, you might receive a bonus in your salary... or something else.\n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\n\nStill following the genre of an arcade, shoot 'em up type of game, this DLC is a prequel of the events that led to the main game in which your objective is to erradicate any alien life form of the sectors you were sent by your boss, starting with only one character, in which later you unlock more through the achievements you achieve, including as well multiple abilities and different weaponry for each character. Powerups continues to be a presence with some new defences and attack updates such examples of it are ''one more HP'' which gives you another life while ''mega beam'' and ''mirrored shooting'' are only acquired on the third segment of the game.\n\nIn terms of controls, still continues to be the same but with some new advancements and for those who dislike the keyboard, it features a controller setup just like in the main game and on the menu, the ''palettes'' have been replaced by ''achievements'', now you can keep track on your statistics as well the stunts completed by performing certain tasks.  The option menu is still minimalistic and now you get a new option of changing your play style, wether it being keyboard plus mouse or just controller.\n\nWhat about the visuals of the game? My only answer is, it finally simulates that arcade feel to it, the pixels are perfect in every form and shapes on screen while the velocity of the AI and the rate of fire plays a small contribution to it. As I mentionned regarding the palettes, sadly there isn't, to my perspective would be cool but I don't think it would be needed.\n\nIt is cool for the DLC having achievements, cooler when I discovered I could unlock different characters with it, even though it isn't a challenge, some are time consuming while the rest you can achieve right on your first gameplay. Maybe if it were a bit more pleasing in terms of unlocking a character, lets say for example, the ''Kill 900 gellatine | AAZ'' switches places with ''Die 50 times | AAZ''.\n\n[h1] Glitches/Bugs/Errors report: [/h1]\n\nIt barely shows any bugs and glitches in the game besides one of the unlockable characters when he gets a weaponry powerup, it doesn't show the type it has improved, but anything else from that, no problems whatsoever.\n\n[h1] Overall: [/h1]\n\nI quite frankly enjoyed this DLC, unlike the main game, it definitely has got a balance between the overload of powerups and the challenge it provides during gameplay, except of course in the third segment where in some instances, you will get massive amounts of ''mirrored shooting'', besides from that, I believe in terms of the unlockable characters with their different weapons, spacecraft style and their abilities the difficulty in these aspects could be stepped up a bit, but since in some characters their weaponry changes and some of the abilities are locked throughout the gameplay, probably would be the best just to keep the difficulty at its level.\nIt is a DLC that I would recommend for my friends to play to better understand the story and \n where the main game is set, could have some small adjustments, but in the end, it is just a game that I will always come back.\n\nScore: 9.5/10 \n\n\n [h1] -Written and posted on the group/curator ''The (almost) honest opinion'', also known as, ''T(A)HO'', come and join the group and/or the curator page for more reviews such as this one!\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thealmosthonestopinion] Group  [/url]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35541341/] Curator page  [/url] [/h1]","timestamp_created":1577658600,"timestamp_updated":1601309307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702817738056182861","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h57e6vQCeMaZ6AE="}
