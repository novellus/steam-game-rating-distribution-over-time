The concept isn't that interesting, it's a Fireboy and Watergirl clone right down to the colors, but from what I can tell, it has a good amount of depth to it, and the graphics are okay, but I still wish it was more original, and had more engaging gameplay. But after all, I can't be too hard on it, because it isn't trying to be all that much. It wasn't marketed to me as  the best game o the year, but rather a minimalistic puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1609185938,"timestamp_updated":1609185938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpZm91fYCc5GbvgI="}
