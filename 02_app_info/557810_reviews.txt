Unprofessional.  Would be a fun, hard, clicker game if not for all the bugs that literally break the game progress and force restarting before ready, and reward so little your power never feels like it's going up.\n\nStill do not reccomend the game, still has original problems and more. Doesn't look like the company knows what it is doing. Avoiding \"Fox Dawn\" now, another junk Dev/Publisher that is trying to make a quick buck without finishing the games they start.\n\n\n\n// Original Post//\nToo many problems to enjoy.\nBalance issue is terrible.\nAway bug not giving/displaying proper gold (forcing to keep playing if you want to advance at all)\nGiant Brick wall that can only be avoided if you go to zone 3, ascend, repeatedly and use the \"free stars\" to boost your world STR/Crit so you can do more DPS. (very boring process too)  By repeatedly I mean over 100x as each time only seems to give 5 stars.\n\nDPS doesn't increase past level 150.  Known bug- no fix.\nSkills not working at all - or shutting off early - or not working properly in general.  Skill use is also extremely clunky - as you go to another tab/menu, scroll down to use it, and if you return to the buy heroes it's at the top again too - very cumbersome to always start at top of scroll lists instead of \"where you left off\"\n\nThis game should NOT have been released as/is - it is a ALPHA game as it is, and should be addressed properly. (Alpha means there are core problems being worked out or added to it that will shape the entire game, like adding Jumping to a platform game)\n\nFox Dawn needs to re-think how to balance things for the Gold required to level up the heroes VS the damage they dish out - relying too heavily on RNG Equipment drops is poor game mechanics.\n//////////////////////////","timestamp_created":1485339095,"timestamp_updated":1510552193,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605038940906524658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/qj72d8CdKy6cA=="}
