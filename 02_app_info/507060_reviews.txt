Sceal (Gealic for \"story\") is a wonderful innocent game about Iona, a little girl, who goes on a quest to recover her last memories. You will find yourself painting certain buildings, listen to the wisdom of Branna the raven and help different villagers, including your in-game parents. At the end of Chapter 3, you will have to choose one out of three persons in order to end your story. \n\nPROS:\n- Different languages, including Gaelic!\n- Awesome soundtracks!\n- Village represented in both night and day, and different seasons;\n- Storybook with rising buildings;\n- Ouvert and intern symbols;\n- Losts of interpretations can come up from this game;\n- It almost feels like William Butler Yeats and William Faulkner mixed together;\n- Better try Windowed version first of all, because... \n\nCONS:\n- ... because my system is not good and it ran in slow-motion, but it was nice!\n- This is all for the cons.\n\nTo sum it all, I think that people interested in nice simple stories from the children's point of view would be delighted to play this game. Remember: play it as innocent as a child! You will fall in love, first of all, with its soundtracks. They are instrumental and vocals. I hearby thank the developers for making such an amazing little story available to us and I want to see some more games like this!","timestamp_created":1595529567,"timestamp_updated":1595529567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4saO+vvMCeZ6RlwI="}
