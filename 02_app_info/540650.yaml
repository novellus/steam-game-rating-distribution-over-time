    review: I played this religiously for the past 3 weeks on my phone, and I can
      say I had a lot of fun in the experience. Although it's true that the game is
      buggy as hell, like being able to pass solid walls and stuff, and the very obvious
      sprite and sound rips from several different games, it shouldn't make you stop
      playing. I found it really fun to play if you have a lot of time, or enjoy grinding.
      My only complaint in this game is not having a Wiki page. Legit needs it as
      the game doesn't present you with much information other than the general tutorial.
      Oh and a fullscreen mode.
