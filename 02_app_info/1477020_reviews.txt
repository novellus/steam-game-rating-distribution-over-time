Now I am wondering, why Part 4 has become so terribly easy. It is no challenge at all which is a little bit sad. Is it really neccessary to do puzzles nowadays on a level, where small minded are able to follow to make it a commercial success? If so, then please make a own game line (\"Wordle Light\") for them and dont ruin the great mechanics of the game. Another suggestion: Make the display of the symbols an option.","timestamp_created":1609778499,"timestamp_updated":1609778499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ429GR5/YCe6S4wAI="}
