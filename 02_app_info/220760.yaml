      \ laboratory, stable, garden, and more. Use all-new tools like the drafting\
      \ table and carpenter\u2019s workbench to transform quarried stone, clay, and\
      \ sawn logs into structures and furnishings. Even transform your house into\
      \ a home by adopting children.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2><ul class=\"\
