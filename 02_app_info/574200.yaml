    review: 'Had some issues starting this game up, was due to not having a controller
      plugged in, so make sure you plug in a controller before starting the game up.


      Once I got it running I gave it a quick fling and found it was fun, but quite
      hard and gave that nice edf 4.1 vibe. It is grindy, but fun flying around shooting
      bugs and dodging incoming fire.


      I bought this game priced off at roughly 2 euro''s and for that price it is
      a steal and a fun thing to play once in a while to quickly dive into and shoot
      some bugs, full price it might be a bit too short to warrant the full price.


      Also make sure if you get this game that you install via the store the training
      missions free dlc to get some extra bang for your buck.'
