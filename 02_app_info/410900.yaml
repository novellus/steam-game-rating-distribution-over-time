      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Update highlights include...</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New\
      \ Multiplayer Training Missions!</h2>To help skill up new players, we have added\
      \ a new \u2018Training\u2019 tab to the multiplayer screen, under which are\
      \ three missions to teach rookie commanders some of the techniques they will\
      \ need to survive in online battles. Featuring an all new environment and SFX,\
      \ these missions teach AA defense skills, rush building and structural durability.\
      \ In addition to this, players can create their own training missions and upload\
      \ them via the Steam Workshop.<br><br>_______________________________<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/410900/extras/TonsOfGuns2.gif?t=1608754081\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tons of Guns</h2>This major free update adds two tech\
      \ buildings which allow commanders access to six formidable new weapons. The\
      \ Armoury unlocks Flak guns to clear the skies of enemy projectiles, and EMP\
      \ rockets to power down enemy tech, both of which can be upgraded to the Shotgun\
      \ and twin Rocket launcher, respectively. The classic Cannon is now found in\
      \ the new Munitions Plant, where it is joined by it's little brother, the burst-firing\
      \ 20mm Cannon. The Factory now produces two beam weapons, the classic Plasma\
      \ Laser and the new Firebeam, great for penetrating fortifications to ignite\
      \ them from within.<br><br>_______________________________<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Repair Station</h2>In an effort to reduce APM and to\
      \ add another element of strategy, we have created the Repair Station. Available\
      \ as a device built directly from the Reactor, the Repair Station repairs damage\
      \ to surrounding building materials and devices as and when they are damaged\
      \ in exchange for an ongoing resource cost. Multiple Repair Stations can be\
      \ built at a time, but should be placed with care to maximise their coverage,\
      \ while also ensuring they don\u2019t put too much of a strain on your economy.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Ranked Multiplayer</h2>Players who opt to play ranked matches\
      \ will have the result of their battles figure into their score, and their rank\

      \ months, with medals given out to the table toppers in both 1v1 and 2v2 arenas.<br><br>_______________________________<br><br><img\

    reviews: "\u201CBrisbane-based Earthwork Games has brought out a fort building\
      \ - and fort destroying - simulator that combines strategy, engineering, aiming,\
      \ and micromanagement. It's a fun cocktail that puts me in mind of Scorched\
      \ Earth, or maybe a Scorched Earth that let me build a bunker around my tank.\
      \ And then three more tanks on my bunker.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/05/forts-is-a-fun-mix-of-rts-and-worms/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>\u201CForts is an exceptional\
      \ example of how a release can properly integrate many mechanics, from multiple\
      \ genres, and get it right. The fast-paced challenge of managing multiple tasks\
      \ before you\u2019re obliterated creates a sense of urgency and an increased\
      \ heart rate that you wouldn\u2019t normally find from a title that simply leverages\
      \ one of these mechanics. Buy Forts, and make a solid investment in your game\
      \ library.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://opnoobs.com/reviews/indie/strategy/forts\"\
