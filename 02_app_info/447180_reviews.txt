Ignoring the disturbing fact that these pets fell in love with MC as pets, this game has some pretty weak storylines, including: a Curse (TM) without boundaries and logic, the dreaded \"love test\" where x condition will happen once you \"fall in love\" (how is that detectable??), pets turning into humans by eating some sort of berry, pets falling in love with their human, and a crappy ex-boyfriend who should have been dumped in the first place.\n\nThe Good:\n- Features a MC who is--oh, the horror!--not experiencing love for the first time, but has been cast aside by her current boyfriend, who is also a love interest. I like the idea of an otome game that explores a second love and the idea of finding love after a heartbreak. Actually, the game starts with MC's a** getting dumped. However, she is still very much the \"lady doth protest too much\" type, unfortunately.\n- Roughly half of the LIs were decent, if you squint and ignore the fact that they used to be MC's pets....... Ramin (the cockatoo) is super sweet and mature but still has a good banter and dynamic with the MC; Assam  (the pot-bellied pig) is also kind and considerate, though his route takes a dark turn that many players may not appreciate; and Lufna (the Russian blue cat) is sarcastic, lazy, and sometimes brutally honest, but also very attuned to the MC's thoughts. ...But proceed to The Oogly and reference the paragraphed phrases here for why this game was too problematic for a positive recommendation.\n- Sachi, MC's female friend. Honestly, it is so rare to find a positive named female influence in otome games that even though Sachi isn't a very developed and fleshed-out character, I took to her immediately since the only other female presences are usually Bitchy Rivals, of which there is also one in this game. -_-\n\nThe Oogly:\n- Pets are supposed to be like children to their owners, are they not? Maybe in some instances, they can be like siblings, if you were \"raised\" simultaneously with them by your parents (as it indicates Ramin was). Either way, they are not supposed to be objects of lust, even after they become attractive men. I don't know WHERE this concept was conceived or how it got the green light to proceed forward. It's just a bit disturbing and I was never able to shake off that sense of impending horror, despite how sweet some of the LIs were. While I was able to stomach the pets-into-humans story in [i]Dandelion[/i] since MC had only raised them for three months, it was a little more disturbing here as MC constantly talks about how many years she's been raising these pets--one of which she's had since she was a child.\n- MC is sexually experienced but still comes off as protesting a LOT even when she is in the mood. I understand this is due to cultural expectations, modesty and embarrassment, but it's ideas like these that contribute to rape culture: \"You have to protest to sexual advances even if they're appreciated, otherwise you'll be a slut!\" \"Try and try again if at first you don't succeed with your romantic overtures!\" \"Ignore what her mouth is saying in favor of what her [i]body[/i] is saying!\" GRRR.\n- Two of the routes were trash routes, imo. One, I think most folks would agree; the other may be more up in the air. (Also some people may not like one of the routes I liked due to a dark twist that occurs mid-route.)\n- Some of the plots are really, REALLY weak. Like it's not even a suspension of disbelief, but doing away with logic altogether. The very idea of animals becoming humans is WEIRD and IMPOSSIBLE in the first place, so you have to establish some sort of semi-logical reason for why this can occur. Another game with pet LIs uses a magician who grants wishes to get past this loophole, and indeed that is also a very weak way of explaining how it happens, but at least it's SOMETHING. Magic usually explains everything away anyways, right?\n- The stories are pretty short and instalove abounds. MC goes from crying her heart out after getting dumped in the Prologue to falling in love with one of her pets within the first two or three chapters, which is basically two or three days. I get that this isn't a sweeping epic, but at least give it a little more time??\n- This is a typical otome game in the sense that players raise affection by selecting dialogue among two or more options. Like the other D3 games I've played so far, there are no bad endings, but if your affection isn't high enough, you'll get the generic happy ending, rather than the Super Happy (or Miracle, in this game) ending. Some options don't do anything, while others will have an option that raises affection. Some of these choices do not make any sense, as what I picked up on is that you can raise sufficient affection for Miracle Ending by [b]always choosing the option that benefits the entire group[/b] where available. This doesn't always make sense as sometimes that option launches dialogue that shows the particular LI is upset. Took me forever to get Reito's best ending due to this weird and illogical structure.\n\nIf the pet concept isn't icky enough for you, then I'd dissuade you because the content isn't sufficient for a full-fledged game. I read every scenario in under five hours and while I did like a couple of the LIs, the stories weren't good enough to return to for a second read. Maybe if it's deeply discounted or if you do like sugary stories without much substance.","timestamp_created":1604877885,"timestamp_updated":1604877885,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45KOL1fUCc8yfrQI="}
