For a three seconds, you get a +5% bonus to the damage you do to enemy, but the enemy becomes to attack 25% faster. So, the enemy's total damage per time of skill's usage becomes roughly 125%, when yours (considering you can attack about 1 time in a second) - only about 105%. So, most probably, you just lessen your ability to kill enemies, before they get you, which on a high level may be a real problem.\n\nA story of that character - mentioned in the DLC's description? If it was intended to be funny, it isn't. If just to be absurd, in that respect. there was no need to add something to the \"Sacred 3\"'s setting. As a brief rererence to the \"Half-Life 2\"? Why there was a need to release that as DLC? Even as the very cheap DLC?\n\nI'd say, it's just ridiculous to sell it. However, if they added that into the base game, there would be a fat chance players wouldn't ever notice that idea, so it may have that kind of sence...\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review of the \"Sacred Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/225640]Review of the \"Sacred 2 Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/247950/]Review of the \"Sacred 3\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279110]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Malakhim Hero [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/261161]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orcland Story [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279111]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orc of Thrones [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279112]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Z4ngr13f Weapons Spirit [DLC]\"[/url] (you are here)\n[/code]","timestamp_created":1552081294,"timestamp_updated":1557599696,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608627021312713623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyKaL1OoCfsLNvAE="}
