    review: 'A review in five haiku by Cerulean


      discarded objects

      the genesis of new life

      pixels by Monet


      An invitation

      to make cosmos from chaos

      the crows are watching


      this is your refuge

      there is no competition

      joyful solitude


      Inhale the cool air

      before you click that mouse

      exhale a garden


      Am I a cloud,

      a gardener made of mist?

      I have all I need.
