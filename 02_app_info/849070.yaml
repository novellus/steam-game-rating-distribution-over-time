    review: "I actually enjoyed playing Black Home 1, even with some of the bugs that\
      \ others have encountered. \n\nUnfortunately, the bugs in this game render it\
      \ unplayable. I gave it 4 hours, but after failing to find a walkthrough (I\
      \ could not get past Level 3 of the prison to find the guaze), and dying constantly\
      \ because of lack of healing items (including no antidotes when all enemies\
      \ cast poison), healing spots, and ways to replenish MP, I'm finally giving\
      \ up. There's plenty more games in my backlog to play that aren't broken like\
      \ this. It's sad, because I was enjoying the story."
