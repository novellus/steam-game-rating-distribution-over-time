The author defenitly knew what he was doing, using subtle (and not so subtle) shifts in vocabulary depending on the current protagonist, and painting a vivid picture of the Cyberpunk world of Satellite Reign. I especially liked the chapter transitions.\n\nTook me around 3h 15min to read the 144 pages in one go. Since i'm a fast reader, but had to look up some english words (without internet in a physical dictionary!) i guess this cancels out, and you can expect three to three and a half hours of a read.\n\nSince i picked this up when criminally underpriced in a sale, i defenitly recomend this prequel novella.","timestamp_created":1552306216,"timestamp_updated":1552318311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584494113922119141","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pbXYtukCdtbpvAE="}
