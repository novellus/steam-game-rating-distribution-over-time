    review: "At half price, it's a steal. There are many items in here that turn the\
      \ game into super easy mode, but also some items that simply help with grinding\
      \ without unbalancing the game.\n\nTo clarify, the game is perfectly doable\
      \ at hardest difficulties without this DLC, even on the first play through,\
      \ and while this DLC will make it much simpler, it is by no means required.\n\
      \nFor helping with the grind, before beating the main game, I'd suggest double\
      \ grade & gald and max item expansion. Double XP & skill booster, as well as\
      \ the +HP/Levels will make the game feel less like a game and more like an interactive\
      \ story which may be unwelcome to those who still wish a degree of challenge.\
      \ \n\nDouble grade and gald just reduce the grind, rather than overpower you.\
      \ Double XP theoretically ought to do the same, but you're unlikely to reduce\
      \ battles to 50% like you'd think due to the various benefits of battle... thus,\
      \ very quickly you'll out-level the pace of the game. \n\nAnd, just to for assistance\
      \ of anyone reading, the less obvious items listed provide the following benefits.\n\
      \n[b]Skill Booster[/b], literally just halves the requirements for artes which\
      \ means you unlock things much sooner than you ought to. Again, in my opinion,\
      \ overpowering you compared to the pace of the game; but again, fine if you\
      \ are more concerned about story than any sort of minutely challenging gameplay\
      \ or perhaps find world encounters monotonous. \n\n[b]Max Item Expansion[/b]\
      \ Only increases the cap of consumables. I.e 30 life bottles instead of 15.\
      \ Not materials or ingredients which cap at 99.\n\n[b]Growth Enhancement[/b]\
      \ sets both give a selection of herbs that increase various stats Green provides\
      \ the basic ones you can find (in very limited quantities) from the start of\
      \ the game, and the red variant the upgraded versions you wouldn't normally\
      \ find until mid-game."
