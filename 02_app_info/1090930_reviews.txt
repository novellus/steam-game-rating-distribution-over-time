This is such an unbelievably fun concept that in my opinion at least, adds much more replayablity to a genre I really enjoy.\n    [*]Having so much control over the customization of my party is another feature I love seeing in an RPG that many RPGs often miss the boat when during implementation. I also really greatly approve of larger party sizes being more common in RPGs of this nature. To me, six party members feels like the bare minimum. I often have less fun in games where I am only allowed 4 or 5, even less character slots to fill for my party. In Endless RPG, we get [b][i]eight![/i][/b]\n    [*]Exploring each new world is incredibly satisfying and it's really fun seeing new enemy dens/forts/towers pop up and watching how the NPC towns interact with the new threat.\n    [*]I personally am a huge fan of any game that feels like the world in which it inhabits could continue on endlessly even if the player character(s) weren't a factor. This game makes you feel like an important piece of the world, but not a necessary component for its continued existence. Way too many games these days are designed around the idea of the player character(s) being the \"chosen one\" or what have you, which to me is just an excuse for poor writing or limited game design. You won't have that with Endless RPG!\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The \"fetch\" type quests are a bit boring after the first 5 or so times you do them. I would have liked to see more variety here, but at a certain point I found that I didn't really need to do too many of them before my party was fit enough to do more fun tasks on its own.\n    [*]I would have liked to see a much bigger world, but the ability to generate new worlds and easily transfer my party to those worlds is a nice substitute.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The Overview [/h1]\nFor me, it's easiest to judge how much joy I will get out of a game like this when I find myself constantly saying: \"If I was building a game like this, I would have done it exactly like this!\" many times throughout my time with the game. Endless RPG is a game that feels like many of its design elements were pulled straight from my subconscious and \"put to paper\" so to speak. There is so much here that [i]feels[/i] like a game I would design and play myself. Does this mean it's a great game that's fitting for every type of gamer? No. However, if you are the type of person who really enjoys world building or the concept of world building, really enjoys the idea of building your own party from the ground up and shaping them into a force to be reckoned with all the while interacting with a rather believable world, then I would say this is the kind of game for you.\n\nIt honestly has a great deal more replayability than I thought it would, which is why I held out on purchasing it for as long as I did. I didn't think the \"small\" maps would hold my interest for very long, but somewhere around the 10 - 15 hour point it really dawned on me just how much there is here to be enjoyed. Especially if you create multiple parties. The game is designed in such a way that if your first party gets stuck on your first world (on a quest you cannot beat, the enemies have gotten so powerful you couldn't keep up, etc.), you can simply create a second world and play on there until you feel comfortable going back to your first world. In my personal experience, my first party actually became kind of hindered by my own design choices, so I made a second party that ultimately became 3x more powerful than my first party, and I was able to go back and finish a lot of quests on the worlds I had become \"stuck on\" with my first party. There is a lot of flexibility in that way for the player, and I appreciate things like that.","timestamp_created":1609953962,"timestamp_updated":1609953962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgf2u7PYCea2HwQI="}
