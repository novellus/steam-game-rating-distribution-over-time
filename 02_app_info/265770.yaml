      <br />\r\nWe wanted to make something that we ourselves would like to play -\
      \ a game chock-full of what\u2019s cool about spaceships shooting each other\

      \ with both a light-hearted gameplay that is hard to find today and deep tactical\
      \ potential that allows for sophisticated approach to team play.<br />\r\nSo\
      \ we made Cannons Lasers Rockets - a fast-paced, bright and colorful space arcade\
      \ equally enjoyable for hardcore and casual gamers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn our\

      \ />\r\nA videogame spaceship is usually not an easy ride - three-dimensional\
