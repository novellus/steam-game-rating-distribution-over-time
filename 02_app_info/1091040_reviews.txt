Because the options are not many Although it wasn't what I was hoping for and was looking for, it was enough to make me feel some fun. The game does not take long to complete, if you understand the game system well it may take time. Two to three hours to complete At the end of the game, there was nothing more than going back to unlocking CG H, at least I think the heroine skin will be unlocked, used for playing around two or three. To change the atmosphere Or perhaps for a little game quest after the story, for example Rescue young women who are raped and assassinated (if updates are available).\nCG is beautiful, it looks good, but unfortunately some of the characters don't have CG, making the heroine seem like talking to the air. But that's not a problem Also, Repeated use of supporting character CG, just changing colors confused me the character a little. It doesn't seem important but I pick up the details.\nThe game does not have a system in the world. Most of the content is carried out with the characters without the opportunity to return to their original location or to wander the world. So if you stay in a village or some place and can walk to training Should be done to keep the level and should save the game first every time.\nThe character's voice sounds good but only Only heroine\nAll in all, this looks like a game with more Ninja warrior content than Ninja assassin (much more) 7.5 / 10, the price is reasonable.\nI am waiting to see the sequel if the Dev does it or DLC.","timestamp_created":1605634671,"timestamp_updated":1605685433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4quqT7fUCe+/8rgI="}
