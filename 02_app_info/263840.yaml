    review: I've tried to create  7 or 8 game where I have 1 major league team, and
      1 minor league team, with curent roster, and scouting. Each time I've end up
      with something totally different. Now I have 7 or 8 saved games I can't delete.
      :(  I end up been pissed off each time and quit.
