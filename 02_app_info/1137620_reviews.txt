The game was enjoyable.  \nYou basically just click the screen and get to make some choices of what to say along the way.  The art was decent.  \n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes.\nWhat would I rate this game?  3/5.","timestamp_created":1593371516,"timestamp_updated":1593371516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxvuV/vICdYOPkQI="}
