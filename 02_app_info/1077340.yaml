    about_the_game: 'Think of <strong>Downtown Drift</strong> as pac-man, but as a
      first-person racing game. You need to try and score as many points as possible
      by drifting while police is chasing you down. Each drift gives you a certain
      amount of points and also increases your multiplier. The higher the multiplier,
      the more points you get for each drift. However there is a catch: you only have
      limited health and you take damage everytime you crash, so watch how you move!<h2
