    review: 'Okay, ''strange and powerful new effects'' is overselling it. The abilities
      aren''t new mechanics, they''re the same abilities you might expect from any
      of the base factions, except now you get more of them for a single card. The
      ability to be triggerd by either faction, or to trigger either faction, is their
      main draw.


      Personally, I think this is the weaker of the two dual-faction expansions, but
      a worthy inclusion.


      Since WWG doesn''t like to tell you exactly what you''re buying, please see
      below:


      Explanation: C=Combat, HP=Authority, T=Trade


      Trade Fed + Star Empire = Alliance

      Ship - Alliance Transport: 2-cost; 2T; yellow faction, opponent Discard 1; blue
      faction, +4HP <- [i]my favorite ship from this expansion[/i]

      Base - Embassy Base: 8-cost; Draw 2 cards, discard a card. 6 hit points. <-
      There are much better 8-cost cards out there.


      Star Empire + Blob = Union

      Ship - Trade Star: 1-cost; 2T; scrap +2C. <- it''s a cheap explorer with 2 factions.
      Kind of underwhelming.

      Base - Union Stronghold: 5-cost; 3C; blob faction, scrap 1 in trade row; yellow
      faction, opponent Discard 1. <- meh


      Trade Fed + Machine Cult = Coalition

      Ship: Coalition Messenger: 3-cost; 2T; faction (either), Choose a card of cost
      5 or less from your discard pile and put it on top of your deck. <- some interesting
      late-game plays can come from this one.

      Outpost Base: Lookout Post: 7-cost; draw a card. 6 hit points <- It''s merely
      okay.


      Blob + Machine Cult = Unity

      Ship - Blob Bot: 3-cost; 5C; blob faction, +2T; red faction, scrap 1 <- Meh.

      Base - Exchange Point: 6-cost; 2C; faction (either), scrap 1. 7 hit points.
      <- Actually pretty good if you can get the scrapping going consistently. The
      7HP makes it hard to kill in early to mid game.
