Wow this really looks like somebody threw this together in five minutes in unity. well it's an experience so graphics need not be good. so hmm is it really broken... hmm. one more try with the cubes.. they turn a colour. ah. I gotta line them up perfecly on the squaires. oh no this is not looking good. \nstart game bring cubey home. ah. lets do that. Hmm if i turn i can't see cubey so lets keep standing still and look on cubey from so far away that I need to turn up antialiasing to be able to spot him moving in the distance. \nah. so I  can't really see where cubey is going before he is landing in the fire pit.
