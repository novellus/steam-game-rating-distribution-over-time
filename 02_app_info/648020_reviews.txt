The game generally allowed for that.  As others have noted, it's a relatively short game which is both good and bad.  It make subsequent playthroughs to try different strategies less onerous but, at the same time, makes it difficult to develop a lot of depth in either the story or the characters within that story.\n\nOverall, for the price, it isn't bad.  Just don't expect it to be the best CYOA novel out there.","timestamp_created":1603371265,"timestamp_updated":1603371265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vv2XqPUCcre1qQI="}
