Ofc they are now dated (graphic and interface) but still give a lot of enjoyment for people who can accept this fact. Yeah, if you checking this game you probably played those games as a child and want to feel those memories of childchood again. You may be also the one who just like to see how games progressed in years. When you laid back and relax and play those games just for fun they will give you a lot of it. Recommended.","timestamp_created":1609373461,"timestamp_updated":1609373461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oMWI2/YCcu74vgI="}
