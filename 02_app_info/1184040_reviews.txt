This game is apparently the 2nd in a trilogy, but my playing it 1st by mistake didn't detract from my experience.\n\nThe art and presentation of the game are both really, really cool and I'm glad I was able to stick with it through to the end. It had this almost body horror, mystical fever dream kind of feeling to it. I highly recommend giving it a go if that sounds interesting to you.\n\nIt doesn't seem to have a save feature though, so I left the game open between play sessions. It probably took me around 5-6 hours to complete it.","timestamp_created":1607480658,"timestamp_updated":1607480658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhYnUovYCccCnuAI="}
