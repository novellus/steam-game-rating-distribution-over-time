I'm looking forward to things to come\n+ the lightsaber felt great!\n+ blocking the energy bolts felt VERY real, not too easy\n\n- very little world interaction, the 'press the buttons to fix the ship' hook was very egh\n- short, 'feel the saber and over' experience\n- the room-scale requirement is larger than it needs to be, and a bit larger than most other games, forcing some recalibration on my end\n\nA down vote might be a bit harsh.. i would rather have a neutral vote, an up vote is too strong as well.","timestamp_created":1488327130,"timestamp_updated":1488327748,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470707088708877563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmuXPw9oCdfmycw=="}
