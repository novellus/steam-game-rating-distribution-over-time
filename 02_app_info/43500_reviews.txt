Instead of being presented with a god-view and a bunch of menus, you have to walk between rooms and then click on a tiny smartphone as your only real interface. \n\nThe game concept isn't bad but the gameplay here is needlessly convoluted.   Having the game menus appear on tiny little smartphone devices (as you can see in the screenshots) is painful, especially if you have a high resolution monitor.  These guys did not learn about UI scaling when they were in community college. \n\nGiven the game is a full 10 years old now and still riddled with bugs and an unwieldy and unfun interface, there's no excuse for them to charge $10 USD for this one.  I'd give this one a miss, plenty of other tycoon games on Steam represent much better value for money.","timestamp_created":1603454185,"timestamp_updated":1603454185,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.169535547494888306","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qXUqvUCc5bMqQI="}
