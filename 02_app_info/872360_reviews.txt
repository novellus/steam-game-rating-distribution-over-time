The graphic pull you in, imersing you fully into the lore and story. You can feel the pull of the story with all its twist and turns. You fear what will happen to the city if the fruit happens to hit it. The tension as you move the hoop left and right, invergrate you. It complex control system is hard to master but once you get it under your belt its smooth and fluid to the extent that i forget im even playing a game. Over all i would recomend this game to anyone who favors world building, story, action, love, drama, and dispair. It fun for the Whole family.","timestamp_created":1544251145,"timestamp_updated":1544251145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580419540405273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ss+ixucCcdTetAE="}
