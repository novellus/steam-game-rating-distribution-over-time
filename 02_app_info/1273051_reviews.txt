Her maid attire looks great and fits the setting rather than the World's Odyssey avatar they throw at you. The new dialogue is the best part of this dlc and should have been advertised. Talking to Shina is funny and enjoyable. She even has new updated victories with the girls! Worth the buy. Though it should have been in the main game..","timestamp_created":1604632036,"timestamp_updated":1604632036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqrjhzfUCeMTMrAI="}
