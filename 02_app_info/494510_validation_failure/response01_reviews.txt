Most people point that out for reviews on every other DoA5 DLC page. The devs couldn't be fucked to do it and for me it doesn't effect the game. It can't be helped.\nHowever this DLC reflects many things that are wrong with how the game and its fans are being treated.\nLets look at the price first. Typically I think its dumb to make a big deal about the price for games or extra content as those will go down pretty fast via a sale or something just months later as is the current trend. However this DLC which was up for only a year never got a discount or sale. It remained the same price the entire one year it was available. You would think with the past Steam summer sale they might throw us a bone since they know it's going to be removed but nope.\nThis leads us to the next thing to examine, the actual price. Here in the US it ran for $40. Putting that into perspective the game itself before turning over to the free to play model was either the same or lower the price depending on how you purchased it. Now I can't really comment on the amount of effort it took to make these costumes, yes they all look nice and accurate to the material they're supposed to represent but objectively they're just brown jackets with logos for a majority of the cast. Putting this also into perspective without making some arbitrary system of what takes more effort, I will say DLC costumes packs with more varied costumes cost less than this one did and they have also received discounts making them even cheaper than this. So where exactly does this price come from? Certain people at this game company trying \nto milk Dead or Alive and Attack on Titan fans for as much money as they can.\nNow to put the cherry on top in their fine print: \"*The Attack on Titan stage shown in the screenshots cannot be used in this version of the game.\" Well isn't that great? Just another reminder on how little they care about the PC community that they couldn't port over what was essentially a reskinned version of another stage already in the game. I think them having screenshots of content not actually in this game is also a violation, not sure if that new Steam rule applies retroactively. Seeing as how this DLC is getting removed though, I guess nothing can be done about that at this point.\n\nSo for any devs wishing to make bank just know you need to have a crossover DLC with a hot property, mark it up for high of price as possible and then announce later that you're removing it so you get a surge more sales towards the end.\n\nSo I guess my final rating is for the DLC itself: Brown Jacket/10\nRating for pricing and practice behind this: *You must have the latest update installed in order to view this rating.","timestamp_created":1500338270,"timestamp_updated":1500338270,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464593976736068726","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw86XIqd0CdOCfgAE="}
