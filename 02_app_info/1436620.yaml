    about_the_game: 'Agony Online is the world''s first ever mix of MMORPG &amp; Battle
      Royale on a monumental scale that is made by independent developers that want
      to play their own game. Players can choose to join Battle Royale, or continue
      playing the Horror MMORPG. The massive 30 Mile / 48 Kilometer apocalyptic island
      explodes and burns with hell fire killing 100s of players not quick enough to
      make it to the safe zones.<h2 class="bb_tag">Discord:</h2>Join our Discord and

      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >https://discord.gg/8sZdvQD</a><h2 class="bb_tag">Story:</h2>Hell
      has risen and taken over the world, the last of humanity is in hiding. Your
      family was killed and your child was tortured to death by demons. Satan then
      cursed you with immortality so you can never leave this Hell on Earth. You kill
      yourself, but after dying, you always wake up somewhere else. You find out that
      you''re a part of a prophecy to team up with others like you to destroy Satan
      in a final battle to save the world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Movement Information:</h2>In
      Agony Online you will be able to point-click or simply use the WASD keys to
      move as well.<h2 class="bb_tag">Battle Royale Information:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>All
      players that register for Battle Royale are teleported randomly across to a
      40km/25mile size Battle Island which slowly explodes and bursts into fire as
      the island becomes unstable. </li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>To get weapons
      and armor, players kill zombies which drop randomized gear.  Alternately, treasure
      boxes spawn which you can also obtain random  weapons/armor. </li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>To
      get higher grade gear, you can either hunt players and steal their loot, or
      kill bosses which also spawn.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">MMORPG Information:</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Upon launch, level cap will be 30, then as the game progresses
      with more players, we will raise the level cap as we release more content. PvP
      will be heavy in this game; guilds can declare war and battle anywhere in the
      open world. With our World War system, every weekend, all guilds fight over
      an area in a &quot;King of The Hill&quot; style battle. The winning guild that
      holds the position wins, that guild controls the tax rate across the world and
      collects all the tax money. </li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Main Story Line:
      Your body was dragged from a fire into town, you woke up the next day and went
      back to search for your family, you found your  daughter''s body torn apart
      with your wife still dying. She points to a  hill outside before she dies. Satan
      murdered your family, when you kill  one of his possessed vessels, he laughs
      and curses you with eternal life - now you wake up somewhere every time you
      die, never escaping Hell on Earth to be with your dead family. Join others like
      you to get stronger together and save the world that Satan has taken over in
      a final battle. </li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Side Quests: Story lines
      can be very boring, we smash the skip button the moment we see it. In AO, we
      made quests full of memes and jokes.<br></li><li>Maybe a crazy homeless guy
      with crazy eyes wants to order a pizza with gumballs on it and him and his pet
      cat discuss bitcoin investments. </li></ul>'
