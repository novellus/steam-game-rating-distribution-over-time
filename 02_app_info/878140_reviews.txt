Sounds like a great concept to me. You cast spells that change the population of different animals which influences the food chain, if one of the animals die you loose the game. There is just one little problem. I beat the game in 10 minutes and I was not even trying to do so. You should have seen the stare on my face. I am not trying to be a jerk here, but if your resource management game can be completed in 10 minutes by someone who never played the game - the decision making aspect of your game has failed.\n\nThe game has 3 different modes such as story, standard and endless. Unfortunately, all of those modes kind of amount to the same thing because there is nothing to look forward to, not even miserable achievement for surviving. Maybe if they had a couple different maps with different seasons, that would be good. Perhaps new maps could add more animals. But as it stands Witch of the Woods has absolutely nothing to accomplish beyond the 5 - 20 minutes that it takes to beat it. I am not angry because I wasted money, I am angry because the developers wasted a good concept. Can we get an actual reason to keep playing the game? \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ nice aesthetic\n+ promising concept\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- completed in 10 minutes...\n- nothing to work toward\n- the decision making, should probably be more complex?\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 4/10 [/b]\n\nHey the concept is great and the gameplay has potential. At the very least we should get some achievements to grind the endless mode for a few hours. Ideally though, I would like to see 3 more maps for each season with a few new animals, then it might be a decent game. Like you got to give the player something to work toward, your decision making game needs to give some resistance. I beat it in 10 minutes, there is nothing to do here. Yea it looked pretty, not much of a decision making game though.\n\n[code]If the game shows some improvements, I will consider removing this review.
