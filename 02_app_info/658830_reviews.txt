And bugs and quality of life issues are to be expected with such new  games in the first place. So I really dont fault the devs for them.\n\nThis game is fundementally about discovery with survival elements so if it seems to you that you would like a game about experimentation and investigation then you may well like this game.  If you dont like the idea of science and magic fusing then it may not be for you.","timestamp_created":1600484284,"timestamp_updated":1609380317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49Nii2/YCfoHYogI="}
