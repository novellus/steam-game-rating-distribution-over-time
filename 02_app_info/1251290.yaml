    review: 'Yet another trash asset flip from a developer flipping out the same trash
      game with different maps and assets and using many different alternate developer
      names, which is against the Steam developer agreement by the way.


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU2NIoMO9lE


      In my reasoning, this game like all the others I''ve already covered, deserves
      to burn in the depths of hell and the developer should be banned from Steam
      forever.


      Imagine your local grocery store selling stinky fresh dog crap on its shelves
      for just 99 cents... that is essentially what this game is and why it''s allowed
      to be sold here on Steam shows how little quality control this platform has
      for games to exist here.


      NOT RECOMMENDED.  If someone offers you $20 to play this, tell them "NO!" because
      not only is it a terrible game but it also will cause your computer to suffer
      severe memory leaks long after you quit and uninstall it.  (Obviously a computer
      reboot will fix it but why pay any amount of money for crap this bad?)'
