I may play it a little more but even at 3$ its a 1 player game a time spender I shouldnt be frustrated by the mechanics .. im ok with being aggravated by the difficulty .. but on something as easy as a one button hot potato game and thats what this is .. even on sale this is a waste of money .. maybe they made it this way because playing it with a bigger hit box would be to easy .. speed up the water .. speed up the guys or the game ... grade 3 / 10","timestamp_created":1578268745,"timestamp_updated":1578268745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436690568923950195","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40ruJvO8CdfqW6gE="}
