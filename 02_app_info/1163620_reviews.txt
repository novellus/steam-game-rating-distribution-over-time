They all fit the same theme, but the assets all have art styles just different enough to throw me off.\n\nThe game drops you in with little to no explanation of what's going on, in the \"customizeable hub world\" that's really just one area with a few unlockable decorations.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely simple, more of a minigame than a proper game. It is, admittedly, somewhat challenging, but it's certainly not something you'll feel inclined to come back to.\n\nI'd say this game isn't worth your time when taken at face value, but there may be some value in it for a beginning game developer who wishes to learn from it.\n\nAnd to the devs of this game specifically... Don't let my review get you down. You've successfully published a working game to steam, so that's a big milestone. For your next game, however, you should take a lot more time thinking of an idea, and polishing it. I'd say a good game will take a couple years to make. You'll probably have to get a day job to support yourself during the process.","timestamp_created":1605186550,"timestamp_updated":1605186550,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj9+k3vUCecn2rQI="}
