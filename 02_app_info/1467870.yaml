    review: "Mystery Case Files: Cross Fade is the newest game to bring back the Master\
      \ Detective in a series that spins 22 games, not counting a small handful of\
      \ spin-offs.  Does it measure up?  Let's find out.\n\nStory/Plot:\nCross Fade\
      \ starts on the cliffhanger the previous game, The Harbinger, ended on.  The\
      \ Master Detective wakes up and finds out key moments of their past have been\
      \ altered.  In order to save their life, and time itself, the detective must\
      \ fix what went wrong, while thwarting some of their previous villains while\
      \ once more.\n\nAlmost from the start, this is also when the story goes downhill.\
      \  Almost every 'novel' idea this game purports to do has already been done\
      \ in the series, often much better.  Disruptions to the timeline?  Done that.\
      \  Facing off against old villains?  Been there.  It can be nice to revisit\
      \ older games, but MCF relies on it to a criminal degree by this point.\n\n\
      This game's story has two big problems that I've railed on in previous reviews.\
      \  The first is the series really needs to decide what it wants.  Originally,\
      \ the Master Detective was a faceless protagonist, but the fourth game revealed\
      \ the detective to be female from the backside including hairstyle, and a couple\
      \ spoken lines.  Later games allowed the player to choose a gender, or force\
      \ it to be male.  This game goes the male route; frankly if they made the detective\
      \ a genderfluid shapeshifter, that at least would clear that up even if I prefer\
      \ the female detective.\n\nThe second is the retcons and plotholes.  These have\
      \ gotten ridiculous, and especially noticeable to long time followers of the\
      \ series.  Changing studios certainly hasn't helped; if anything, in some matters\
      \ it made things worse.  \n\nCentral to a lot of these is the Delimar bloodline,\
      \ and seriously, give it a rest.  In the early days, I used to like their appearance,\
      \ but more often than not they are a guest star if not the central villain.\
      \  Any appeal is long lost, especially when it muddies the waters even further.\
      \  I mean, when Dr. Who is more consistent with their lore, then something is\
      \ off the rails.\n\nBeating the game unlocks a bonus chapter which gives you\
      \ further details from a different character in the story as well as gives some\
      \ vague hints what the next game in the series may hold. \n\nVisuals: \nI personally\
      \ found the visuals in Crossfade rather lacking.  While they are serviceable\
      \ for the story, nothing really stands out.  Of course, any paranormal story\
      \ is going to rely on things being dark, but you could at least rely on a few\
      \ backgrounds to really stand out in previous games.  None of that is here.\
      \  I wouldn't be surprised if the studio was only allowed a small budget, and\
      \ would explain the visuals.  \n\nGameplay \nI think as you can tell, I'm pretty\
      \ down on this game.  If there is any positive thing to it, it can be in Gameplay.\
      \  As a Hidden Object Game, Crossfade has elements of point-and-click, hidden-object\
      \ screens, and minigames.  \n\nThe point-and-click is just that.  If you find\
      \ an item, you put it in your inventory, then bring it out when you come across\
      \ an appropriate situation such as bringing scissors to cut a rope.  Occasionally,\
      \ you may have to fix an item in your inventory screen before using it, which\
      \ at least adds one more layer to the game.\n\nHidden Object Screens are simply\
      \ that; static screens where you have to find a number of items from a list\
      \ at the bottom.  Most items can be found immediately, and disappear with a\
      \ click, while others may have one or two steps to reveal them...such as breaking\
      \ a mirror to find something hiding behind it.  Weirdly, I think Crossfade has\
      \ the fewest number of Hidden Object Screens I've seen in the series yet.  \n\
      \nFinally there are the minigames.  These are a variety of small games which\
      \ vary up the gameplay.  Some are logic puzzles, while others rely on you to\
      \ click your mouse button in quick succession.  The difficulty of these vary,\
      \ but veteran players of HoGs will recognize them and be able to get through\
      \ them fairly quicly.  \n\nFinally, if you do get stuck, the game does give\
      \ you hints to find hidden items, or to skip puzzles after a bit of time passes.\n\
      \nSound/Music: \nThough there isn't many spoken parts, the game does have voice\
      \ acting.  Given how little there actually is, you would think the quality would\
      \ at least be decent...but most of it is subpar.  There were a couple of times\
      \ I thought they must have pulled someone off the street and given them a few\
      \ quarters before sending them on their way.\n\nThere is also background music,\
      \ and it is competent, but certainly nothing stands out.  I've seen games use\
      \ royalty free music which was more memorable.\n\nDifficulty: \nAs with most\
      \ recent Big Fish Games, you can choose your difficulty in Crossfade.  There\
      \ is the normal 'Hard-Medium-Easy' settings as well as personally customizing\
      \ it.  You can choose to shorten the amount of time it takes to refresh hints,\
      \ or to skip puzzles, etc.  In this regard, I have to give it a thumbs up.\n\
      \nExtras/Achievements: \nDoes this game have any extras?  As mentioned, beating\
      \ the main game unlocks a bonus chapter.  Additionally, there are two collectibles;\
      \ Clues and Puzzle Pieces.  Finding all of these gives a minor bonus at the\
      \ end; finding all the puzzle pieces gives you a bonus wallpaper if you wish\
      \ to use it.  Additionally, as this is the collector's edition, you have access\
      \ to the music, minigames, etc. in a separate menu.\n\nThis game  has in-game\
      \ achievements as you cross certain thresholds like finishing a chapter.  Unfortunately,\
      \ there are no Steam achievements for those interest in such things.\n\nRecommendation:\n\
      So would I recommend this game?  As you can guess, the answer is no.  Big Fish\
      \ Games could remove this entry, and no one would even notice.  If anything,\
      \ it is just another indication of how far the series has gone downhill.  At\
      \ this point, the only thing that might help is to do a hard reboot on the series.\
      \  So why do I play it?  For some reason I'm now more interested to see how\
      \ the series fails than anything else.\n\nIs there any point I could recommend\
      \ it?  I guess if a person wants to waste a few hours, and wants to take a stab\
      \ at some of the minigames.  Even then, only get it on discount if you have\
      \ money you want to burn.  Otherwise, I'd try something else.  Big Fish Games\
      \ actually released other new games that I would recommend over this mess."
