      I must Thank You for your review and also say that it was pleasantly critical,
      to the point and especially devoid of insults -- I wish that I could say that
      all reviews display the tact that yours does, but unfortunately I cannot, so
      this too is appreciated!


      You cleverly touched on many things that we are aware of and some that we have
      already rectified in internal builds and are forthcoming fixes in the next patch!


      We appreciate you sticking with us a great deal to see just where this thing
      goes and we also hope to sometime earn your changing your review to ''recommended''
      at a future time!


      Thank You, again!

    review: 'Rule No. 1 is a game that is frustrating because it has the bones of
      a game that could be really fun and engaging but misses the mark. is it worth
      5 USD? Yes. But in it''s current state I''d like to see it improved before I
      put more time into it.


      Some things that stuck in my craw:

      [list]

      [*] The game booted into 1920x1200. My monitor is 1920x1080. However, the game
      does not permit you to change the resolution if it is running in fullscreen.

      [*] The game doesn''t have extra keybinding slots for keys, it''s one only,
      so if you want to add an alternative, you replace the original, which mostly
      is fine, but I wish you could have extras to help with when you knee-jerk based
      on muscle memory.

      [*] For a game where you are being assaulted on all sides but ghastly floating
      polygons, the game does not really provide any kind of situational awareness.
      I know that the  things don''t really touch the ground, but if something is
      directly behind you, you don''t hear it, there is no indication that it exists,
      it''s just there, and this is super difficult to work with in a game like this.

      [*] The amount of ammo that guns can hold is very small, but I honestly question
      reloading as a mechanic at all. For a game like this, if you think of like say
      a Geometry Wars or a Super Stardust HD, you have different weapon types for
      different purposes, but you don''t ''reload'' and for a game like this, I just
      question why this has been placed into the mix. It feels like playing something
      like Space Invaders where you have to stop and reload. At the very least, providing
      an option for auto-reload once empty would be very, very appreciated!

      [*] Similar to above, there is a key to collect all drops. It seems to be AoE
      and grab anything on the ground. In a game like this again, make pickups automatics.
      I don''t see why this is an extra step.

      [*] When you die, you get a "Continue?" screen...... there is no option other
      than continue. Nothing you press does anything other than start over again,
      and then you can exist from the menu. This is kind of superfluous, I don''t
      see why it exists if it can''t be used for any purpose other than continuing.

      [*] The physics can be irritating sometimes. The special boxes for example fly
      straight up into the air when you shoot them with the shotgun... I really want
      the surprises inside and not for it to fly straight up into orbit when I shoot
      it.

      [*] I love the different game references. "I live again!" Don''t get me wrong,
      this is mostly critical, but the game has charm and I am not requesting a refund
      because I wanna see this continue to grow. The music options are also dope and
      very much appreciated.
