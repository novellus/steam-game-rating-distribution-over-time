Puzzles, hidden chests and strategic combat gives this game a good combination of fun. Movement is a bit clunky as you follow a grid but you easily adapt to it. Levels of difficulty keep you on your feet and rethink strategy when you are defeated. Good amount of loot and levelling up characters gives you a good amount of options on how you want the to support the party.","timestamp_created":1609977608,"timestamp_updated":1609977608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9JaJ7fYCfb2SwQI="}
