First of all, I would like to mention that this is a film that wasn't made by a big name studio. That doesn't mean it's bad though. I feel like the story and concept had and still has an amazing amount of potential. However this is a film that was made on a low budget, and it suffers from that sadly. I will say that there is a certain charm about films made on low budgets. For instance, in the beginning, the movie you are greeted with the main character and a nice long stargaze followed by a car ride. The reason that this is so amazing here vs big name productions is the camera position. Because there is a cameraman instead of some drone with a camera attached to the thing it just feels more human. This combined with the music in the background allows the piece to bleed with emotion and feelings I can only get when stargazing myself. That charm is what made this movie for me. As you would expect this fades away as the film goes on, however, the fact that it's there at all is an amazing thing that big names like Disney can't even do. Overall, a neat little film worth checking out, just don't expect that much.","timestamp_created":1507071595,"timestamp_updated":1507071595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n/Kd8t4CedChhwE="}
