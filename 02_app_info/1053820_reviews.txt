The different classes are ok. Story starts suddenly and moves on a rail. The citys feel lustless and empty. \nMap-transition is annoying (loading times) and input on the battle screen is slow. Skills are listed and you have to scroll to find a skill you want to use. To leave the menu you have to use the back button 2 times, this is annoying.\n\nThis game should be fun to play, but the annoying Input and the map transition kills it for me.\n","timestamp_created":1574970963,"timestamp_updated":1574970963,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w7bl2e4CfKuG3wE="}
