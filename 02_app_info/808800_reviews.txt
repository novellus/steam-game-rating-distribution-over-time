I persevered though, and after an hour or so I think I understood enough that I was enjoying what I was doing, even if I wasn't sure exactly what that was, or if it had any of the effects I thought it might.\n\nI enjoyed the roguelike aspects very much, the campaign links I pursued so far were simple but enjoyable, and I really wanted to find something I could pick up for an hour at lunch and feel like I'd done something in, even if that was just a couple of upgrades and clearing a sector.  \n\nSorry to not have any analysis, but for what it's worth, I've been having fun with it!","timestamp_created":1602183456,"timestamp_updated":1602183456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0OzkhPUCf9PVpgI="}
