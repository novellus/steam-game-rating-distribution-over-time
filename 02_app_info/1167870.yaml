    review: "Ok. \xA37.19 is a big ask for two tables (not sure what it is in dollars?\
      \ Probably around $8.99?). So these tables have to be good.\n\nI'm happy to\
      \ say that they are absolutely astonishing. They are absolute classics, and\
      \ if you spent any time in arcades back in the 90's you probably played one\
      \ of these.\nLet's break them down.\n\nCreature From The Black Lagoon:\nSuper\
      \ interesting table. The ramps are really striking that absolutely envelop the\
      \ playfield. The main objective for big points is to spell out \"film\" by completing\
      \ various targets across the table. (Spell \"love\", hit the standups in the\
      \ middle to open the snack bar, spell \"paid\" by hitting the upper roll over\
      \ targets near the bumpers, and shooting the \"slide\" ramp on the right) This\
      \ will allow you to lock one of your balls and initiate a 2 ball multiball.\
      \ 2 balls? I hear you say, is that all? Man, it's one of the hardest multiballs\
      \ ever that has you searching for a damsel all over the playfield, and hitting\
      \ the snack bar. The amount of juggling involved is tough, and you can go for\
      \ riskier shots by hitting the film ramp on the left to build up a multiplier,\
      \ that essentially permanently doubles your jackpot. Some of the scores you\
      \ can get by hitting the super jackpots are absolutely absurd. \nExcellent table\
      \ that has me coming back time and time again to try and keep in the top 10\
      \ spot. It's quality.\n\nMonster Bash:\nOh man is this table amazing. The most\
      \ impressive thing about it is how everyone has their own strategy and approach.\
      \ Personally, I like to try and light up everything to the point where it's\
      \ one off activating, then cuing them all off one by one and locking them into\
      \ frankenstein multiball. I've only ever managed to get all of them into frankenstein\
      \ once, and it was intense. With some decent skill, you can keep multiball going\
      \ for a really long time leading to huge points. Great music, great theme, great\
      \ gameplay.\n\nI genuinely believe this to be one of the best packs Zen has\
      \ released. If not the best williams pack. It's just such a shame they couldn't\
      \ have lumped in one more table (Addams Family or Twilight Zone would have been\
      \ right at home with these two.) But alas, here we are. \n\nIt's a lot of money\
      \ for these two, but I guarantee if you saw these in an arcade you'd spend double\
      \ on them anyway, so who cares? Go for it and own them forever in all of their\
      \ glory!"
