It's music-based in that as you go through the level, the music gets more complex, but for the most part it's just a platformer. There is no combat or death - if you fall off the level you will be reset to your last point. There are 6 levels in every world, and 4 worlds, making a total of 24 levels [spoiler]plus one secret level you get for rescuing all the parrots[/spoiler]. \n\nFor a small team working on what appears to be a passion project, I'd say Newt One is outstanding. The concept is sound, the controls are decent - very slide-y and float-y - and the world is unique and colourful. Playing this makes me wish they had a few extra hands and funds to really polish it and push it from an interesting project to a fantastic game. As it stands, Newt One does have a few minor glitches here and there, the graphics are simple and the cutscenes are essentially a slideshow with meh text boxes. The grand majority of the characters actually have no hit boxes - this includes [spoiler]Curno, the Parrot King, and all three of the Elders[/spoiler]. \n\nBut for all its faults, I can't criticize Newt One's gameplay, art style or story - what I'd call the main components of any good game. The gameplay is satisfying with several achievements attached to each level for replayability. The art style is cute, cheerful and sweet, and sticks to the theme regardless of which world you're in. The music is nice - key in a music themed game like this one - and the story, while simple and too young for most players on Steam, is cute and wholesome. With animated cutscenes and a bit of rearranging, it would remind me a lot of the sorts of stories you'd find in Kirby, which I believe is what they were aiming for. I'd say it has about 3-6 hours of mindless fun to offer.\n\nOverall while Newt One is unpolished, I'd call it a little gem. It's short and sweet and while unpolished, I enjoyed playing it.","timestamp_created":1609553559,"timestamp_updated":1609553559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ce34PYCfP/KvwI="}
