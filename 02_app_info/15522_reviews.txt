I love it to death and i got this pack expecting to have some fun with a good challenge, instead what i got was unfair punishment. Cruel and un-diserved punishment. The game is all ready picky with points to get above a freaking 2 stars, and to be honest, i didn't find it as fun as i expected. Could i edit some files and maybe some registry to get these levels? Eh probably, I dont know if i suck or if i just cant stand how much points are taken away when you die and get rewound to a checkpoint. Oh, and i cant get past the first level, you know how i said \"The game is picky with points?\" Well, i can get 4 and 5 stars on the Summer level almost every time, but i cant even get a 3 star on the first level where it requires 4 stars to get past the 1st level, why not make it use teeth? Maybe make the cap at 3 stars? I dunno. But i struggle to recommend this one because its at Mario 2 levels of cruelty. And yes, i know its meant to be hard, but atleast put this one with For The Awesome's DLC (which was epic) If your just a new player, a okay/good player then i cant recommend this one, however if your a veteran like me and apparently cant do these levels, also dont buy it. Unless your a die hard fan who wants a massive challenge, whipping out the 5 stars on every level while kicking so much butt, then i could recommend this one, but just stay with For The Awesome.","timestamp_created":1570150907,"timestamp_updated":1570150907,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x6+Syu0Cfca70wE="}
