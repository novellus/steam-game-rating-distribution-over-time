I've been a massive fan of this genre, so it's great to see it make a comeback.\n\nThe Eye of Borrack is a classic fantasy text based game, with some great humour, a powerful parser, challenging puzzles and some lovely images. It really reminded me of the old school games, especially the works of such greats as Magnetic Scrolls and level 9, which in my book is a very good thing.\n\nOverall a great, fun game, and worth anyone's time .\n","timestamp_created":1606125929,"timestamp_updated":1606125929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4opik+vUCdeuEsAI="}
