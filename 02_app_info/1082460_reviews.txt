There’s not the excessive poop jokes every two seconds and it uses the theme rather well for the story.\n\nIf there is a complaint I would have it’s that the map is not very clear.  Eventually you can work out where you are on it but I do feel it would benefit from having an indicator of your location.  Plus I do reckon it would be good if there was an item that helped you explore better, similar at least in idea to the scan visor from Super Metroid or the stone of agony from Ocarina of time.\n\nIt may be abit rough, not win awards or be the most amazing game you’ll ever see, but I definitely think it‘s definitely worth the price.  I got hours of fun and playtime out of it and most of my struggles I found were from me trying to get before I was ready.","timestamp_created":1586884571,"timestamp_updated":1586884571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524714827537536621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4953svPECf/bhgAI="}
