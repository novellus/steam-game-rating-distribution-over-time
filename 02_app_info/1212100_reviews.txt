We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary game from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the game and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine game making is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. I realize, not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now game making at SokPop, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest creator in the industry.","timestamp_created":1609784565,"timestamp_updated":1609784565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40OOo5/YCedS7wAI="}
