I can't even say it's a game. It's more like a composing software. I gave this recommendation because the core idea of this game is really good. But you really need to focus on the differences between a GAME and a SOFTWARE. A good simulation game means you can play even you don't know any knowledge about the simulated theme. Hope you can do better on your next \"game.\"","timestamp_created":1522028280,"timestamp_updated":1522028280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613109469413757324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjI/9r+ICer7OnAE="}
