      puzzle board game freely inspired by the Mahjong Solitaire. Play Solo or against
      players from all over the world with Online and Local Pass &amp; Play modes!<br><br>In
      Dragon Castle: The Board Game, you will pick tiles from the central castle to

      points, if at the cost of limiting your building options! You may also take
      advantage of the spirits and their game-changing powers to manipulate the board...

      I love the art style and themes of the art and music. Planning to buy a physical
      copy of the actual board game soon as well!
