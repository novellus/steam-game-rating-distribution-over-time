    review: "Date of completion: August 1, 2020.\n\nReview: Another boring chore off\
      \ my list; the graphics, background images and music are okay, the gameplay's\
      \ the same as all the holiday themed aMAZE games. Worst of all, despite being\
      \ store-bought, the Achievements don't count towards the \"Perfect Games\" for\
      \ your profile, so all your tedious efforts will virtually be for nothing and\
      \ the game developers won't do a thing about that. \U0001F612\n\n...And in case\
      \ you haven't noticed by reading my other reviews for the aMAZE holiday games,\
      \ I'm pretty much repeating myself for each one. \U0001F644"
