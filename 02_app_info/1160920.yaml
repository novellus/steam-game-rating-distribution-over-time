      \ /><br>The old food truck you buy is in dire need of some proper cleaning.\
      \ It\u2019s not just removing some dirt with a sponge, there is among other\

      \ /><br>The used food truck you buy is an old piece of junk, there is no denying\
      \ it. You have to thoroughly clean it up before you can start rebuilding it.\
      \ All the interior has to be removed, the inside restored and then you have\
      \ to rebuild it using new furniture and appliances. This isn\u2019t as easy\
      \ as it might sound, as you are dealing with a limited space. <br>The interior\
      \ is not the only thing you have to take care of. Not only does the outside\
      \ need attention, you also have to take care of the food truck to be mechanically\
      \ in working condition again.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1160920/extras/CHOOSING.gif?t=1610102047\"\
      \ /><br>You need to define a menu that you are able to cook effectively in the\
      \ kitchen you created. The amount of items on the menu is limited by your kitchen\u2019\
      s capacity. But it isn\u2019t as simple as that. <br>Customers in different\
      \ areas have different tastes and expectations. Creating a menu that fulfills\
      \ those is crucial to avoiding customers approaching and leaving without an\
      \ order due to the menu lacking what they want.<br>Pricing obviously plays a\
      \ role, too. You can alter the entire menu or just the prices for different\
      \ customer types and locations. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1160920/extras/EXPANDING.gif?t=1610102047\"\
      \ /><br>You expand your food truck by buying more and better appliances for\
      \ your mobile kitchen or even upgrading to a better, larger food truck. The\
      \ menu itself is limited to 5 entries at the start of the game and can be expanded\
      \ to 20 entries with proper upgrades of the kitchen and storage facilities.<br><br>It\
      \ isn\u2019t however as simple as just the menu and the food truck. There is\
      \ an entire city to explore with different locations featuring different types\
      \ of customers with different expectations you will have to meet. The business\
      \ people in the financial district won\u2019t find much appeal in the menu you\
      \ created for the construction workers and vice-versa. You also don\u2019t want\
      \ to stick to one place the whole day, but instead relocate throughout the day\
      \ serving breakfast in the commercial district, lunch at the office park, use\
      \ the brunch time to be at the financial district and so on.<br>It is up to\
      \ you to find the most lucrative combination of times, locations and menu that\
      \ works for you and the capabilities of your food truck.<br><br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br>You can cook a wide variety of dishes and you have to do it on your\
      \ own paying attention to not only get the dishes right, but also to make them\
      \ quickly. The preparation and cooking process is detailed and requires you\
      \ to prepare all the ingredients. Some dishes have to be prepared and cooked\
      \ entirely on the spot, while others you can prepare at least partially beforehand\
      \ and store them in the fridge or appropriate storage. <br>Preparing and cooking\
      \ is based on real-life physics to bring the immersion of actually making dished\
      \ to a new level.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1160920/extras/SERVING.gif?t=1610102047\"\
      \ /><br>The game features a wide range of customers with different tastes, demands\
      \ and willingness to wait or tip. <br>While preparing food and serving customers\
      \ you also need to keep an eye on your supplies and alter the menu accordingly.\
      \ There is nothing worse than having lots of customers and running out of supplies\
      \ to cook and serve them or customers ordering food you realize you don\u2019\

      \ after you bought it is one thing, but you need to maintain it to keep it running.\
      \ The kitchen equipment as well as the truck itself are subject to wear and\
      \ tear. Cleaning, maintenance and repairs are tasks you have to familiarize\
      \ yourself with, but don\u2019t worry, you have your own little garage.<h2 class=\"\
