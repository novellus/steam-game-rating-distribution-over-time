    review: "Ah, so what can I say about Exeter? Horror movies don't often rely more\
      \ heavily on cliches than this one, so if \"don't watch it\" isn't clear enough,\
      \ I'll try to explain why it's not worth your time, and certainly not worth\
      \ your money. \n\nThe film opens with a few sequences to establish what every\
      \ teen-centric horror movie feels it must have: A group of teens who are repugnant\
      \ at every imaginable level (your stoner stereotype, your misogynist jerk stereotype,\
      \ your annoying younger hellraiser stereotype, and so on) comprise the forgettable\
      \ cast whose role is basically to line up in order and die obligingly, and the\
      \ filmmakes do their level best to be certain that you will dislike them all\
      \ just enough that you won't lament their passing. In this, at least, they are\
      \ successful. If the characters aren't cliche enough for you, the typical \"\
      asylum with a dark past\" setting is played for every tired note they could\
      \ come up with, and the worst part is it's played entirely straight, with no\
      \ sense of self-awareness of just how worn out these tropes are. \n\nSo, you\
      \ have the setting you don't care about, the characters you don't care about,\
      \ and then there is the general ineptitude surrounding handling of the camera\
      \ and lighting. Horror Movie 101 tells us that horror movies take place at night,\
      \ to make monsters harder to see, the scares scarier, the characters more vulnerable,\
      \ and so on. This movie takes place almost entirely in well-lit rooms, during\
      \ daylight hours (which is not typically when one holds a drug-fueled rave),\
      \ and this takes a considerable amount of the edge off. A horror movie taking\
      \ place in daylight might otherwise have been interesting, but, sadly, they\
      \ don't really do anything with this, and it comes off feeling more like these\
      \ people couldn't figure out how to shoot at night. Add to this the poor camera\
      \ handling (shaky cam, odd angles, too many out-of-focus shots, and so on) and\
      \ you have a recipe for disaster. \n\nWorst of all, this movie tries to pull\
      \ what our friend M. Night seems to have made necessary in all horror movies:\
      \ The twist ending. Without spoiling, I will say that if you didn't see this\
      \ twist coming after the first half hour, then you've either never seen a horror\
      \ film before, or you're much too young to be watching this movie. Your expectations\
      \ aside, the twist largely falls flat, not least because there is no work done\
      \ to make you care about these characters or what is happening to them. \n\n\
      I suppose it's worth noting that there is also nothing in this film that is\
      \ even remotely scary. They rely so heavily on images, plot points, stylized\
      \ renderings of frames from and what I suspect is an actual audio clip from\
      \ The Exorcist that this movie feels like a low-budget modern remake that couldn't\
      \ get the rights to the actual source material. Don't expect anything at all\
      \ frightening to happen in this movie that is two parts deranged high school\
      \ party, and one part exorcism-mystery. \n\nThe short version is that this film\
      \ isn't worth your time, your money, and manages to be exceptionally bad even\
      \ in an era when we are churning out enough bad horror films to run back to\
      \ back from now until the endtimes!"
