It's very visually interesting, though I'm not quite seeing what makes it 'Russian folkart'. Not that I know anything about Russian folkart anyway.\n\nIt might be [i]too[/i] visually interesting ... totally messed up my first game with it because I was paying more attention to how the pieces looked rather than where the pieces were on the board. That's not a mark against the set, though, but against my concentration.\n\nThe textures are of good quality - closely examining the pieces, it really looks like they've been hand-painted. It's fun to play with these.\n\nJust know that you're only getting one skin on a Staunton set, and no environments. \n\nI'm guessing that Purling had a lot of sway in the pricing of these pieces (it being their licensed material); or perhaps the license cost the devs so much that the devs need to charge this much to make even a modest profit on sales ... but from a consumer standpoint, the base $10 asking price is absolutely ridiculous, and shows how little Purling understands the digital DLC market.\n\nIt's not bad for $4, though even then it definitely feels like you're not getting good value for your money, considering $4 can get you much better DLCs in Chess Ultra. At $10, it's not worth buying.","timestamp_created":1542891526,"timestamp_updated":1542891645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626733005046844482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hMXgnecCe4LLsAE="}
