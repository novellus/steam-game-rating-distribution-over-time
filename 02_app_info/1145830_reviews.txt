Clarevoyance is a visual novel with light resource management elements set in the Acadian municipality of Clare in Nova Scotia. The images in the game are all taken in the region and all dialogue is voiced by locals in Acadian French with English subtitles. I am from New Brunswick originally so it sounds pretty nostalgic.\n\nYou play as someone visiting relatives in Clare over the summer. As you travel around doing different activities and \"spinning yarns\" with the locals, you start to realize that things are not quite as they seem. The story incorporates local legends in a way that was pretty clever and fun. The resource management portion involves earning money, buying food and managing your \"well being\", a sort of HP gauge that decreases when you use your powers to interact with the local mythology and increases when you do certain fun activities. There is also a time system where activities use up certain amounts of time in a day, and some things can only be done at specific times of day. There isn't a time limit though so you can take as long as you want to proceed through the story.\n\nFor any achievement hunters following me, a couple of the achievements didn't pop properly for me, but for anyone else I would recommend this charming game.","timestamp_created":1608951469,"timestamp_updated":1608951469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543080925941467285","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vOK+zvYCc46gvQI="}
