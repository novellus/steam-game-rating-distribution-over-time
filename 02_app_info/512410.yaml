    review: I really don't want to be that guy, but this game had a lot of potential
      and dropped the ball pretty hard. This is kind of Sh***y of me, but if you want
      an alternative option to this, check out my game End of Days. Would gladly add
      arm swinging locomotion as an option. http://store.steampowered.com/app/694660/End_of_Days/
