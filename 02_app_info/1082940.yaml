    about_the_game: How many gumballs can you have at once? How about all you can
      have? Go out on the street and check this old and forgotten gumball machinery.
      Arm yourself with your trusty mouse and enjoy action or puzzle-based play while
      you try to dethrone that pesky kid Kenny, from the high score table.<br><br>There
      are four different game modes and each one offers different play style and challenges:<br><br><strong>Puzzle
      By Puzzle</strong><br>In this game, you can take all the time you need and play
      at your own pace as you clear all 90 levels (30 levels per difficulty setting)
      of different gumball arrangements. In every level, you can shoot a predefined
      number of gumballs before the entire level drops one line down making things
      a bit harder to finish.<br><br><strong>Time Attack</strong><br>This game is
      the total opposite to the Puzzle by Puzzle game and it's all about time here.
      Put your mind and reflexes to the test by trying to clear all gumballs before
      the required level time runs out. There is a total of 60 levels (20 levels per
      difficulty setting), and times for all levels are added together to get the
      total time that gives you access into the high score table.<br><br><strong>Infinite
      Popping</strong><br>There is no end in this game mode, so go infinite and try
      to keep up as long as you can before being overrun by the rows and rows of incoming
      gumballs. To make things a bit more interesting every so often a new gumball
      flavor will try to make its way into the play area, so do your best to shoot
      it down before it explodes and makes things all that more interesting.<br><br><strong>Target
      Practice</strong><br>No pressure here. Take your time to practice so you can
      be ready for other fun and challenging game modes, or you can simply enjoy popping
      and splatting without any worries. But you have to clear all gumballs in order
      to qualify for the high score.<br><br>All games are divided into three difficulty
      levels. Easy, normal and hard. This allows you to start slowly and build your
      way through the more and more challenging play.  Also, all games feature six
      save game slots so you can save your progress and continue playing whenever
      you want.<br><br>Good luck and have fun dispatching countless colorful gumballs
      while enjoying full 3D graphics, playful fast-paced music and cartoony sound
      effects.
