The story is great, maybe a little unclear, but I still like it. The graphics look great, especially on the dinosaurs. There is just amazing looking areas that you get to just sit in, and view. I think the benefits of this game outweigh the bad. I do want to say though, the story has quite an abrupt ending.","timestamp_created":1609945077,"timestamp_updated":1609945077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40IqN7PYCdOKCwQI="}
