    review: 'A quirky game with charming visuals. My major gripe with the game is
      that it doesn''t support a controller, which would make the game more enjoyable
      in my opinion. I am just not used to arrow keys for movement like most boomers.
      I will definitely keep the game, but not play right now. I''ll save it for a
      rainy day when I have nothing else to do.


      For once the Steam algorithm recommended something interesting, usually I just
      get spammed with anime/hentai trash in my recommended.'
