      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Ghost on the Shore is a story and relationship exploration
      game about emotional ties that transcend even death.</h2><br><br>You play as
      Riley, a young woman who finds herself stranded on a desolate island with a
      headstrong ghost, dead for as long as he can remember.<br><br>As you explore
      the crumbling homes of the gone islanders and discover the remnants, you get
      to know the ghost Josh. Making irrevocable choices in dialogue you shape the
      bond with him, which ultimately influences the outcome of the game.<br><br>As
      Riley puts it all together, she comes to understand how an island's history
      led to Josh' death.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1211930/extras/Steam_gif_2.gif?t=1606207612"

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Relationship exploration</h2> is a unique feature that
      allows the player to make choices in a subtle immersive way. Often all one has,
      is the power of words. And it is your choice to reach out or to alienate. Like
      in real life, you don't always know how your words will affect the other. Or
      what future they hold.<h2 class="bb_tag">Emotional storytelling</h2> is something
      that we are both passionate and curious about. Players identify deeply with
      characters of flesh and blood that they can relate to. Through complex characters,
      we're able to tell stories that trigger a universal set of emotions.<br><br><br><img

    reviews: "\u201CI really want to hone in on how nice the dynamic is between Riley\
      \ and Josh. Sure, they've only just met and Josh is inhabiting her body, but\
      \ they still have time for banter. The environments are simple but coloured\
      \ in such a gorgeous way that it feels like you're wandering around an oil painting.\u201D\
