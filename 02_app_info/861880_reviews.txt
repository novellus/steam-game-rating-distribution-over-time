This magnificent 10-wheeler is a loving look at the rise of powerful steam locomotives in America. No detail has been omitted here! I am continually delighted by the beauty and accuracy of this engine, and needless to say its well worth the asking price! As for the driving experience, this engine is both challenging and rewarding. There is a tactility to operating the Buffalo that just isn't present in any of the other train sim add ons I've played (spare for the other Smokebox add ons!) From the car-to-car sway, to the rattling of the linkages everything present seeks to immerse you. \n\nMy only gripes are minor, such as the whistle sample being a tad low quality (slight grain, cuts off just a moment too soon), and the engine not being able to be configured with a diamond stack (however I hear this might soon become a feature!) \n\nIf you are into steam motive power, do yourself a favor and jump on this pack! Support the developer and maybe we can expect more early american engines ;D","timestamp_created":1604812397,"timestamp_updated":1604812397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nLuR0/UCdtyIrQI="}
