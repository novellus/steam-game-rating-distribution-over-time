    about_the_game: Ostriv aims to raise the bar of city-building experience by adding
      a huge amount of possibilities and removing annoying limitations. It allows
      for truly organic town layouts without the grid and angle restrictions on a
      three-dimensional landscape. The goal is to make player's creations to become
      alive and believable communities where real-life problems would arise, thus
      making the late game a new challenge rather than a repetitive chore.<br><br><strong>This
      game is still in development! Please buy it only if you want to support the
      development and provide detailed bug reports and feedback to help make it a
      masterpiece it deserves to be. The development is slow and steady, which means
      there can be long delays between updates</strong>
