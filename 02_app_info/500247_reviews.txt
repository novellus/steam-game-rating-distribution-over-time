The side doors and windows do open and you can get a central view (other than the traditional right and left side view). The major problem I want to point out which unfortunately led me to not recommending this is the career scenarios... They're just not driveable. I can't even go even 20 miles under the limit with no stress on the brakes/throttle without getting a driving quality reduction for no entire reason for the vast majority of the session. This in particular happens most on the legacy 'Northeast Corridor' route. It's basically impossible to get a perfect score (yet I don't know how other people do it and still make it on time to every station is beyond me). Personally I've never been fond of the drive quality penalty. I would propose you'd either remove/fix that feature to begin with, and/or fix this specific DLC since I'm having most problems with this one with it. Otherwise I'm keeping my review as-is. It's not fair to me and takes away the realism from the career scenario.","timestamp_created":1572874276,"timestamp_updated":1572874276,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwypmnm+4CcNC81wE="}
