    review: "[h1]Short version: 86%[/h1]\nThanks to an unconventional storyline about\
      \ a chaotic family drama and some wonderful hidden object scenes, Blood Ruby\
      \ is a great addition to the HOG genre, despite its tendency to overuse point\
      \ \u2018n\u2019 click components.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nSaving a relative\
      \ is a common theme in hidden object games. Travelling back in time to end up\
      \ in a murder investigation that eventually leads to a surprisingly messed-up\
      \ and bloody domestic feud\u2026 well, that takes it several steps beyond expected\
      \ levels. \n\nDark Cases: The Blood Ruby has more than just this memorable plot\u2014\
      or similarly memorable beautiful artwork, for that matter. It is a roughly three-hour\
      \ joyride with some pacing bumps and a few outlandish elements, elevating its\
      \ murder mystery far above similar casual detective stories.\n\nAdmittedly,\
      \ the game relies on these elements to keep the players invested, because it\
      \ is a bit too keen on relying on classic adventure game methods, including\
      \ a perpetually overcrowded inventory. The hidden object scenes are great, but\
      \ too few to turn The Blood Ruby into the truly unforgettable HOG masterpiece\
      \ its story would deserve."
