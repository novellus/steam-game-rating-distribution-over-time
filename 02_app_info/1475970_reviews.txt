Defentron is definitely a classic tower defense with the added bonus of a tron-like visual and a good soundtrack.\n\nThe levels, for me, started out a little easy but they quickly grew challenging. I haven't been stuck on a level yet, when I find a bump, I know there's a way around. \n\nI've been moving through the first worlds rather fast but now it's getting to the good part.\n\nI definitely recommend it. As I write this I got 2 stars on a level and that won't do, time to get back to it!","timestamp_created":1608899687,"timestamp_updated":1608899687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pZ75zPYCeYGFvQI="}
