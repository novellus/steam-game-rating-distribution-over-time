If you don't like microtransactions like buying seeds but still want to support the game, this is a good way too. It's only 7 bucks, and is a wonderful OST for relaxation, meditation, studying, sleeping, etc. Definitely worth the 7$ for me, as I use this literally anytime I'm doing a hard project, or whenever I need a good simple track that's not lofi to sleep to.","timestamp_created":1591231682,"timestamp_updated":1591231682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3ZKzvvICdYmEjAI="}
