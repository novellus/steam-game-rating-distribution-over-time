In other words, hardly famous because barely anyone seems to remember SkyRoads.\n\nThat aside, it's a decent game overall. Courses are a bit short and simple imo, but they're still fun. Music is good - just note that its post-'80s style is nothing like SkyRoads's dream-like synth. The romance feels rushed and even tacky at times, but at least the overall story's pretty good - an eye and a pilot at large with their selves. The biggest flaw by far is its length. A first playthrough is only an hour long, and especially for $10 US (though this DOES go on sale!), there's a lot more room for both story and gameplay. Regardless, Nirvana Pilot Yume is a fun one-off - especially for those who loved SkyRoads.","timestamp_created":1608262597,"timestamp_updated":1608262597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mPf6ufYCf4SMuwI="}
