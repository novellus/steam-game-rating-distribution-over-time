You can play up to 4-players i thought...but not if you only have the options of keyboard/joystick for 1st player, joystick for second...and only move right/jump for player 3 and 4. Huh? Yes...it's as confusing as it sounds. \n\nWhy on earth would you not just have a simple \" Right-Left \" option for each player's movement, along with one or two button inputs per player for jumping? How the heck can you mess this up? IN 2019?! \n\nYeah...i need my refund right now.","timestamp_created":1567467905,"timestamp_updated":1567467905,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469817757606506348","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/sOX+uwCcfbK0QE="}
