I might be missing something, but there is apparently no way to turn left, and the car seems to want to go into reverse all the time.  There are no real instructions to the game, so maybe I am missing something, but it should not be that complex to get such a simple game running. If you like doing donuts in a car and driving in a circle, this is the game for you. I do not recommend buying it.","timestamp_created":1537915542,"timestamp_updated":1537915542,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1538284360,"developer_response":"You should connect your controller after the game starts (it is stated in the games page) and the game will run as suppose to . Sorry for that , its a bug i could not fix.\nYou can always play with your cursor keys but if you have your game pad connected before you run the game it will not work.\nJim Dex"}],"cursor":"AoJwn5u6ieYCct22qwE="}
