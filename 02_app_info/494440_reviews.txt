I LOVE hakuoki, iv played the psp version years ago and played all of the first kinda remake and a bit of the 2nd part of that. If you are looking at this and hakuoki do yourself a huge favor and get hakuoki. The stories are really lengthy so def bang for your buck and has lots of historical points and info inside it. It goes on sale for a lot ususaly so its cheap to get both. But back to this game. I get phone visual novels and such lot of the time are short or cliche or have weird angles they try to justify the story they play. But while playing heisuke's story (well try to) just now, i just cant. I cant at all give a pass or any justification for practically forced sexual acts/rape, It is a a sad excuse of \"live in the moment, could die tomorrow!\" ppl are dying all around its not sexy time. And its not even sexy time with it all forced even after struggle. A person acting as a kid and \"innocent\" does not make that ok. I was so hoping it would let you slap him to get him to wake up but no, the \"correct\" answer is its fine or you actually want it too when it shows her trying to struggle and he keeps forcing it. I am just baffled by how it tried to do his story to point i just cant read that bull of his story any further. I may try the others to see if they have any hope of having some ounce of substance but god. I figured i wouldn't like heisuke's story most due to his personality compared to the rest but no way was I prepared for the shitfire i read.","timestamp_created":1601701064,"timestamp_updated":1601701064,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1NW09vQCd9bEpQI="}
