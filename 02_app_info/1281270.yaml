        and abuse. This game also contains flashing images and lights that may trigger

    review: "Fatum Betula is, arguably, a nearly perfect video game, depending upon\
      \ your philosophy when it comes to criticism. If you, like me, believe that\
      \ to a large extent the success of a game depends upon how well it achieved\
      \ what it set out to do, I think you can get very far with such an argument.\
      \ \n\nAfter all, Fatum Betula more faithfully recaptures the look and feel of\
      \ playing weird japanese PS1 games as a child than anything I\u2019ve yet seen,\
      \ and that is clearly what it set out to do. The aesthetic is spot on, right\
      \ down to the swimmy textures. It\u2019s sharper and higher framerate than the\
      \ actual games it\u2019s a throwback to, but doesn\u2019t improve things enough\
      \ for you to really notice, it just looks like how you remember those games\
      \ looking. \n\nThe gameplay itself entirely consists of talking to people, using\
      \ items on things, and filling and emptying a set of vials with various liquids.\
      \ It stretches these basic interactions into a truly captivating and haunting\
      \ world full of secret endings and hidden areas and weirdness and wonder. And\
      \ it somehow imparts these nostalgic feelings with ruthless economy, it took\
      \ under three hours to see all the endings but I felt like I had gone on a much\
      \ longer journey. \n\nIf you have any nostalgia at all for weird PS1 games like\
      \ King\u2019s Field, LSD: Dream Emulator, Soul Reaver, Clock Tower, or Tail\
      \ of the Sun Fatum Betula is an absolute must play."
