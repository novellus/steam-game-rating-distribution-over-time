Some of the tracks evoke the atmosphere of the game pretty nicely, which is what I bought this for. The highlights are \"The Town,\" \"Main Theme,\" \"Jotunn Theme,\" \"Into The Night,\" \"A Second Midday Shopping Spree.\" The rest is a very nice bonus. I recommend listening to this with headphones.\n\nAbout the game: Shoppe Keep 2 is a casual relaxing game along the lines of Farm Together. The gameplay is completely different, but the feel is the same. You do what you want, when you want it. You are not pressed for time, you pick your own objectives, etc in an amusing, non-intrusive game world.","timestamp_created":1575380927,"timestamp_updated":1575380927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oaiB5u4CeKfJ4QE="}
