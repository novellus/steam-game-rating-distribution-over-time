    review: "This game was so beautiful and a blast to play. Playtime should be around\
      \ 2 to 3 hours, I believe I kicked it into 4 hours from just not knowing how\
      \ to progress at some parts of the game. At some places I felt like they weren't\
      \ really explaining how to progress and I had to look it up. The story was very\
      \ cute and not over dramatic. \n\nStill a fun game to play, price is perfect\
      \ and I look forward to seeing more. Here is the first part to my play through:\n\
