    about_the_game: Feeling stressed? Treat yourself to this therapeutic VR refuge
      from the real world with procedurally generated realms of gentle sounds, sweet-tasting
      colors, and breathtaking beauty.<br><br>Find and catch the bouncing spheres
      to visit different worlds. Find the perfect place to relax and watch the virtual
      world go by. There are no enemies, quests, guns, or puzzles. There is no objective
      other than to relax and enjoy.<br><br>The experience allows you to experience
      a simulation of synesthesia, a mixing of senses, where you can <strong>see sounds</strong>
      and <strong>hear colors</strong>. Each &quot;popsicle&quot; produces a sound
      that is based on their color, with a loudness based on their height and position.
      The sounds you hear are based on the colors around you. For more interesting
      soundscapes, seek out patches with mixed colors, interesting formations, or
      rapidly moving landscapes.<br><br>Play for 5-20 minutes before bed, or after
      a stressful day, or when you're feeling depressed/anxious. By the end of the
      session, you'll feel much less stressed, more relaxed and happy. You will be
      able to sleep more easily, and you might even have vividly colorful dreams when
      you sleep.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/992960/extras/lullaby_600x150.gif?t=1552021871"

    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/ZLMqxxYZ6WQ\n\nI actually\
      \ like this app. It's very colorful and has a nice relaxing mood to it. It's\
      \ an other-worldly experience. However, it's very limited in content and, in\
      \ my opinion, it's over-priced for what it is.\n\nYou may get 10-20 minutes\
      \ of relaxation entertainment from this app, but there isn't anything here to\
      \ draw you back in after that first wondrous experience. It does get repetitive.\
      \ Unless you can showcase this to several friends or family, it may not be worth\
      \ the purchase price. \n\nYou do have full locomotion that is headset-gaze based\
      \ (not controller), you basically move forward to where you're looking. You\
      \ have snap turning as well. You can take screenshots by pressing down both\
      \ grip buttons and you can stop the landscape motion by pressing trigger. \n\
      \nI would have liked to have other scenes included (at least 3 different scenarios),\
      \ other than this one that just has some slight random variations each time.\
      \ You can touch the bouncing balls that make chime sounds to get another random\
      \ variation on the same theme. It will also change the music (that all sounds\
      \ kind of the same). I would have liked the option to listen to my own music.\
      \ It would be cool if the scenes reacted to my music. \n\n[b]Rate 5/10. [/b]"
