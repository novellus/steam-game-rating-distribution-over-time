    review: 'Much like Episode 2 of In Fear I Trust, this third entry into the episodic
      game has seemingly little to do with the very first installment; nor its predecessor.
      This time, Patient #17, aka Nikolay, is exploring a decrepit, abandoned factory
      that he used to work at. Carrying on with the enigmatic method of storytelling,
      this episode is actually crafted out of Nikolay''s own memories, but any correlation
      of the events shown here and the previous entries is completely shrouded in
      mystery. Episode 3 comes off feeling more like detective work rather than having
      to do anything with horror or psychological thrillers.


      Again, the puzzles are extremely easy, and again a chunk of them don''t even
      need to be completed in order to finish the episode. This entry is a bit shorter
      than the others, coming in at around 20-30 minutes of playtime as most of the
      events, puzzles, and notes are all within close proximity of each other. Episode
      3 is a much more enjoyable part of the In Fear I Trust series, and out of all
      four episodes it''s really the only one worth playing. It''s easy to play as
      a stand-alone, as no events in the series are well connected. However, having
      to purchase the base game in order to play this episode rules out any hope of
      actually recommending it as a purchase.


      [h1]Rating: [b]2.5/5.0[/b] - It''s not awful, but it''s not great.[/h1]
