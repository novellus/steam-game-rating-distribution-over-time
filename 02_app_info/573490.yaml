    review: 'Imho not worth 20$. This seems fine for around 5$, as I doubt most people
      will currently play this for more than a few hours.


      The basics of the game are fairly simple and the concept is decent.

      However, the UI is terrible. The execution of the game concept and optimization
      does not feel good either.


      I think this game does have potential if the developer improves mid-game and
      late-game and fixes the terrible UI.


      At the current state, I would only recommend picking this up if it''s e.g. around
      5$ and you''re a fan of trading/space games.'
