      the Tear inadvertently draw you and your group into a violent, three-sided battle
      over the relic. Your quest leads you from the dizzying heights of Krondor's
      Palace, through the twisting tunnels of the sewers beneath the city, and into
      the haunted depths of a temple dedicated to an evil as ancient as the gods themselves.<br><br><br><ul

    review: "Gioco molto sottovalutato che, senz'altro, i fan di Raymond E. Feist\
      \ apprezzeranno, idem tutti gli altri. Sono presenti, tuttavia, delle pecche\
      \ che non lo salvano dalla prova del tempo, come i controlli macchinosi e vari\
      \ bug, oltre al fatto che non dispone di sottotitoli (neanche in inglese), anche\
      \ se quest'ultimo problema, alla fin fine, \xE8 poco rilevante, dato che i dialoghi\
      \ sono abbastanza facili da capire. Un plauso alla colonna sonora, l'ho apprezzata\
      \ tantissimo."
