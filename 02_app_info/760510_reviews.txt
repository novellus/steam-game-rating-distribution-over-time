Kat the world's best cat burglar has entered the highly secure doggo base, her mission to steal all their gems.\n\nNow the likes. Well the game is very cute from the characters and to the little bit of story we have in the game. The game's Graphics are pretty good and captures the feel of an old school platformer. \n\nThe music very good especially the music for the last level it has a nice spy feel to it. It was great that after completing the main game you can play two more games one being collecting Jewels under a certain amount of time, the other game collecting the Four Keys with a whole bunch of dogs in the area.\n\nIt was also very awesome that after you beat a level in the main game you are shown different advertisements too animal charities/shelters, that was again very awesome.\n\nNow the dislikes. There is a bug in the game where I got stuck between something and I couldn't move no matter what I did and had to restart the level. \n\nAll right that said Cat Burglar: A Tail of Purrsuit is a good and an adorable, Adventure , 3D Platformer game. With very good music, pretty good Graphics and cute characters and story.\n\nSo if you're looking for a casual game this could be for you it's free, but I suggest that if you have $3 donate to games for goods if you want to lend a hand.","timestamp_created":1606612377,"timestamp_updated":1606612435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501061558723449707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g4jkiPYCcKzwtAI="}
