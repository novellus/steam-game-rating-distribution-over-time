    review: "I've tested this benchmark on various rigs back in 2014 and still use\
      \ it this to this date, I've never had any issues or crashes only from when\
      \ running unstable overclocks. \nDon't understand all the hate on this benchmark.\
      \ Does a decent measure of power, and you can compare your performance scores\
      \ to other systems on their leaderboard.\nThe only issue I've had is just visual\
      \ ones from their website where things are not perfectly aligned. However, I\
      \ generally put these scores on the HWBot and do my comparisons there. \n\n\
      Other than 3DMark, this is my go to Benchmark and I just love the visuals and\
      \ the music from this application. Music quality is decent, highs reaches a\
      \ good range, tweeter separation is clear, bass is slightly flat and lacks low\
      \ frequencies but does still hit hard on a 12\" sealed box. Good dubstep example."
