    review: "This was the first music driven game I have played in VR and I really\
      \ hope it won't be the last. VR opens up so many more possibilities for immersion\
      \ and music. There are music driven games out there that can really pull you\
      \ in, and VR has the capability of taking that and pushing it to the next level.\n\
      \nThis game is okay. It's not the best, I wouldn't say it's next level material\
      \ but I did get that hyped-up and happy feeling from playing a few of my favourite\
      \ songs. Your surroundings are bright, colourful and it dances with your music.\
      \ I found it fun to even stand and look around, let alone bust out some drum\
      \ moves.\n\nI won't lie to you, I held back a bit seeing as I was banging  imaginary\
      \ drums like a moron to no music in the family dining area. If I would have\
      \ been alone I think I would of gone in on this a lot more enthusiastically\
      \ and gotten my rave on. With that said though I still found this to be a very\
      \ enjoyable game.\n\nWhen I booted up the game I was a little concerned that\
      \ I would have to download some music for it to go from or be forced to use\
      \ some lame sample music that music driven games tend to provide. The fun in\
      \ these games for me comes from being able to put my own music tastes into the\
      \ game. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can actually pick some music\
      \ from the SoundCloud top 50 (so of course I had to get on that Despacito bandwagon).\n\
      \nThe only thing I thought might make this game better was if hitting the drum\
      \ actually did something. I mean, it does something, it determines your score\
      \ and all. I just thought that it would feel a lot better if when you hit it,\
      \ it actually made a sound. \nIf you loosely compare it to guitar hero, in guitar\
      \ hero the music will play as long as you're playing it properly. Hitting the\
      \ notes will continue to play the song and if you miss it you get that horrid\
      \ noise that breaks the flow and makes you feel like the worst musician ever.\
      \ Then when you actually hit the notes correctly you feel a lot more accomplished\
      \ and it gets you more hyped up during the song. \n\nThat was my only fault\
      \ on it, besides that I enjoyed it and would recommend it for someone that might\
      \ just want a chill jam on the virtual reality drums.\n\n\nTL;DR : Not the best\
      \ music driven game ever, it might not take advantage of the new possibilities\
      \ VR provides, but it's still an all around sound game to jam out on.\n\n[quote][b]Controller\
