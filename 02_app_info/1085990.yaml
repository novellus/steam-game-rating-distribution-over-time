    review: 'I''m a huge Pac-Man fan so when I see a maze game I try to give it a
      try. This is a mix of Pac-Man, Bomberman, and Tank. It''s got new stuff, like
      being mindful of ammo collection, timing, and ingots, and I liked the fact that
      I can shoot while moving forward or backward. On the negative side, let''s just
      say that co-op is more difficult than solitaire.
