Of course they set it up to possibly be continued but it is a nice ending if left where its at.\n\nWhile for me a lot of the story was predictable it was still a good one. I have no issues with recommending this anime to anyone and think a lot of people would find this one enjoyable.\n\nThis is also one of the few anime where I did not actually hate any of the characters. One character in particular I kind of liked though she is a bit of a odd one. ( Not going to say who, but if you end up watching the series you will find out yourself.. Ya'know? )\n\nNow here is where I will give a warrning again about steam's video player and crunchyroll. The video player needs work. Part of it is due to the fact that how things are handled by Valve and Crunchyroll and until some things are changed I feel it will probably always be a problem. On the bright side this anime is not censored at all. ( and there really is not a need for anything to be censored anyway. Gore or otherwise. )","timestamp_created":1498302763,"timestamp_updated":1498312126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447631359100341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw45WX7dwCctPpfA=="}
