      /><br><br>A. Fruit comes from the background of producing bass music, with her
      tracks commercially released in compilations in USA, UK, Japan, Russia, Poland
      and Argentina. She is based in Moscow and frequently performs as a DJ in Russian
      and European music clubs.<br><br>The collaboration between Charlie Oscar and
      A. Fruit started in Vilnius in the summer of 2015. Throughout the following
      years, A. Fruit created over 300 custom sound effects and 31 original music
      tracks. In her own words: &quot;this album is mostly experimental stuff made
      with the sounds of old clocks and other mechanic noises I''ve recorded. Being
      composed with vintage instruments and mixed with the interface sounds of the
      game, it reminds of the electroswing and the hip-hop music, but with the atmosphere
      of an industrial steampunk town.&quot;<br><br>Total playtime: 1:31:09. MP3 320,
      FLAC.'
