    review: "A masterpiece. Truly excellent. A perfect follow up to Myst that leaves\
      \ openings to future games. \n\n   The only downsides I have found is it crashes\
      \ on windows 7 every once in a great while, I have not had that problem on Windows\
      \ 10. Also there's no more exploring when the game has been completed, but then\
      \ the story line wouldn't work if you could still explore once completed. I\
      \ made this spoiler free so no worries.  Make certain you feel you have finished\
      \ doing everything you want before releasing the prisoner. The game blocks you\
      \ from doing anything else except finishing the story once that has been done.\
      \ It can just be rather annoying, but it is easier to deal with as long as you\
      \ know that is the situation when releasing the prisoner. You understand what\
      \ I am talking about once you get to a certain point into the game. Have questions\
      \ feel free to send me a message.\n\n   There's one hidden movie in the folder\
      \ of movies I could not find in game. There might not be a way to get it to\
      \ play in game. Maybe someone can figure it out. The movie is just Gehn walking\
      \ across the screen singing. You will not miss anything by not finding it, but\
      \ it is fun. \n\n   Now they just need to remake it like they did realMyst:\
      \ Masterpiece Edition."
