    review: 'This is an emulated version of the Genesis/Mega Drive game Gadget Twins.
      The emulator being used is Mednafen, which is generally [url=http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Mednafen#Overview]not[/url]
      one of the better emulators for the Genesis, but it seems to do a decent enough
      job for this particular game. At least through stage 2 (out of 6), I haven''t
      encountered any noticeable problems yet.


      Piko hasn''t included the original manual with this release, and I couldn''t
      find a scanned copy anywhere online, but you can get brief instructions at [url=https://segaretro.org/The_Gadget_Twins#Gameplay]Sega
      Retro[/url]


      Even though Gadget Twins came out in 1992, it''s a pretty unique game even today.
      It''s basically a shoot ''em up, except both you and the enemies mostly use
      melee attacks instead of projectiles. You can attack in any of the four primary
      directions, which you can rotate between by pressing a button or key. All enemies
      drop coins, which are used in mid-level shops to buy basic upgrades for your
      weapons. There are also temporary power-ups that can be found by breaking open
      chests along the way.


      As you can probably guess by the title, this game was designed to be played
      with a partner in co-op. It''s very difficult solo, especially when fighting
      the bosses. There also isn''t any difference in game balance between the two
      modes, other than in co-op you''ll have to share the money instead of keeping
      it all for yourself. Then again, this version of the game also allows you to
      save anywhere by pressing the ESC key, so you can savescum your way through
      the game if you want to.


      Other than that save anywhere feature, nothing else has been added to this version
      of Gadget Twins. But since there''s not any other games like it that I can think
      of, and with it only costing $4, I would still recommend it at least for shmup
      fans who are interested in trying something different.'
