Maybe a bit overpriced for what it is but the base game is free and very addicting. I thought after 200+ hours, i could give them 10 bucks to support them. \n\nI chose the cute reindeer because that's it lol. Best part of this is that you can actually go ingame and see the skins before you buy them so no reason to be disappointed.\n\nSo yes, overpriced for what it is but not pay to win because you can earn rubies to get autoclicker in game for free. And the skin is cool but it's just a skin. Nothing unbalancing the game.\n\nSo yes, have fun getting one as it will carry you for hours without having to use a third party software!","timestamp_created":1562596239,"timestamp_updated":1562596239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46cz/6OsCdt3tzQE="}
