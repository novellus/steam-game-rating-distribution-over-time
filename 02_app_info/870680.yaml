    review: '--- Alien themed puzzle solving platformer with shooting mechanics. ---


      DESCRIPTION

      This game is overly bad. Not inherently bad, since it have some cool ideas and
      concepts, but definitely done way too quick. I can''t recommend a game like
      this because, for me at least, it quickly became boring, repetitive and difficult
      (in the bad way, the one that makes you feel the game is unfair). In the other
      hand, with very little tweaks here and there, I think the game could improve
      MASSIVELY, specially by polishing the character control. I don''t know if the
      developers will update the game in the future, but if they do, I''ll probably
      have to change my recommendation.


      Be careful IF YOU HAVE MOTION SICKNESS because this game will most surely trigger
      it!

      _________________________________________________



      BAD STUFF

      Weird mouse input lag, probably caused by V-Sync?

      Continuous strong camera shake when firing. (they have a slider now, thank god)

      Bad movement control and feeling.

      Not relevant sprites drawn in front of main character.

      Weird main character collision box.

      The checkpoint spiraling sprite is the most seen and the less prety.

      No minimap or way to know where to go or where have you been.

      Hard to differentiate enemies with the background.

      Enrage mode is not achievable outside bossfights, at least in low levels.

      Gravity is extremely high for a platformer, it makes very difficult to control
      the character when falling.


      BAD STUFF: LEVEL 1

      I found the secondary shooting mode by chance, didn''t even see it.

      Door that regenerates self is not explained, you have to figure out how to break
      it.

      Nearly imposible jumps whitout hurting yourself, not a good jump to make in
      the first level.

      There are weird purple and red circles around that appear to do nothing.

      The first boss doesn''t give you a wide enough timeframe to be able to evade
      his attacks, specially when camera shake doesn''t even let you focus your eyes
      on it.


      BAD STUFF: LEVEL 2

      Now the controlled missile mechanic is getting old and difficult at the same
      time.

      Enemies can get stuck just under the floor tile you are standing on and quickly
      hit you when peeking.

      A turret hit me just as a puzzle locked door was opening, not even a second
      given to evade the hit.

      A turret hit me before even appearing on the screen.

      The spring system apply the upward force waaaaaay to quick.

      There is a zone where it seems you can''t go further because an impossible jump.
      Turns out that there are green buttons (which until now means they are OK) that
      when shoot turn red again, and place floor tiles to make the jump. 100% intuitive!


      (Writting date until this point:  3 Aug 2018)


      BAD SUFF: LEVEL 3

      Once you have dealt with this game controls for 2 hours or more, it starts to
      look like it might be playeable.

      This level have some weird missile puzzle that are actually not that difficult
      to do, but hard to spot and understand.Sometimes, you have to take your time
      and scratch your head until you realize what you have todo. Others, the buttons
      you have to hit are just waaaay out of your normal sight, so you are gonna spend
      some time looking for them.


      BAD STUFF: LEVEL 4

      I got the enrage mode out of a boss fight!

      There is a puzzle where the clue is written with the same material as the floor.
      I don''t know if people will see it, but I just shoot the buttons until it opened
      (took me 20 seconds) and then realize the solution was just below me.

      The boss is cool! There are some mobs that spawn weirdly because they are been
      spawned out of the screen, so they fall when you jump... and there is a non
      explained "rule" in fase 3 which consist in climbing to the side platforms when
      the boss is attacking with the laser because it is the only way of dodge it.aaaaaaa


      BAD STUFF: LEVEL 5

      The level layout is bonkers. You kinda can find your way around by following
      the cables but let me tell you something, there are LOTS of cables and aaaaaall
      of them >yellow<. Please, use different colors, it''s not that hard :c

      Also, there is a black hole behind a box, close to a turret. If you dont figure
      it out quickly, Mr.Turret is gonna kill you because his bullets are not affected
      by it, but yours do.

      I just figured out turrets can AND WILL shoot you through regenerative doors.


      (Writting date until this point:  5 Aug 2018)


      BAD STUFF: LEVEL 6

      The level is splited in two zones, right and left. I have been wandering the
      right part over and over, for more or less 40 minutes and I am unable to reach
      the other half of the leve. I have followed the wires, the walls, I have reloaded
      the level and the game, etc...

      I think I have had enough of this game for now, so I''m gonna wait for some
      month and see if they fix it.


      (Writting date until this point:  6 Aug 2018)


      _________________________________________________



      GOOD STUFF

      Enrage mode is cool.

      I found what looks like a secret zone and rescued a marine.

      There are abundant lives spaced around.
