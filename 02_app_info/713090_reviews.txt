However, this title actually surprised me with its \"8bits box-like\" cute -but deadly!- character design, its spiking difficulty and its fun gameplay. \n\nAlso, its simple mechanics combined with actually tough challenges and a huge variety of characters, weapons and environments, makes it a game that never gets old, because the scenarios are always changing.  \n\nIf you are looking for a fun, different and challenging game, then you should try this one out.\n\nI'm really glad the devs reached out to me to take a look at their game, I think it's worth every penny. I am looking forward to playing day 2!\n","timestamp_created":1514559778,"timestamp_updated":1514559778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47486037015914917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzYWz0eACcvSLlAE="}
