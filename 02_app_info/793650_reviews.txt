Just more of the same, go grab some firework for the boss, done...\nThey didn't even took the time to make an achievment for completed this DLC.\nWhich is weird, because completing Goblins part 1 did give an achievment.\n\nI feel this extra level is just a money grab, even making these DLC's while the maingame is FULL of buggs is bad.\n\nAlso, the bossfight in this DLC has a massive bug, I had to restart the game (ALT-F4) three times untill I found a card I could click that didn't freeze the game.\n\nSo, enjou the long main adventure, and be happy with it, this DLC is downhill from that.","timestamp_created":1527705375,"timestamp_updated":1527705375,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.727793693542480469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcKV2eMCfPHZoQE="}
