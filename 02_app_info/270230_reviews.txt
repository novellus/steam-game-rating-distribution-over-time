Otherwise, skip it. I don't understand the high ratings. There's very little story, no characters to interact with, visually dull, and most of the time you are clueless trying to figure out what the next step is in fixing this broken down place. I played for three hours and gave up, not a bit interested in what happens next. \n","timestamp_created":1609116707,"timestamp_updated":1609116707,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4210/YCcZr4vQI="}
