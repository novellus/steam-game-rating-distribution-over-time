Playing with people on their phones is a cool idea but it uses a browser instead of the Spaceteam app which was disappointment #1. Some of the phone players weren't able to see all their controls.  We also had trouble getting games to start and often had phone users get dropped out of the game or spawn on top of a VR player causing them to have two sets of controls. Maybe it'll be better after a few more updates.","timestamp_created":1608148809,"timestamp_updated":1608148809,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608194472,"developer_response":"Hi loof.\n\nThanks for leaving a review.\n\nWe put out a new update yesterday, which includes some tweaks and performance fixes. We're also still constantly updating the game on all formats.\n\nSpaceteam VR isn't directly related to the mobile app (different developer), which is why our local mobile connectivity uses the free browser client instead. The mobile connectivity was added as a way for people to play a game locally, with many households only having 1 VR headset. However, the game is primarily designed to be played between players on VR platforms.\n\nWe do have some more updates coming in the early new year which will offer greater platform support and even more ways to play with your friends and family."}],"cursor":"AoJ40u7ItvYCcfbjugI="}
