I am feeling it needs more - most especially multiple quest tracking.  I would also really like a mini-map.  I also want to add map notes/markers to things I find and want to come back to.   I also feel the side quests offered so far are skewed mostly to evil with occasional good alternate turn in popping up.  [spoiler] First side quest offered was to strong arm people to paying for family graves - ugh no thanks. [/spoiler] I set my character up as a science/eng not 'paladin' who enforces laws good or bad.  I knew the second the main quest said [spoiler] to steal the power core from the protesters and force em back to company slavery [/spoiler] that I would not do that - sheesh.","timestamp_created":1609942821,"timestamp_updated":1609942821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iL2E7PYCcseBwQI="}
