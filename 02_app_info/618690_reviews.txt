I wouldn't compare to doom as much as I would compare it to quake.  Fast and intense gameplay with fun enemies and fun arenas.  It is 100% worth your money.  It also comes with a level editor which took a couple hours to understand but it is very fun to use.  The soundtrack and sounds are great.  One of my top games.  Buy it.  If you don't have the money or still don't want it then get the demo and see for yourself how fun the game is.","timestamp_created":1608489887,"timestamp_updated":1608489887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40fzdwPYCdOXiuwI="}
