It has responsive controls, excellent chiptune music, fittingly retro graphics, with snazzy \"particle effects\" for projectiles and impacts. That said, I'd like to see it include achievements (and/or some in-game challenges). At the moment there's not much to do besides beating your high score. I think it's best to get this for about 1 dollar (~50% off), but it still gets a solid 8/10 from me.","timestamp_created":1601930329,"timestamp_updated":1601930329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4up+f/fQCdMOMpgI="}
