    review: 'Loved it! You can tell the developer put a lot of attention to every
      detail of the project. The writing is good and fun, like a cheeky Lovecraftian
      storyline. The music and the art is great, really gives you the feel of it being
      a game made by a company back in the early days of videogames.


      For a small project, you get a good amount of things to do in the game besides
      beating it. Collect letters, solve situations with different items, have different
      endings, do a puzzle. The fact that the developer is active on the forum answering
      people''s questions is also a positive point in my book. You can see that they
      care about the work they''ve put out.


      So, although is a complete (short) adventure... I''m left wanting more! I''ll
      definitely keep an eye on this for the next installments of the series. For
      such a small price, I would seriously advice people to give it a chance. This
      is the type of project you want to support.'
