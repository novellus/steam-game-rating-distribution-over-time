    review: "Undercover Agent is an espionage thriller scarcely worthy of the name.\
      \ It is thin, tame and predictable, with one-dimensional characters ever keen\
      \ to speak the plot and ramifications of the choice system back to you. It is\
      \ exceptionally short, and very few of the coordinates set at the beginning\
      \ of the story change by the end. You are largely siphoned through a predetermined\
      \ series of events in which you may succeed or fail, and as ever accomplish\
      \ differently depending on the skill set you have chosen to develop. The scope\
      \ of the story and its settings feel minute and \u2013 something that I find\
      \ to be increasingly rare in COG productions \u2013 written from someone's bedroom,\
      \ with scant knowledge of what, say, an opera house looks and feels like.\n\n\
      It is disheartening to see COG continue to produce, rather than merely host,\
      \ games of this calibre. It simply ought to have transcended uninspiring cut-and-paste\
      \ jobs such as this considering the number of better written, more imaginative,\
      \ less painfully genre-bound titles it has been responsible for of late ('Tally\
      \ Ho', 'Broadway 1849', 'The Superlatives: Aetherfall', to name three very recent\
      \ games). \n\nThis would be forgivable if the price were lowered reasonably\
      \ to reflect the game's length \u2013 I would be disappointed at paying any\
      \ more than \xA32 for this fare, as it is good for nothing other than mindlessly\
      \ passing an hour or so of your life, if you are so inclined. The replay value\
      \ of Undercover Agent is nought, and this is apparent from the very beginning\
      \ of this experience if you are reasonably familiar with COG games. It makes\
      \ one wonder how many players are content to skip over text as a means of hoovering\
      \ up achievements only available via multiple playthroughs. I would hope that\
      \ the audience likely to drive the production of such games to the next level\
      \ have higher standards than that."
