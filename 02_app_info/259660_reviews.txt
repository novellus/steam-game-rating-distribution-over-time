On the first tutorial within seconds my first thought was how horrid the ship reacted to mouse inputs. As I progressed I was bombarded with more and more bizarre key combos and \"shortcuts\". The UI became ever more inept and useless IMO. By the 5th tutorial (which I could not even understand let alone complete) I'd had enough. Uninstall and find another game.\n\nI do not normally have any troubles with games of this kind. So VD is doing something wrong. Sorry to be vague, but other than p-poor UI I can't really give the developers any more feedback that would help them fix things.\n\nIt was just one of those games I disliked at first try, which grew to hate as I persisted.\n\nLooking at other reviews and the forums I am not alone in this opinion.\n\nOf course, others love it - but I say a big \"caveat emptor\" to anyone thinking of buying this!","timestamp_created":1601410198,"timestamp_updated":1605111385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558587491512298584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uoGG3PUCfqLypAI="}
