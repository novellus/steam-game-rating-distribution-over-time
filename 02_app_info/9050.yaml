    review: Even though it is controversial, I really liked this game. I have not
      played the BFG edition so I dont know how this compares, but it is completely
      playable and definitely enjoyable as it is. Its definitely different from all
      the other doom games but that isnt a bad thing and I recommend this to any DOOM
      or shooter fan.
