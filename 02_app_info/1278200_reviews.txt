The ships are somewhat similar between classes of the same type (they do all come from the same tech background, so I give it a pass) but the story missions themselves are fun, and there's randomized missions you can take from stations to improve your standing with them, make extra money, and salvage some loot if you're lucky.  Your pilots all come from the story line, so there's little sense in wandering off the beaten path for more than a few missions until you have all of them.  They also come with their own ships, so you're not scrambling to scrounge up the money for another ship b/c someone invited themselves in!  They also level up and get better as they take more jobs, so there's incentive to bring them along.\n\nPro tip: When one of your pilots (no names for spoilers' sakes) has \"Light 'Em Up\" as an option at the level-up screen, TAKE IT.  It illuminates every enemy position on the map, which is really good for NOT walking your flotilla into an ambush.","timestamp_created":1608927515,"timestamp_updated":1608927515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l7LjzfYCcaGUvQI="}
