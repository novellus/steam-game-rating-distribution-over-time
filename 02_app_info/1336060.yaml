    review: 'Great stories! Great art!


      Protagonist''s characteristic clashed with my own which sometimes annoyed me
      at certain parts, but I enjoyed the game thoroughly regardless. Rich dialogues
      and good sense of humors.


      Compared to ep 1, story style and theme are different (which you can probably
      tell what type they would be based on the opening song). Character''s personalities
      stayed consistent though which is very hard to do, but they did it seamlessly.'
