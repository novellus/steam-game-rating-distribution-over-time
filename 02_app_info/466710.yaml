    review: "[h1]Tatsuyas Route aka the cold heart with a soft, warm inside. [/h1]\n\
      \n[h1]Game overall:[/h1]\n- My only critique is the music, wich becomes boring\
      \ after some loops. \n- CS were good but i would have hoped for more (or i'm\
      \ used to get more of them in other VN/Otome).\n\n+ Other that that the game\
      \ is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed a more western/realistic artstyle\
      \ for once \n+ and the writing was good (both in grammar AND storytelling)\n\
      + the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way. She reacts grumpy when someone\
      \ is rude, shes flustered if its the situation but shes not overly anything.\
      \ The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter wich you shape with your reaktions\
      \ one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this instead of one blunt character!\n\
      \n[h1]This particular Route:[/h1]\n+ over all probably the best / most charming\
      \ execution i've seen of the \"cold harded / jerk to soft hearted / passionate\
      \ guy\"\n+ his jerkness is not overplayed and pretty understandable, i was never\
      \ annoyed by although it sometimes seems rude etc (but in a \"normal\" or \"\
      realistic\" way)\n+ Tatsuya is smart but has flaws, over all a good mix. He\
      \ seems unexperianced in emotional matters and is so far (i did Shinji and Shou\
      \ before) ironicaly the strongest \"teen\" feeling - even though he also seems\
      \ to be the most mature one of the bunch. Its interessting and very well written.\n\
      ++ i really liked the buisseness aspect of things. It was really unexpected\
      \ to actually see something coming out of the buisness club and the family /\
      \ backstory of the Protagonist. I was really happily suprised and am stoked\
      \ to play takus route to put the puzzle together, before starting hikaru!\n\
      +/- i kinda liked that one of the \"bad\" ends isnt actually a bad end but that\
      \ you end up with the rival. I would have liked that it would have been called\
      \ something else (i mean okay, yeah i failed to get to tatsuya but that doesnt\
      \ mean the decisions were wrong no...?) anyhow i would like to see more of this\
      \ in the future!\n-/+ idk why but while it wasnt bad at all, the story seemed\
      \ to drag sometimes. There were twists and tention but even tho i was invested\
      \ in the characters, i observed this. I cant tell why tho, so it might just\
      \ have been a bad day for me personally!\n\n[h1]in short:[/h1] this route was\
      \ absolutely solid. It was a bit trope-y but really balanced so nothing stood\
      \ out negatively (and i am usually very strict with this, so this ia a big positive).\
      \ If you like a lil rough (but not too rough) start that turns into deep feelings,\
      \ this is absolutely it."
