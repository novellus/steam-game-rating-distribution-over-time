    about_the_game: 'Cat &amp; Mouse is a fast paced, asymmetrical, multiplayer game
      where you play a game of well.. cat and mouse.  One team plays as Predators
      and the other team play as the Prey.  Predators hunt the Prey to stop them from
      scoring points and the Prey try to avoid being decimated by their hunters and
      score enough points before the time runs out. <br><br>Cat &amp; Mouse is very
      early in development and many features are temporary or missing at the start
      of Early Access. Currently the game is **ONLY MULTIPLAYER** but this will change
      in the future and the only predator and prey types are cats and mice. As the
      game develops I plan to add more variation to the types of predators and prey
      you can choose from, new game modes and way more levels. Currently the next
      addition to playable characters will be a Predator in the form of an owl and
      a handful of outdoor maps to go along with the owl predator type. <br><br>Thanks
      for playing Cat &amp; Mouse! I seriously appreciate it.<br><br>Join the Discord:
