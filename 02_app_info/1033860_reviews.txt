It seems like somebody's first attempt at making a game/simulator.\nThe graphics are poor, the sounds are annoying, the controls are clunky. \nThere is only one watch movement (I already knew this from reading other reviews but tried anyway), and in places it doesn't even recognize the inputs correctly (pallet bridge screws). If this were more like World of Guns it could be truly great. Instead I regret spending money on this.","timestamp_created":1590712127,"timestamp_updated":1590712127,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44Zn1rvICePfzigI="}
