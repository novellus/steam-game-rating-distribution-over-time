There wasn't much dialogues and the people's 'stories' are somewhat interesting. Audios are definitely disturbing in some cases, however, the horror esthetic is only for show not really all that horrifying. Though if you ask me if it's worth purchasing, well buy it at your own interest.\n","timestamp_created":1606078867,"timestamp_updated":1606078867,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ449Tw+PUCd/f5rwI="}
