    about_the_game: Ratergy is a competitive local multiplayer game for family and
      friends. With its short rounds and its cute rats fighting over a piece of cheese,
      it is a family-friendly and suited for casual gaming.<br><br>The game deliberately

      for and with kids. It is a 2-4 player local multiplayer focusing on playing
      together on a large TV screen or monitor.<br><br>Ratergy offers enough action
      to brighten every party. Through the simple game mechanics and the fast-paced
      combat rounds, it is aimed particularly at occasional players and beginners.
      Expert gamers however have also the opportunity to fight over the cheese dominance
      on a strategic level by using game elements such as conveyor belts and power
      ups. Newbie or advanced player - it is all about the most efficient tactics
      to gather cheese!<h2 class="bb_tag">Game principle</h2>At the beginning of the
      game, every player chooses a rat nest with two rats. By switching the control
      between his rats, the player now tries to be the first to bring 10 pieces of
      cheese to his nest. He can choose between several levels, which offer a variety
      of gaming elements for a more diversified battle over the cheese. The player
      can use conveyer belts to get faster and activate door switches to block the
      way for opposing rats. The usage of power ups such as speed potions, shrinking
      devices and bombs guaranties dynamic combats and a lot of fun!
