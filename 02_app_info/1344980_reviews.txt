While flying through the levels, you might also find cleverly hidden secrets, and special cards that unlock character graphics and concept artworks in the main menu. You can change your weapon by collecting fruits from special dispensers - there are a total of 9 different fruits/weapons, each one also having an alternative fire mode, ranging from spreads to mines.\n\nThe only minor thing I've noticed while playing is that the wall collision is a bit weak on the corners, and it's easy to fly outside the level bounds, but it's also equally easy to go back, so it's not that annoying. \n\nIf you like twinstick shooters, and need a quick burst of adrenaline every now and then, you can't go wrong with Gunpig!","timestamp_created":1606576950,"timestamp_updated":1606576950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr9nch/YCdr7EtAI="}
