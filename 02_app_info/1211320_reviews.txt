Unfortunately, there are too many bugs. There is a problem with double clicking: Sometimes the character starts to run (as is the intention), sometimes not.  After the third episode the game goes back to the map, without any options to go forward, so that's it for the game. Support from the devs is slow.\nGot a nice mail from the devs to apologize, but apparently they haven't got much time.","timestamp_created":1580043010,"timestamp_updated":1581014780,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583222031593322754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1581010974,"developer_response":"Hi verelstr, we care. \nThanks for the useful feedback and apologies for the late reply.\nWe're glad that you liked the emphasis on the environment and plot.
