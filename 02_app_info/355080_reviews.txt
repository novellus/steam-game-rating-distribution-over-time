This game has so many fundamental problems with it, it doesn't deserve your time. I try to match people to the game and the genre type, and go with its strengths, but there is no match here. I'm sorry, there's too many problems with the game at a fundamental level. Yeah, it looks nice, but not only are there ridiculously bad controls that are really hard to work with, but there was bugs all over the place. Just avoid. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  http://youtu.be/UzMZKwijtYs\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The ideas?\n[*]The art is not bad.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Controls are floaty and abysmal because of it. Needed precision is unobtainable. It makes the game literally unplayable.\n[*]Obvious Mobile Design game is obvious.\n[*]Does not save options like audio levels.\n[*]Game can exit with one single button push without prompting with escape key. \n[*]QA did not exist. Bugs all over the place. Was able to be in the options menu and kept on playing. \n[*]Nothing stands out about game design.\n[*]Sound and music loops get old rather quickly\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1428075763,"timestamp_updated":1557408827,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546638786792755127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ455izzuoCf8/3OQ=="}
