I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. \n\nIt start off as a copy of the first trial from a certain Ace Attorney game, and yet, it still try to differentiate itself from it. \n\nI really like the variety in choices you can do, to the point of completely overthrowing the trial for a fat stack of cash. \n\nIt sure isn't the most intellectual game, characters sounds quite stupid at times, but I feel like it's quite well written  (especially compared to other free visual novels on steam...) and it's highly enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1488010267,"timestamp_updated":1488010267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559180557727813721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l9mUutoCdviGcw=="}
