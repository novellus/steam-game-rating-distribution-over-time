    review: 'The sense of speed in this game is great. The handling of the vehicles
      seems weird at first but once you get used to the drifting and the boost recharging
      mechanics they control really well. Amazing visuals and fitting music all throughout
      the game. I really love this kind of racer, I also approve of the added hardcore
      mode that encourages you to go as fast as you can without dying.

      I am probably going to start speedrunning this game, it really is a gem 10/10
      would recommend especially for that price.'
