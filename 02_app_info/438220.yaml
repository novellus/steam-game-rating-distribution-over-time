    review: "I waited to see if the developer was going to bring any more episodes\
      \ out and then I could play it all in one but after waiting 2 and a half years\
      \ I gave up.\nThe game is ok I was a bit disapointed with the graphics as they\
      \ dont look anything like the screen shot quality we see on the steam page also\
      \ if you walk to close to a barrel or street furniture even a candle it will\
      \ stop you.\nAnd the music wasnt all that medieval so you didnt feel like you\
      \ was in a medieval setting.\nI will recommend the game as I hope they finish\
      \ the game and if they polish this one I will happily play through it againplus\
      \ it is at the right price of \xA32.00.\nIf you still want a medieval stealth\
      \ fix I recommend Shadwen it is very good."
