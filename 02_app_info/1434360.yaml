    about_the_game: Hello!<br><br>Welcome to the Knight Club + Demo Version page!
      This is like the full version of Knight Club +, except with less stuff, so that
      you can try the game and decide to buy the rest of it. Please enjoy. Or don't!
      I'm not going to tell you what to do. Just like I'm not going to tell you to
      buy the game (it is super cheap) to get access to the following:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>All 14 Playable Characters<br></li><li>online Play<br></li><li>Achievements<br></li><li>A
      deep sense of accomplishment for supporting The Little Guy (me).</li></ul><br>It's
      a fun game. If you want to know more, check out the store page for the full
      game. It has all kinds of details that I didn't feel like copy/pasting on this
      page. Also, I think maybe you are more likely to buy the game if you go to that
      page? Could be true!
