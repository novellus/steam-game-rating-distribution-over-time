The visuals are flat and boring and when you pick something up they get a metallic sheen or rainbow effect. The mechanics are literally walk, look around and interact.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay of Djilyaro is immediately as boring as it sounds. You walk slowly through a badly textured world until you find collectibles that make the world trippy. Admittedly and a definite unintentional analogy for real life, everything gets so trippy that it's hard finding the normal among the insane. Then, after being surprised out of nowhere by a flashy object and a loud jump-scare scream you get send to a vast and empty city I couldn't find anything to do in that had very ominous music I was on edge for the rest of that 'attempt'. Which eventually lead to me going back to the menu to reset the game and again more of the flashy dudes showed up. My only guess is that Djilyaro has the intention to be a Slender-like game where you pick up collectibles and don't get caught but the flashy things always hunt you down and move faster than you can making this a guess without a definite answer and that getting caught just sends you to time-wasting limbo.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe soundtrack, as far as it's there did make at least an impact on me, but for the wrong reasons. After a jump-scare then getting ominous music obviously puts you on edge, but the area you are sent to is just emptiness making it unease without reason unlike fridge horror.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSo in conclusion, I would personally not recommend Djilyaro, I kid you not however when I say that the weirdness of this game does set a poignant tone of unease and 'mood' but at the speed you walk and the vastness without guidance of this game and just how unfair it is. Djilyaro couldn't keep my attention and as there is no saving or no real explanation of an objective, you have to do whatever it is you do in one go so I personally wouldn't recommend this game. It is however very cheap so do give it a look for yourself!\n\n[h1]Associated Media[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341864621","timestamp_created":1609333848,"timestamp_updated":1609333848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Lbx2fYCc9TivgI="}
