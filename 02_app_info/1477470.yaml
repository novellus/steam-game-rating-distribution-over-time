    about_the_game: "Relentless: Ranger is a fantasy rogue-lite action platformer.\
      \ Slash, shoot, sneak, die, and repeat as the next strider to brave the impossible\
      \ mission. You play the Rangers of Anorien, who must find the last Seed of the\
      \ Goddess Tree within the heartland of evil before all is lost. Each ranger\
      \ lives once. Once he dies, you must select another to attempt the quest.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nEXCEPTIONAL SOUL-LIKE COMBAT<br />\r\nBows, swords, spears,\
      \ and spells. Use a variety of weapons and magic to overcome your opposition\
      \ in tough but fair combat. Beware that brainless button mashing will get you\
      \ nowhere fast. You must also utilize dodges, jumps, and impeccable timing if\
      \ you hope to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE TICKING CLOCK<br />\r\nIn a land\
      \ where the Dark God reigns, not only are the odds stacked heavily against you,\
      \ you must complete the quest in a limited time. With each passing day a ranger\
      \ spends, the Dark becomes more powerful until the challenge becomes inevitably\
      \ insurmountable. Will you spend extra time to heal in town? Or will you trudge\
      \ on to save time and hope you get lucky?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRANGER SUPERPOWERS<br\
      \ />\r\nTwelve disciplines to train from Archery to Beastmastery to Druidic\
      \ magic. Combined with inherent talents and flaws, each ranger will play differently.\
      \ Perhaps you will pick a Legolas-like archer of death who can plow through\
      \ levels through sheer arrow power? Or select one who relies more on stealth\
      \ and magic? Or another who relies on the aid of forest animals?<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nSURVIVAL MANAGEMENT<br />\r\nRescue villagers, find artifacts, or just\
      \ invest money in the town. You will be rewarded with better weapons, more potions,\
      \ and beds with less fleas. Help make the town a better place and the mission\
      \ less unreasonable, if not for you, at least for your successors.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nCHOOSE YOUR OWN PATH<br />\r\nChoices matter in addition to the procedural\
      \ generation of fate. Each ranger will encounter different people and situations\
      \ during his quest. Depending on your choices, his subsequent path will be altered,\
      \ taking him to new locations, dangers, and treasures. Although all seek the\
      \ Seed, no ranger will travel the same path."
