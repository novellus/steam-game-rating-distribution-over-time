    review: "Short, easy, and inexpensive HOG. No cards or achievements so far. Lots\
      \ of \"trace this figure without crossing an used line\" type puzzles. The graphics\
      \ are pretty without being lavish (hello Artifex) and the HOG scenes are not\
      \ difficult except for when language issues arise, using hairbrush instead of\
      \ comb for example. The last part of the game has you solve riddles to access\
      \ areas AND to figure which item to find in the HOG scene, a rather enjoyable\
      \ change of pace. There is no bonus content, but it's only @$5.00, which is\
      \ very economical nowadays (hello again Artifex, and hi Big Fish.)\n\nThe story\
      \ is pretty standard and shallow, as is the norm in HOGs. One plot point I'm\
      \ not sure of could be due to a translation error ...or did they really [spoiler]\
      \ imply the Crow Witch was not just the Feline Wizard's sister but his love\
      \ also (before their transformation?!) If so, WOW, HOG's are getting rather\
      \ telenovela! xD  [/spoiler] \n\nSo a 7/10 due to no cards, cheevs, or bonus\
      \ content."
