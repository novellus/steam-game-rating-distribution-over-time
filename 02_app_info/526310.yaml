      Game developed by Apeirogon Games. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, the game features
      a unique story in an alternate reality Earth where you take control of Jim Grayson,
      a homicide detective hunting an as yet unknown serial killer whose motives are
      confusingly unclear.<h2 class="bb_tag">&quot;It's like an old-school Point and

      Silhouette has not been rated by any software ratings board, It is <strong><u>intended
