    review: "After playing and enjoying \"From Head to Toe\" and \"A Lozenge,\" I\
      \ decided to go back and try the first Steam release from developer Party of\
      \ Introverts. I'd looked at the Steam page before, but the description never\
      \ grabbed me. \n\nAfter playing it, though, I'm glad I did. Thing-in-Itself\
      \ explores an idea I've heard a few different ways before - once by Kim Krizan\
      \ in Richard Linklater's film \"Waking Life,\" and again in a statement I've\
      \ read that's been attributed to both Ana\xEFs Nin and the Talmud: \"We don't\
      \ see things as they are...we see things as we are.\" Although I've studied\
      \ some philosophy, I don't remember explicitly reading Kant - perhaps I should?\n\
      \nEven so, I very much appreciated the way that Party for Introverts illustrated\
      \ the idea through a game, depicting a deteriorating relationship - something\
      \ familiar to many. The game has fitting music, and excellent voice acting that\
      \ brings Molly & Ted to life.\n\nThe only con, for me, was the insistence that\
      \ I contact Molly upon the [spoiler] death of my fish. I felt that she had made\
      \ it clear that she was not interested in hearing from Ted, and I wanted to\
      \ respect that. Ted instead created an awkward situation that only served to\
      \ bring pain to both parties. [/spoiler] However, you live, you learn. And although\
      \ Thing-in-Itself is a game that gives you a certain degree of agency, Party\
      \ for Introverts has a specific story they'd like to tell."
