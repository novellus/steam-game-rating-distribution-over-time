In this one the robots have a quite erratic and different bvehavior, the platforms are slippery, you cant' jump through doors (try jumping passing trought the elevator! I always loved to do that). The graphics are fuzzy and everything sounds fake. The chessboard game have strange sounds and they could have at least added the mouse functionality! Total shame, the original was way better than this.","timestamp_created":1609181184,"timestamp_updated":1609181184,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIir1fYCeKGYvgI="}
