    review: 'I''ve played quite a few hidden object games, enjoying the puzzles and
      their casual nature. I''ve found that some are good, some are mediocre and some
      are bad, but Hidden Fears doesn''t even qualify as the latter.


      A recently married couple is lured to a hotel for their honeymoon, only for
      the wife to be abducted shortly after their arrival. The husband has to explore
      the eerie building, solve puzzles and battle ghosts in order to find and free
      her.


      First off, I do like the ghostly atmosphere of the creepy hotel, as well as
      the horror-themed story. The artwork looks pretty good too and the music does
      add to the ambiance. But that''s about where the enjoyability ended for me,
      though. What follows is only a selections of the problems I encountered while
      playing.


      The game controls are clunky to say the least. For example, during a mini-game
      near the start of the game a metal ball has to be guided through a maze using
      the cursor keys. Occasionally a bomb goes of inside the maze (always near the
      ball) and if the ball is inside the blast radius it will return to its starting
      point. Due to the unresponsive controls it was nearly impossible to avoid the
      blast, as the ball would regularly stop moving or not even start moving when
      pressing a cursor key. After several failed and frustrating attempts I was forced
      to skip the mini-game (something I don''t like doing and don''t often do) in
      order to progress the story.


      Some of descriptions of the mini-games state that there is a time limit to winning
      the game but no timer is shown, making it impossible to know how long you have
      left. Would it have hurt the developers to give the player an on-screen indication
      of the remaining time? Also, the description often only tell you the goal of
      mini-game without explaining anything about the controls or mechanics of the
      game.


      During the tutorial a clock was visible in the top-left of the screen, for some
      inexplicable reason measuring how long I took. In itself not a big deal, but
      whenever it ticked (i.e. every second) the game, or at least the mouse cursor,
      would freeze, making it difficult to accurately point at anything. Fortunately
      the timer disappeared after the tutorial was over, along with the annoying freezing
      every second.


      Voice acting in games like these is often not great, which I understand and
      accept, but in this one it is abysmal. Not only does it seem as if the actors
      are simply reading from a sheet of paper, they also sound as if they''d rather
      be doing something else. Things are only aggravated by the badly written dialogue.


      At one point a few lines of subtitles during a cutscene didn''t disappear from
      the screen, causing them to make the following lines unreadable. After the cutscene
      finished they still remained on top of the inventory bar. Quitting to the main
      menu and reloading the game fixed this, but it shouldn''t have happened to begin
      with.


      Loading times when switching rooms are much longer than such a relatively simple
      game justifies, which can get very annoying when backtracking is involved. I
      read other reviews which mentioned loading times between 10 and 30 seconds,
      but fortunately I was spared that.


      As usual the game automatically pauses when alt-tabbing out of the game. However,
      upon returning the game wouldn''t unpause, despite the on-screen message telling
      me to "Click the screen to resume the game". Also, during one of the mini-games
      the game crashed to desktop.


      I think that Hidden Fears has the potential to be a pretty decent horror-themed
      hidden object game. However, the problems I encountered while playing just kept
      piling up, and after the game crashed on me somewhere during chapter 3 I decided
      that enough was enough. I may never find out if Tony will be able to save his
      wife from a bunch of ghosts and lunatics, or if he''ll become one of them. But
      frankly I just don''t care anymore.


      My advice is to only buy this if you''re a fan of hidden object games with a
      spooky atmosphere, don''t mind the occasional crash and horrible voice acting
      and other issues mentioned above, [b]and[/b] it is offered at a major discount.
      Otherwise, stay away from this one.'
