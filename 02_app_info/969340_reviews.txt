I am in my late 50's and my first dungeon game i played was Wizardry 1 on a 48K  Apple Computer back in the early 80's and this game stole alot of hours of my life. Followed by Ultima and then the FTL Games \"Dungeon Master & Chaos Strike Back\" on a Amiga.  Now its years later and many Dungeon games later this game peaked my interest. It brings back the old flavor of Turn Based Dungeon Crawler but with a Tactical Turn Based Maneuvers,  I am glad i purchased this game and cant wait for it be finished.  looking forward to see how they develop the combat system further and how the Ai on the advanced monsters will look also.","timestamp_created":1604165504,"timestamp_updated":1604165504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwOHtv/UCdr6tqwI="}
