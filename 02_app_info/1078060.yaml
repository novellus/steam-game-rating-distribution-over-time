    review: "(English_Fran\xE7ais review)\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37930390-Mia-Curations/]My\
      \ Curations[/url]\n\nENGLISH:\nA short tale, 10-15 minutes long and semi-linear,\
      \ because some choices give you quick endings and there is only one path to\
      \ follow to know the true end of the story. The music is nice. The pictures\
      \ are in the same style as BRG's Red Riding Hood. Designed with Visual Novel\
      \ Maker. Simple chivos to have, for the 100% hunters. The dubbing (voice of\
      \ the narrator) is more pleasant than Red Riding Hood's, but as I read quickly,\
      \ I mutated it. :) \n\nFrench version available.\n\nFRAN\xC7AIS:\nUn court conte,\
      \ d\u2019une dur\xE9e de 10-15 minutes et semi-lin\xE9aire, car certains choix\
      \ vous donnent des fins rapides et il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul chemin \xE0\
      \ suivre pour connaitre la v\xE9ritable fin de l\u2019histoire. La musique est\
      \ sympathique. Les images sont du m\xEAme style que celles de BRG\u2019s Red\
      \ Riding Hood. Con\xE7u avec Visual Novel Maker. Succ\xE8s simple \xE0 avoir,\
      \ pour les chasseurs de succ\xE8s. Le doublage (voix du narrateur) est plus\
      \ agr\xE9able que celui de Red Riding Hood, mais comme je lis rapidement, je\
      \ l\u2019ai mut\xE9. :) \n\nVersion fran\xE7aise disponible."
