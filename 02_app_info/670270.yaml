    review: "Instructional signs are not in english.  Not a deal breaker since the\
      \ game is fairly straight forward.  However, this game is not very well optimized\
      \ so will not be the nicest experience on lower-end VR systems.  \n\nStill,\
      \ can I really complain for the price?  And, knowing me, I probably even bought\
      \ it on sale for a dollar or less.  Seems fun when you're in the mood for this\
      \ type of game (arcade shooter?).  If it runs on your system smoothly enough,\
      \ it's a decent enough game to pick up."
