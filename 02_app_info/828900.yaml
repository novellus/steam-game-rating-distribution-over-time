    short_description: A quiet game of life and loss. One by one, everyone left the
      village for the city. Everyone, except Talma. Approaching her final years, she
      maintains a simple way of life tending to her homestead, surviving, subsisting,
      whilst increasingly disturbing letters arrive from her family in the city.
