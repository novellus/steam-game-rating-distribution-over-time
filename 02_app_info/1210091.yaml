    review: "I'm primarily writing this since I noticed there's no reviews for this\
      \ mode yet, which is pretty surprising to me.  (Also I failed to mention this\
      \ and the Story/Campaign/Arcade modes in my full review.)\n\nI really am having\
      \ a great time with this mode so far.  You have the double flippers like Time\
      \ Machine (SS) and hitting the sets of drop targets is very important (like\
      \ Time Machine) and you might even say the long shots for missile fire is also\
      \ like Time Machine's past mode.  All these comparisons are certainly not a\
      \ riff on the table because I quite love Time Machine.  There's also a lot of\
      \ ways to freeze/burn/gas/tornado the Zombies.  The fun thing about this mode\
      \ that no real table can offer (probably any time soon if ever) is the Zombies\
      \ that will spawn and walk down the table and, yes, the ball bounces off them\
      \ and can damage them.  This makes for some panicked gameplay of trying to dodge\
      \ zombies to get to the targets you want or panic smacking them a bunch of times\
      \ with the ball because the gunners helping you ran out of ammo (the drop targets).\
      \  \n\nI think it's a nice break from normal pinball and worth the money.  The\
      \ only people that should probably avoid this are ones who want a serious table\
      \ and don't want to have silly fun and get mad at those stupid Zombies always\
      \ getting in the way of the ball.  I personally got it as part of the Platinum\
      \ bundle but I also didn't really wait long to decide to buy that.  I wouldn't\
      \ have been mad if I bought this full price before the bundle."
