While it is portrayed as a horror game, there are only a few jump-scares in it. It is for the most part a good thriller verging on horror. I don't particularly like scaring myself, so take it from me; don't worry about the horror-part. I've played quite a few other puzzle games, as well as Hidden Object Games, and found this to rank near the top. It is not unlike the first Enigmatis game, but a lot better. Can't wait for Part 3.","timestamp_created":1610131341,"timestamp_updated":1610131341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47M/T8fYCe7jNwQI="}
