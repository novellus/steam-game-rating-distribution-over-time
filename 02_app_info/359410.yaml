    review: 'Its a movie that will more than likely take a few rewatch and even then
      im not sure ill be able to accurately give a summary of it or even explain it.
      It is strange, but in the current ''rehash and remake'' hollowood style, I''ll
      take a strange movie im not sure i ''get'' anytime over a ''transformer 5: the
      return of the Objectified female robot with explosions''.


      Recommended if you feel like being confused and weirded out, or more likely
      challenged, which arguably, we all do sometimes.
