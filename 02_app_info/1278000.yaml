    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my skit review\
      \ here (I use only the game to do the review): https://youtu.be/6CQuSySLAyo\n\
      \nI do recommend this app. I know there's Mindshow VR, which I absolutely loved,\
      \ except now it's gone offline (they promise to come back someday). There's\
      \ also Flipside Studio, which is still online and free. So this app isn't exactly\
      \ anything new, except it's geared towards educators. In fact, it is free to\
      \ educators. \n\nHowever, the rest of us can purchase it on the Steam store\
      \ and I'm proud to support it. It's a useful tool. I've already had fun playing\
      \ around with it. You can act the fool as Mark Twain, Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin\
      \ Franklin, Harriet Tubman, Tecumseh, George Washington Carver, Abigail Adams,\
      \ and Sonia Sotomayor. \n\nThere are things that I do hope improve or are added.\
      \ I do hope they make it easier to delete takes that you didn't like. I also\
      \ wish there were more characters, props, and environments. Lastly, it would\
      \ be great to have the ability to have multiple characters on screen that you\
      \ could act out. In fact, even better would be the ability to have online multiplayer\
      \ for group projects with those multiple characters. \n\nIt's running on the\
      \ Unity Engine. It ran fine for me on my 1060 GTX. The video exports were fast\
      \ and easy (I just wish they were mp4 versus webm). I did not experience any\
      \ issues. Anyways, I'm happy to support developers who made this free to educators.\
      \ I hope many teachers take advantage of this tool. It sounds like something\
      \ that would be very fun for the classroom.\n\n[i]Please note: This did NOT\
      \ work on Windows Mixed Reality[/i]"
