    review: Killer Klownz is definitely worth the purchase, especially for $1.99.
      Even though this is a wave shooter, it is VERY high energy and the clown (klown?)
      textures look pretty good, especially up close. Killer Klownz is going to get
      your heartrate up and is a good value for a $1.99.
