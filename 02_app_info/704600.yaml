      (that's me!), the creator of Ersatz.<br><br>My love of music and more specifically
      game music has left a big impression on me as a person. To have this opportunity
      to not only make a complete game on my own, but also this accompanying soundtrack,
      is immensely exciting.<br><br>With the music being such a big part of the experience
      of Ersatz, it was necessary to create it in a way wherein it could dynamically
      progress at any moment, whilst matching the tone and setting of what was happening
      on screen. However, it was also very important to me that taken out of that
      context of play, it was still just good music. I really hope you enjoy the end
