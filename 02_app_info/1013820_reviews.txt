Their voice actors are phenomenal, art style is gorgeous, and inclusivity abounds in ways I have never seen in other games. Stars and Snowdrops is no exception. It has features for the hard of hearing, plenty of save slots, loveable cute characters, an asexual ending, and body and skin type diversity for the player to easily project while still having choices that are varied but in character - it is incredible.\n\nA short, sweet, and cute story that brilliantly showcases what you can expect from Ithaqua Labs. Bravo, I'll be waiting for more!","timestamp_created":1607696010,"timestamp_updated":1607696010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwscmJqfYCcIKNuQI="}
