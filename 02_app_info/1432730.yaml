    review: "For the time being, this game feels mostly Like an Ipad game, with lack\
      \ of functions. Its fairly new, and at start its kinda fun to play, but it just\
      \ gets the same random events, and gameplay after an hour just feels like it\xB4\
      s not really worth it. Perhaps later stages in Development will fix it. So will\
      \ probably come back to play later"
