It's cheap and i'd say rather short. You have to drag your cursor to wear you want to go then let of it once youre ready. Its mainly about timing and percision. the higher the level the harder it is. Ive played for 14 mins so far and im already on level 27/50. there is a cool trick that works sometimes where you can drag the thing off the map and sometimes (worked like twice lol) your car would disappear then come back. If your car is anywhere touching the [P] then you should be alright and will pass. fairly easy. i wwould recommend only because price is low and like, i guess you get what you pay for :shrug: . im not going to give it a negative review because honestly theres nothing like...wrong with the game. And its kinda cute ngl. would be cool if they made a new game where you were actually driving like first person.","timestamp_created":1608172184,"timestamp_updated":1608172184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnISit/YCdeHrugI="}
