Currently no servers up, but the p2p netcode is surprisingly good, no problems at all from one side of the US to the other when hosting games,. We even had some dudes from Australia and Thailand playing in my game last night and they were still having fun despite having a 200+ ping connection. This game is shaping up to be an awesome game to play with your friends, and the capture the ball mode is awesome!\n\n早期アクセスでもとても楽しいゲームです。メカニックが他のAFPSと唯一ですし、とても速いし、簡単なゲームです。このゲームはおすすめです。　d(^_^o)","timestamp_created":1576002788,"timestamp_updated":1576002788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqsPF+O4Ce7W44wE="}
