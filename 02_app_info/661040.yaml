    reviews: "\u201C\u2026I did enjoy the fact that some of the objects are well-blended\
      \ within pictures and can be easily missed. The ability to zoom in and out is\
      \ nice and can be helpful to spot objects\u2026 If you manage to clear a stage\
      \ super-fast, you\u2019ll be rewarded with three stars for that level and will\
      \ receive a great numbers of points. If you find objects within a certain time\
      \ limit (we are talking seconds here), points will multiply very quickly, which\
      \ will give you a chance to show your name in the leader board section. So make\
      \ sure to spot all the objects before you start your round.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      \ discosta leggermente dai tradizionali giochi Hidden Objects, ed in questo\
      \ caso possiamo dire in modo interessante. Alcuni degli oggetti sono mimetizzati\
      \ davvero molto bene, e vi costringeranno ad usare tutti gli strumenti a disposizione,\
      \ come lo zoom e la possibilit\xE0 di spostare l\u2019immagine nelle 4 direzioni.\
      \ Complessivamente, nonostante la quasi assenza di una trama, Time Trap potrebbe\
      \ piacere agli appassionati del genere. Una colonna sonora piacevole da ascoltare\
      \ accompagna la risoluzione di rompicapi un po' staccati tra loro, privi di\
      \ linearit\xE0, ma comunque stimolanti. Il punteggio ed un simil-multiplayer\
      \ con classifiche giocatori invogliano a ripetere pi\xF9 volte il singolo scenario\
      \ anche a distanza di tempo, allungando il gameplay di qualche ora.\u201D<br><a\

    review: 'Time trap is a very atmospheric hidden object game with good graphics
      and storyline.

      There are achievements, localization, and an unusual hint system.

      I recommend it !'
