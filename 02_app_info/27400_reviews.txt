Like the game starts out enjoyable, interesting and you're enjoying yourself but then you get entangled in another mystery. The first one regards the mail order catalog but after you save Max, you go into this whole plot with pogo sticks. Then, after that, there is ANOTHER plot and it just becomes a bit confusing. It's also hard to stay invested because of the mini games and I feel like getting the good end is next to impossible. \n\nI don't know, it's hard to replay this game just because it gets really boring really fast.","timestamp_created":1604918090,"timestamp_updated":1604918090,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkdOk1vUCf4mprQI="}
