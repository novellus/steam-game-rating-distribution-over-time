But don’t lose your attention because weather might be cruel here. You are going to experience tsunami and floods, earthquake with rockfall, and even a deadly tornado! It’s really hard to drive as there are lots of sharp corners, cliffs and impassable roads.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Maximal Scenarios variety<\/h2>There are three types of scenarios:      <br><br>1. Standard scenarios about driving people to their destination.<br>2. Scenarios with breakdowns. You’ll have to deal with different problems such as faulty steering, and this is while trying to take sharp turns. But sometimes terrain can even help you, for example when you have to turn off the engine while driving off cliffs to save some fuel.<br>3. Disasters, from explosion on Chernobyl Power Plant to wildfires, earthquakes and tornadoes. You’ll always have to keep an eye on tornado in order not to end up going straight into it. It’s even more difficult when you’re driving on extremely bad road where you can easily puncture a tire by driving over bump at high speed. After the Chernobyl Power Plant disaster, help liquidators to find the most radiation poisoned spots in Red Forest. But never forget that large radiation dose can be deadly for you.<br>These and many other interesting situations will be available to be played!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Earn experience, unlock new scenarios, buses and upgrades<\/h2>You will get experience, which levels you up, for completing each scenario.
