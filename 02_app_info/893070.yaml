    review: "This game has a review period limitation set to discourage negative commits,\
      \ so if you are having difficulty posting a review that is why.  Published 2018\
      \ with only a handful of reviews?  \n\nWant a validation of the quality of this\
      \ game? = Look at the duration of gameplay from each review.\n\n[B] [u]This\
      \ does not constitute a game.[/u] [/B]  I did not play for an hour.  I adjusted\
      \ the settings for 20 minutes, finished the \"sample concept\" in 15, and tried\
      \ to find anything else appealing the remainder of the time.  This is what happens\
      \ when a content developer tries to create a game by themselves.  Beautiful\
      \ dystopian playfields, poor environmental & character interactions, and zero\
      \ replay potential.  The game is so short you will be scratching your head as\
      \ to why it on Steam in the first place.\n\nI wanted to believe that it had\
      \ to be a proof of concept or a kick starter because no one would call this\
      \ an actual game, but then I have read enough to know this is the intentional\
      \ finished product.  What little was made, is stunning and beautiful but a game\
      \ is more then just a nice back drop.  It should present some challenges and\
      \ have a storyline that does not just stop abruptly because the developers gave\
      \ up.\n\n[b]Here is to hoping that this is a prelude to better games, but as\
      \ it is I cannot recommend this one. [/b]\n[i]Reason = Price does not equal\
      \ the content.  Refer to other commits for more detail. [/i]"
