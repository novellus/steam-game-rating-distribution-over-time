    review: I would 100% not recommend this to anyone experiencing any sort of mental
      illness or trauma- it will seriously make you feel sick. This is the most disturbing
      VN/game I have ever read, and I wish I stopped reading it sooner than 4 hours
      in. It probably seems ridiculous to say this about a VN featuring axolotl characters,
      but I'm dead serious.
