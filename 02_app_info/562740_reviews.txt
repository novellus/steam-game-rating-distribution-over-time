I just can't recommend this game. There isn't enough here. You can beat the game on normal in about 10 minutes. There's also hell mode, which is just more zombies. I know it's only $1.99 USD and I bought it on sale for only .99 cents, but Zombie Town VR is basically a demo you're paying for. \n\nIf those were a great 10 minutes of gameplay, I could maybe recommend it anyways, but it's more of a mixed bag. There are a good variety of zombies; there's exploding, freezing, gas, & healing zombies, among other enemy types. And there's also different weapons at your disposal, including a fire & ice gun, plus a shield.\n\nHowever, it's not polished enough for so little content. There are no settings whatsoever and the music is just a bit too loud for my taste. Also, guns just don't feel good to shoot. It seems like your starter gun is better than your special guns. Later on, the only difficulty is the sheer amount of zombies on the screen and the fact that the bigger zombies take longer to kill. There's also these little bugs like the shield not spawning correctly on your hand or not being able to switch weapons at times.\n\nThe game does run smoothly (I got steady 90 FPS on my 1060 GTX). While, I had no issues on WMR, on the Oculus Rift it does automatically shoot without any input (don't have to press trigger). You can play this game seated. Kids might enjoy this game.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. I could maybe recommend this to families with kids, but otherwise, I would pass on this one.
