Use either two-handed melee weapons to whack other players or sneakily shoot down their karts, all while trying to cross the finish line in first place.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1159860\/extras\/next_level_D.gif?t=1609263257\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wide Range Of Control Options<\/h2>Enjoy a next-level racing experience with Super Immersive control.
