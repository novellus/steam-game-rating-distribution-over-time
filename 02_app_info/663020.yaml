    review: The game sais the roomspace required is 2m x 2m mine is 2m x 2.5m and
      the steering wheel is out of reach unless im reaching over my couch thats past
      my set boundries. the game is simple fun for the first 30 mins but its just
      the same thing over and over. cannons are glitchy from time to time and sometimes
      dont close. With some bug fixes and a way to allow smaller play areas to reach
      the steerting wheel and mabye multiplayer would make the game a lot better but
      right now its got lots of bugs. overall i give it a 2/10
