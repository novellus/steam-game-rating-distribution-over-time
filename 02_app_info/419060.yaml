    about_the_game: From Julian Gollop, the designer of the original, award-winning
      <strong>XCOM</strong> game comes <i>Chaos Reborn</i> - a turn-based wizard combat
      game with single player Realm Quests and many online options. Between 2 and
      6 players can challenge each other to magical duels in a variety of arenas using
      a spell deck of interesting spells and creatures - including the Gooey Blob,
      Shadow Wood, and more. There is a monthly league system and several game modes
      with live or asynchronous battles. You can explore the Realms of Chaos fighting
      Wizard Lords and Kings, and invite players to join you in co-op battles, or
      act as an invader in someone else's realm. These Realms can be designed by player
      Wizard Kings and rated by other players.
