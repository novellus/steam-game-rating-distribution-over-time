    review: "So, on a lark, I searched for Klax and up came Stax. After my initial\
      \ confusion, I bought it without hesitation - it was only 2 bucks.\n\nI loved\
      \ Klax. I played it in the arcade back in the 90's and I had it for original\
      \ Xbox on some game compilation. I remember being pretty good at it. I miss\
      \ that game and this \"spiritual successor\" is a pretty faithful replication.\
      \ \n\nIt is not super professional - besides resolution, I'm not sure if the\
      \ graphics are really any better. I am slightly colorblind and have trouble\
      \ seeing the difference between the green and the yellow, but that's not their\
      \ fault. I feel like the tiles/board are a little too narrow.\n\nThe game plays\
      \ very well with a controller.\n\nI thank the developers for making this available.\
      \ I wish we had a real port or official update from whomever owns the rights\
      \ nowadays but I am very thankful that this is here on the Steam store and very\
      \ cheap. I definitely spent more thatn $2 on this game on a daily basis at the\
      \ arcade back in Chicago."
