Creator is also super responsive when needed. The Underground DLC was a bit of a letdown, as it felt very \"trial and error\" compared to how the base game felt, but part of that probably stems from waiting so long for the DLC to arrive. Some of the puzzles I honestly brute forced my way through because of the lack of depth. Just kept pushing forward until it worked haha, but most of the puzzles were fantastic, especially in the base game! Highly recommend this for anyone looking to have a relaxing time solving puzzles.\n\nAnd to the creator: If you're planning on making more games, please add me on Steam so I can know about any future releases or possible updates for this game.","timestamp_created":1606788306,"timestamp_updated":1606788306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxfqCjvYCe/OVtgI="}
