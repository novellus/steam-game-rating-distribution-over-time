This is mostly due to the complete lack of AI players.\nIf you have two friends over to play, you will be unable to all play together as you can't play any form of 2 vs 1 with one person having a computer team mate. Also the 1 v 1 is very limited in play as you have no team mate on your side to work with. So really this game is only good fun if you have 4 people who can play.\nThere is no form of single player what so ever! No way for you to practice on your own etc.\nJust imagine getting a tennis game where there was no computer players, [b]NONE![/b]  This is what Mowin' & Throwin' feels like.\n\nIf at some point AI gets added I will change my review. But as of now I would really not recommend this game.\nIf they added a simple AI to fill out teams and an ability to switch and take control of your team mate like switching players in most sports games then I think this could be very good.\nBut as of now, being really a game that is either 4 human players or nothing, it is bad.","timestamp_created":1564835635,"timestamp_updated":1565350369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587046205997467041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47uKJu+wCf8LUzwE="}
