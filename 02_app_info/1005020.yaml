      \ in Group B rally. When Group B was disbanded in 1986, many of the Delta S4s\
      \ that had been in competition were quickly repurposed for rallycross. Drivers\
      \ like Matti Alam\xE4ki heavily modified the car, optimising it for the sprint\
      \ format that is synonymous with rallycross."
