I was hoping with the disappearance & then reappearance of this route within the last year or so - that it was finally going to be fixed. But it's back in the Steam Store in Feb 2018, still with its bugs.  When it's eventually fixed, I will happily update this review to say what a great little route - however, until then the below still applies:[/i]\n\n\nShocking that it is still for sale in its current state, with known bugs.  And unbelievably so, since its very release approx 7 years ago (was 4 at time of this initial review!). From the word go, a couple of the scenarios have been kaput; simply because of careless programming of the numbering of wagons that need collecting in various tasks. This makes the scenarios immediately impossible to complete because the wagons don't match the intruction briefing task list. The problems with the route have been further compounded by the fact, that the release of the TS2015 version of the game appears to have broken the moving ballast loader i.e. it's no longer possible to fill your wagons with stones.  Which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the route delivering stone aggregate from one end of the route to the other!\n\nAs others have pointed out the constant defeaning echo caused by a faulty track EFX is not only unpleasant to listen to, it drowns out all the other sounds in the route. The route is very short, single track, and has painfully low maximum speed limits (not that the shunter would allow much more anyway, it's underpowered for the route; a Class 08 would fit the bill far better), resulting in complete painful tedium travelling from end to end along the route.\n\nThe positives, well the Class 04 shunter is a nicely designed & attractive RailWorks model, and the same can be said of the catfish ballast wagons. They would be of genuine value to use in other routes. But given the route's known glitches, at Â£15 I can't currently recommend it.","timestamp_created":1434159217,"timestamp_updated":1519598217,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.728655636310577393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48pTH5+ECcs6sPg=="}
