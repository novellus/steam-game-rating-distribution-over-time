A reviewer's gotta review: I review, therefore I am. \n\n   Did I honestly expect that I'd give this product a thumb-up? Of course I didn't. In fact, I would've been gob-smacked if I was in the present process of coughing up a POSITIVE review. (That said, I didn't expect it to be [i]this[/i] bad...)\n\n   Look at the title, for frig's sake: MAR WAR. First bad sign. Now look at the screenshots. Yep: another GameGuru game. Now look at the price...HOLY SHAMOLIE! They actually have the gall to ask FIVE BUCKAROONIES for this steaming load of bollocks, in the CURRENT YEAR no less! Well, colour me putrid and call me Gertrude. That's really quite silly, that is.\n\n   TL;DR: it's utter [i]balls[/i]. Possibly the worst GameGuru game I've ever played, and trust me, that's truly saying something. Medals for bravery need to be promptly issued to anyone with the mettle to get past the first five minutes of \"gameplay\".\n\nVerdict: 0.1/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1537036026,"timestamp_updated":1586947451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630128741264343262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h43cvvECcbvbqgE="}
