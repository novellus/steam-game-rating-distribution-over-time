Just look at the other games of this developer you'll know what I meant. \nIts a difficulty that demands precision with no failure to execute movements that no avarage gamer can do. So only PROS in hardcore plataformers can play this game without (much) worries. \nBUT To make it worse, it has annoying bugs like in the menu (often locks in it) and in the collision of the character against enemies, or when trying to hold/grip in some places.\n\nI really thought this game could be fun, as I was waiting it be released... but I am VERY DISAPPOINTED because I forgot how HARD is the difficulty of this developer's games. Although I may try to clear this to never play it again...","timestamp_created":1609694702,"timestamp_updated":1609804645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54666668176651001","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qLD15/YCdICRwAI="}
