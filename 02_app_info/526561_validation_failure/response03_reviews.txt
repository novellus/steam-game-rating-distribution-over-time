Regrettably, the price is higher by a similar margin, but there's always sales to compensate for such questionable value. \n\n   The quality's all here again, though. Highly recommended to horror buffs, if and when you can nab it at a fair price.\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1541604092,"timestamp_updated":1541604092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544745504856109619","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhvWw9+YCe7SjrgE="}
