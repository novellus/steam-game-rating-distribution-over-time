    review: 'Its not necessary but worth it for all the automatic features, additions
      and a bit more for your players. You could let them work for all the ''special
      ancestries'' that will make a freak show but if you''re nice you can buy this
      for starters :) But before you should go first for the bestiary after the core
      rulebook. Followed by lost omens world guide.


      For "just owning it" you should wait for sales. For DMs that runs (a lot of)
      campaigns this is worth the full price, too.


      For me totally worth it.


      Stay crunchy.'
