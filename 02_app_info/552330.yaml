    review: 'Quirky platform-puzzler with more variety than you might expect. As well
      as Bernard''s abilities changing across the course of the game, there are also
      some odd little mini-game levels which enable access to harder levels if you
      complete a challenge. (Such as walking a dog without it getting wet.)


      The final "boss" level was perhaps a bit too hard relative to the rest of the
      game (even before you unlock the harder version by clearing all levels!) Still,
      it was satisfying to beat, and you do get a proper ending which makes a nice
      change compared to a lot of more abstract puzzle games.


      Overall, I enjoyed my time with Bernard and hope the developer makes more games.'
