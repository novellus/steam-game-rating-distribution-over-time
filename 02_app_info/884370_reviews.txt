More polished than Beat Saber. base game better than Beat Saber. Better music and graphics. Way better than Dance Collider.\n\nThe gameplay is sort of a mix between BoxVR and Beat Saber little bit less depth because your slashing direction doesn't matter but it's more polished than both of those. Plus there are some other mechanics like slow time and the obstacle dodging is more intricate.\n\nObviously cant compare to the user generated content in Beat Saber, but that's not really a fair comparison. I like the base game here better. The music is way Way better.","timestamp_created":1541673144,"timestamp_updated":1541673710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwm766+eYCd8CqrgE="}
