At moments it really shines, and the price change makes it vastly more appealing. There are some really cool guns here too, and I love the environment design - i.e. Mayan Temples, Snowy castles. I think YRek is a game full of potential - it just falls a little short due to a couple of things - instant death-traps, an a checkpoint system that prohibits you from save-scumming your way past said instant death-traps. I recommend the first chapter to those of you looking for a slightly janky take on Turok - but beyond that the game has a few too many pitfalls to really make it worth investing your time into. The developer is fantastic, and is listening (and acting on) feedback from the players - so if you can think of ways to better the experience, make your voice heard.\n\nI initially didn't recommend this game, but it's getting there. My recommendation is purely based on Chapter 1 and the developers willingness to listen to feedback. With time, this could be a solid little gem - just needs some more polish.","timestamp_created":1598816635,"timestamp_updated":1604702102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540481388568878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn9zsz/UCdKbnngI="}
