    about_the_game: The video games you played as a kid, mashed together and remade
      into a tactical role-playing game.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Explore an
      open world where characters, items, and environments are an eclectic mashup
      of classic games.<br></li><li> Detailed turn-based combat system inspired by
      the 1994 classic, X-Com.<br></li><li> Realistic physics simulation and large,
      open environments allow for a rich variety of tactical options.<br></li><li>
      Permanent death ensures that combat is always tense. </li></ul><br>Every time
      you start a new game, the game procedurally generates a new world, using decades-old
      video games as its building blocks. The result is a collision of genres, where
      haunted swamps, tropical war zones, and peaceful mushroom villages all stand
      side-by-side. You'll build up your own custom squad of retro game characters,
      with a mix of skills ranging from mental health and reaction time, to the use
      of blasters and the ability to jump five times your own height.<br><br>Enemy
      is built on a turn-based combat system closely inspired by the original X-Com
      and Jagged Alliance. You'll devise strategies based around the unique set of
      abilities you've chosen for your team, and then execute them step-by-step, all
      while responding to counter-moves made by the enemy. It models the stress of
      battle on your heroes, who can flee or go berserk if things start to go too
      wrong. Additionally, everything in the game is destructible. If you damage the
      supports of a building in the middle of a fight, the whole structure can come
      crashing down on you. Inadvertently starting a small fire in the wrong place
      can lead to being caught in the middle of a massive inferno. Combat is dynamic,
      and easily spirals out of control.<br><br><i>Cover art by Joshua Hutchinson.</i>

    review: Play it on a difficulty that has perm-a-death enabled. It has a thoughtful
      feature set. I love the fire bomb lobbing pitchforks. Don't underestimate the
      power of chucking stones right through the walls to surprise your enemies!
