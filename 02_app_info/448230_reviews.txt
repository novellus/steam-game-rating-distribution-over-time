Math doesn't check out.  I'm a big believer in Early Access, because some titles need to start making revenue to actually complete a title.  Not everyone's got pockets of cash, or publishers.  But 4 years is quite some time to wait for a game to show so little progress.\n\nThere's not much to this.  You fly a ship, which handles quite poorly.  You shoot asteroids for points, which in turn are used to upgrade various parts of your ship.  This just continues until you've had enough.  Which wasn't long.","timestamp_created":1609204629,"timestamp_updated":1609204629,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44L+E1vYCeqmlvgI="}
