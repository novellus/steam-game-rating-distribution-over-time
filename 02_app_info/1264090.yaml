    review: "I got through both true endings, 1 good ending, and 2 bad endings in\
      \ 84 minutes. There are two love interests. Zero was a sweet feeling and the\
      \ second, Miel, had a good ending that made me feel a little uncomfortable.\
      \  It just didn't seem to be a relationship based on honesty although it was\
      \ mostly the MC's fault for being stubborn enough to just go after the guy a\
      \ bit randomly without all the info. MC is definitely impulsive.  the true ending\
      \ of Miel's route was better, but also seemed a bit off regarding how much MC\
      \ sacrificed only to abandon the cause at the last moment. \n\nThe voice acting\
      \ was good, though a few lines were a bit wonky but nothing immersion breaking.\
      \ I actually liked Miel's VA best, even if I didn't like his route as much as\
      \ Zero's. Good  appropriate music and acceptable art."
