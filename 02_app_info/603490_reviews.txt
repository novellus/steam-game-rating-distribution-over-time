Wave shooter.\nI saw it was not going to get any better just changing envirinments. \nThis would be better as an open world free roam game.\n\nmy specs: 16 Gigs RAM/GTX 1070/Intel i7-7700k/HTC VIVE \n\nThe game looks ok for what is there but I was expecting something totally different. You just basically stand there in this semi-beautiful jungle shooting animals constantly moving around and then wait for some to attack then run and then attack then run .... and then a \"boss type animal\" comes and you shoot it and it runs and then it comes back and you shoot it and it runs and then it runs away. Huh? And then some different types of animals cycle in and the same thing occurs. I was hoping this was an open world type hunting game which we need badly in VR like Island 359. Wiith this premise of hunting it could have been good. The game is just boring in the state it is in though. It looks good but that does not make it fun. Not fun and I don't recommend it right now.","timestamp_created":1490585739,"timestamp_updated":1509051111,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.279115557670593262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45ZKdrd8CfYiudQ=="}
