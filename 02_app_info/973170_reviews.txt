The Menu's look budget and tacky. Some people may enjoy it once you've taken hours to figure out what to do with random objects and the robotic noises become quite irritating (personally) and terrible repetitive soundtrack :(  Summary: Not recommended","timestamp_created":1609061979,"timestamp_updated":1609061979,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6rk0fYCcMjYvQI="}
