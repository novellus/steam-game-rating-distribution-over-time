    about_the_game: "You are John Blade, commander of HardCorps, an elite security\
      \ force dedicated to protecting the people of Freeport City. Four years have\
      \ passed since your first battle with Elexis Sinclaire, a beautiful, brilliant,\
      \ and ruthless scientist who is out to remake humanity according to her own\
      \ twisted vision. The law has failed to bring Elexis and her multi-billion dollar\
      \ empire, SiNTEK, to justice, so Blade is determined to take matters into his\
      \ own hands. Joining Blade on his mission are JC - a hacker with a secret to\
      \ keep - and Jessica Cannon, a fiery rookie who can find her way into any secure\
      \ facility.<br>\t\t\t\t\tEnter the living, breathing world of Freeport City,\
      \ a futuristic collision of New York, San Francisco and Tokyo. As Freeport continues\
      \ to suffer from mutant attacks, you must now bring down Sinclaire before she\
