I requested a refund immediately.","timestamp_created":1530747158,"timestamp_updated":1530747158,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444021344184875488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3//os+QCcJGbpQE="}
