Typing in words that might be important based on what you hear. The feedback for those guesses—when you type in a word that isn't relevant, nothing happens (really nothing)—is not the greatest and the hint system is slow and a sort of tedious. \n\n[b] Results System\t[/b]\nNot sure how I feel about the whole numbers system because it's also unclear to me what those numbers relate to. Like if you type in a word and the number 4 pops up, is that part 4 of a particular chapter or what? I really felt a bit lost with that and also with the numbers that pop up next to the topics you've found. One of the words, for example, had a 26 next to it. If there are 26 relevant parts, why can't I access them all? Why can I only access 10? I'm not sure if that's what the number means but... that would be my question if it is. If you CAN access all 26 then I'm not sure why it's not obvious HOW to do this. \n\n[b] Atmosphere/Visual\t[/b]\nI also found it a bit boring that you only stare at a talking picture the whole time, music also wasn't doing it for me anymore after the first 45 minutes. Without the ability to control speed of the playback or even scroll through the playback, it is easy to get frustrated when you miss something. You can't just rewind, you have to listen to the whole tidbit again and some of them are really long. \n\n[b] Concluding Thoughts\t[/b]\nOverall, it's eerie and interesting. I don't think it was a bad experience but I'd hesitate to recommend it because I wouldn't say that I enjoyed it so much. Still a really cool idea and a decent execution. I liked the voice acting as well.  A few times I was tempted to google the case but didn't want to ruin the suspense of the game. There is definitely something to be said about the historical use of the death penalty and the possibility that many innocents had their lives ruined by hearsay, prejudice and whatever else. As a black American woman, I can certainly think of a few unfortunate tales from my country's history. Would have been nice if there were more cases, I think. But, then again, with stories like this, more would always be better but maybe not the best ;)\n\nThat being said, if you liked Her Story, you're probably the type of person that is most likely to be entertained by this one. The novelty of a non-fiction story is actually valuable here.","timestamp_created":1564756216,"timestamp_updated":1565255979,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612947344779968262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/9mhuOwCfZHNzwE="}
