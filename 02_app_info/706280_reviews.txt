I recorded all 3 levels of difficulty cause why not, and there are some pretty interesting mechanics and scare tactics and the harder levels have added encounters it seems.\n\nIt's very interesting and worth a look at.\n\nAs far as replayability is concerned, I'm never going to touch it again since I've beaten all 3 modes, but I am still glad I checked it out to begin with. It's sort of more of a one off game, or if you do all 3 levels, a 3 off.\n\nOverall, it's decent.","timestamp_created":1602383254,"timestamp_updated":1602383254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn4LfivUCfISTpwI="}
