    review: It is just a nice, short, tale of being an awkward person. While there
      is nothing extraordinary about this game, for those with a few minutes to spare,
      it is a game that will bring a small smile to your face as you help the hapless
      protagonist through his awkward life. This is a game where even through all
      the mishaps and stumbles, you never really "lose." Rather, this is more of a
      snapshot of someone's life rather than a game, having no conditions of "win"
      nor "lose." Whatever you do, it will all work out in the end. I need not to
      elaborate too much more beyond this, as a visual novel like this is more appropriate
      for self-experience than for an unknown reviewer like to tell you anything.
      Play this, for you will enjoy it.
