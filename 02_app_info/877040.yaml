    review: "Incredibly frustrating. The gun-wielding enemies (which become quite\
      \ numerous in later levels) can turn around on a dime shoot instantly, which\
      \ becomes awful in tight corners, where you can't just snipe them with shurikens\
      \ from afar. Just baiting them can lead to instant death, and when they see\
      \ you, there's not even a microsecond of delay before they shoot you. Deflecting\
      \ the bullets with your sword can only get you so far, since, for some baffling\
      \ reason, every time you deflect a bullet, the game puts you on a 5-second cooldown\
      \ before you can do it again. This means that when you come up against enemies\
      \ with SMGs, where they shoot multiple bullets per second, it becomes impossible\
      \ to avoid dying. \n\nAlso, why bother making an achievement for each level\
      \ for completing it without dying, when dying just restarts the entire level\
      \ anyways? There's no challenge there; it just makes it so you have to exit\
      \ to the main menu, go back to the hub, and restart the mission from there,\
      \ just so you can reset your deaths. It's just more tedium for each time you\
      \ die to those instakilling gun enemies, all so you can get those stupid hats.\
      \ I've had enough of this game, and I'm glad I only paid around a dollar for\
      \ it, though even that seems like too much for this sh*tty game."
