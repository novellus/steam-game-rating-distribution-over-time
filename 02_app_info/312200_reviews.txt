Boss and enemy design becomes increasingly bad/lame/cheap towards the end. The game lacks the good/fun metroidvania level design because of its procedural world generation nature.\n\nWish steam had a middle-ground vote because this game isn't seriously Bad, while it's just a really hard meh. I can see why or how some would still enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1609959997,"timestamp_updated":1609959997,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45P/F7PYCesmKwQI="}
