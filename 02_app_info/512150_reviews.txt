I love this game!  It is just a perfect little fighting game, and well worth the humble asking price.  \n\nThere is something very satisfying about swinging your weapon, and feeling it's effect on your movement.  When you are able to land a blow, that is something special.  I think it feels pretty random at first, but slowly you gain a sense of timing, and for some of the later bosses, you really have to strategize a bit more.  I guess it would fall into the easy to play, difficult to master category.\n\nGraphics hearken back to the good old 8 bit days, where I spent a lot of my youth.","timestamp_created":1609903736,"timestamp_updated":1609903736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzLDv6vYCfdnywAI="}
