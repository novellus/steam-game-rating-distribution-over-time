      Knights organisation - a space guerilla force, going in conflict with Earch
      Navy for the greater good in 23th century Solar System. In the same time as
      UN Fleet seek for those heroes, they try to accomplish series of diversions
      and sabotages for the most important goal...<br><br>The game provides different
      options to complete, both by peace events and by empowering your battle fleet,
      fighting in one ambush after other. But remember: the stronger is your fleet,

      up of classic tactical games and skirmish board games. The cost of mistake is
      high in every battle, and losing single ship may turn up as significant impact
