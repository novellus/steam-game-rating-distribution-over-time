Sometimes it pays off, and sometimes not. Time Trouble falls into the latter category.\n\nAlthough the main character's movement doesn't look great in the trailer, it feels terrible, most notably in strafing and sprinting. \n\nDuring the FPS sections, it's difficult to tell that enemies are approaching you, and where you're being shot from.\n\nThe game doesn't tutorialize much, and you'll need to consult the menu often to take a look at your controls. In both the second and third missions, I found a vitally-important character command that should have been introduced when it became relevant during gameplay.\n\nI think that this game may just need more polish and \"time in the oven.\"","timestamp_created":1606619954,"timestamp_updated":1606619954,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtd+AifYCf+b2tAI="}
