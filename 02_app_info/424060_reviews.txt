I'm not 100% hating the game, and will change my downvote if this improves, but, judging by the forums I should have checked before buying, it's the same for everyone, and has been for some time. \n\nNot really a review if I just mention that one, huge, gaming, glaring flaw, so I will say what I liked.  It's a semirandom dark rpg where the map remains the same ,as far as I can tell, but the NPCs and items are different run to run.  Is that guy over there going to attack, join you, or sell you stuff?  You won;t know until you approach/get spotted.  This has the promise to eat several hours of your time, if it can be made to work the way it is supposed to.,","timestamp_created":1528571306,"timestamp_updated":1528571306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgeT88uMCfsjFogE="}
