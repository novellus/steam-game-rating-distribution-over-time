    review: "First off, Titans is the one thing about this game that has been bugged\
      \ to hell for me. The base game runs completely stable for me. Haven't had a\
      \ single crash in the ~68 hrs of main campaign and conquering the universe so\
      \ far. \n\nThen I made the mistake of starting the DLC. Crashes constantly,\
      \ the weird (and almost completely unexplained) battle system is bugged and\
      \ freaky - battles restarting instead of being won, battles being lost when\
      \ you have overwhelming advantage if you're not there personally (then why bother\
      \ with the focus on warfleets?), battles being aborted when you arrive, and\
      \ some more crashes. Did I mention the battles spawn out of nowhere with a VERY\
      \ short timer, so you better drop everything and get there as soon as you can?\
      \ But wait, they're story missions, which means you can't T-Drive into them,\
      \ you have to sublight from some distance away. Joy.\n\nBetter forget doing\
      \ ANYTHING else if you start this DLC, is what I'm saying.\n\nThe large fleet\
      \ battles also seem to feature enemies not firing consistently, leading to them\
      \ being slaughtered en masse - which might be a byproduct of the immense amount\
      \ of enemies the game throws at you. Constant spam of dreadnaughts, carriers,\
      \ DOZENS of battleships. I don't even notice anything smaller anymore. It's\
      \ boring, repetitive and bugged to boot. Just a slog to get through for the\
      \ next story checkpoint. \n\nThe Titans themselves are okay, if you like massive\
      \ overpowered warships that feel like godmode and handle like a brick through\
      \ molasses. The game was easy enough with the Deadly Perun (or any well-appointed\
      \ carrier, really), but Titans are invincible and since the enemy doesn't have\
      \ Titans of their own outside the buggy and boring DLC, there is no challenge\
      \ to their superiority. \n\nStory-wise, it's just as inane and lacking context\
      \ as the rest of Warlords, but Starpoint Gemini was always like that, from the\
      \ first game on: A richly appointed universe with lots of backstory that is\
      \ never actually explained anywhere. It SEEMS like there is more going on, but\
      \ unless you are the devs, you wouldn't ever know.\n\nSupposedly, there is an\
      \ option at the beginning of the DLC to basically say \"screw this, I'm outta\
      \ here\" and just get the TItans as buyable ships in the HQ. There is a choice,\
      \ but it is a story one - I suppose I will be reverting to an older save and\
      \ taking the other option (\"path of conquest\"), hoping it will spare me the\
      \ story.\n"
