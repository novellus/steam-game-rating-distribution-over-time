    review: refunded.  I love walking sims but this is a broken game don't buy.  No
      matter what setting I was on it was choppy, made me seasick to play.  Doors
      are locked and you need to find keys.  Well that would be great but the first
      key I picked up was not in my inventory when I went to the correct door. Also
      the inventory you have to scroll through everything to find your item...including
      pages you pick up..really just don't buy this at all not even on sale, because
      this is a broken game.  I didn't experience the darkness like the other reviewer
      did but I didn't even make it past the first key since it wasn't in my inventory
      after pick up, you do pick up a flashlight before that.
