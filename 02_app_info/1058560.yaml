    review: "I'm all out of whack with Vincent Lade's horror games.  I played the\
      \ middle one first, the last one second and the first one last.  My gaming pattern\
      \ with his stuff is practically modeled after a ps1 survival horror game puzzle.\
      \  It's convoluted, you might fake yourself out on the solution but you'll come\
      \ up with an answer somehow.  The bottom line is; The Swine was a decent short\
      \ horror piece and Harthorn was pretty awesome n' unified experience, at least\
      \ that's how I felt.  So, how did Deathbloom Chapter 1 stack-up?  It's pretty\
      \ solid and even more impressive for a first effort into the genre from Lade.\
      \  \n\nAfter a short prologue of past events in a dreary mansion, our hero arrives\
      \ at the looming Bachman Manor based on a letter he received in the mail.  It's\
      \ a familiar sort of set-up the dreaded letter device (Silent Hill 2, the somewhat\
      \ underrated Lethe, etc.); you've got history with someone at this strange place\
      \ and you've got the sense that things just aren't right and might need some\
      \ exploring.  You traverse your way through the gardens and sneak into the place\
      \ with all manner of hell breaking loose after that.  For whatever reason, after\
      \ playing so many games set in strange, massive Mansions (or similar monstrous\
      \ buildings), I'll always have a thing for that finding this item to get to\
      \ that room and slowly, deliberately going into the darker recesses of whatever\
      \ evil secret that these edifices hold.  It worked in the Resident Evils, I\
      \ enjoyed it in White Night, etc. etc. etc.\n\nOnce inside the manor, you more\
      \ or less end up in the midst of a cult mistaking psychosis for psychotherapy\
      \ brainwash and you have to search the place top to bottom, solve puzzles and\
      \ even fight to stay alive.  The exploration was satisfying with enough pick-ups\
      \ to survive scattered around if you take the time to look for them.  You'll\
      \ be fetch questing like Fido, arming yourself with different weapons from firearms\
      \ to bow n' arrow to hand-to-hand weapons, going up against the Manor's small\
      \ variety of dedicated s.o.b.s who want to give you a home underneath Bachman's\
      \ flower garden.\n\nFor the unity engine the environments look really good while\
      \ atmospheric sound really gets in your head with a good set of noise-cancellers.\
      \  It's sound that renders your opponents scary because their animations aren't\
      \ really up to snuff (especially their deaths), taking some immersion away when\
      \ you fell your foes to see them ragdoll bounce like rubber or have their heads\
      \ go full n' funny Jacob's Ladder at the very last moment.  Another downside\
      \ is a few of the areas seem to lag into existence and it got me frustratingly\
      \ and furiously killed unfairly twice by some mean-arse lil' masked entities.\
      \  It's not a constant problem the lag, so it wasn't too out of control though\
      \ be prepared to recover some ground ol' skewl survival horror style if this\
      \ happens because the game only saves at the beginning of new areas.  So keep\
      \ that in mind.  Quick-witted players should be able to set these foes up to\
      \ feed the death machine but you might need to adjust your settings just a bit\
      \ to get the lag down in tight spots.  \n\nThe shooting and control on mouse/keyboard\
      \ worked pretty well.  A touch more challenge would have been welcome but you\
      \ do need to make your shots count in the early going or there is a good chance\
      \ you could run out of ammo.  Later on all bets are off which made the more\
      \ sinister late game areas a little too easy to plow through, though I actually\
      \ appreciated the reward of better equipment the further you got to Bachman\
      \ Manor's ugly, rotten core.  I've heard some complaints about the bow n' arrow\
      \ but I ripped it up with that thing and was able to conserve a fair amount\
      \ of ammunition to bring out the big guns later on.  Despite tacking this on\
      \ at the end of the paragraph here I wanted to mention the map system; think\
      \ it's a surprising highlight that helps you figure out where you need to go\
      \ without feeding you all of the details on how to get there.  \n\nYour story\
      \ is told through your character's inner text-based monologue and notes that\
      \ solidly convey what's going on, especially for an indie title that is the\
      \ developer's very first work.  A few of the areas, especially when you're unarmed\
      \ in flooded basement maze are very harrowing and show a keen, advanced eye\
      \ for tension that a lot of devs can't shove out the gate on that first title.\
      \  \n\nDeathbloom's not perfect and I hope that I conveyed the things that might\
      \ turn off some players.  I feel old school survival horror players that have\
      \ been around the block and prefer a fight instead of hiding in a locker full\
      \ of gym shorts will have fun with this one.  This was definitely a good time\
      \ and I wanted to play it every night till I finished it, once I finally booted\
      \ it up.  I'll certainly be taking on Chapter 2 in the very near future.  A\
      \ solid first effort all around.\n\n"
