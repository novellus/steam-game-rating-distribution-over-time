Movement is clunky and stilted, items swing the way you're facing, not where you're aiming. And you can't turn to face an object if you're touching it. \nThe $3 I spent on this was too much, this seems like somebody's high school Game Maker project more so than a serious attempt at a commercial game.","timestamp_created":1601896250,"timestamp_updated":1601896250,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqZ+d/PQCcPqApgI="}
