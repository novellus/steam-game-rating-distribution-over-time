One day a group of college girls Jenny, Lucy, and Balbina hire you to investigate a dangerous clown that has been stalking them every so often and intends to do something bad to them. \n\nThe story is as crazy and stupid as I described it and honestly I find that it's charming for that reason and honestly I had a great time with the story. Considering this is a lewd type of game (not that incredibly lewd) I knew going into it that the game is going to be stupid, but I honestly loved the mystery aspect. The writing itself is often really funny because of the sexual undertones, but the story itself is rather dark at times often, maybe too much in certain moments. \n\nGraphics:\n\nThe art style is really good, I loved the backgrounds and character designs. They're colorful and bright, albeit overly simplistic. Maybe the environments are a bit too simplistic, but they're not bad by any means, but it feels like they are incredibly barren. \n\nAudio:\n\nThe music itself is the weakest part, most of it sounds way too generic and borders on royalty free tracks you can get for free. I feel like the tracks picked are decent enough, but overall nothing incredibly impressive. \n\nGameplay:\n\nFrisky Business is a visual novel, so apart from reading you won't be doing much. If you played one before you can expect the same type of gameplay. Read, make a choice, read, make a choice. It does have some slight detective work you need to do to actually get the best ending possible which is great, but often then not these are incredibly simplistic, like listening to your brain instead of your penis type of thing. \n\nYou can romance the college girls and sometimes their romance options will lock you out of certain story moments involving the mystery which was a very cool little feature and adds a ton of replay value to see every ending. \n\nVerdict:\n\nFrisky Business was a pleasant surprise. I expected a very shallow visual novel where the sex was the only selling point, but found the story weirdly interesting where I wanted to keep going and seeing how the mystery wraps up. Again this is not for everyone considering the lewdness of it, but if you don't mind, give this one a read.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10\n\nPros:\n+ Weirdly engaging story\n+ Actually asks you to do detective work\n+ Art style is decent\n\nCons:\n- Some writing is pretty bad\n- Forgettable music \n- Tonal shift of the story is pretty bizarre\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews","timestamp_created":1609533775,"timestamp_updated":1609533775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614415585994720459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yYvs3/YCepfBvwI="}
