    review: 'Despite having the usual drawbacks common to stories that are Part 2
      in a 3 Part series, CCH:KIP is a solid buy for those planning to play the entire
      series. Not recommended as a starting point however. Anyways, CCH:KIP starts
      your character off getting involved in fellow hero Crook''s plan to hunt down
      Manipulator. I found it annoying personally as I had chosen in Part 1 to stick
      within the law to bring Manipulator to justice. The story goes on from there.
      Your choices DO matter in this one more than some COYA games I''ve played. You
      will probabbly re-start several times when things don''t go the way you thought,
      unless that is not a big deal for you.


      I ended up with a surprisingly good ending I thought, all things considered.
      However, I plan on playing again as I had trouble with the end save and I want
      to make a certain major decision differently anyway. Having found the Part 3
      Work in Progress (WIP) I will stop here. I found Part 3 to be depressing. But
      that is my opinion.'
