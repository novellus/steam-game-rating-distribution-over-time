The story itself is OK-ish but at the end of the day, I can't recommend this.\nIt claims to have a lot of branches and \"EVERY CHOICE MATTERS\", yeah, these words are used a lot these days. But no, I totally disagree.\nIf you want absolutely no spoilers, you can stop reading here. That's all I wanted to say. \nBelow I'll try my best to be spoiler-free, if you think a little glimpse to the plot is OK, then keep reading, I'll explain more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever you do, whichever choice you make, the plot doesn't diverge from its rail. Maybe a few lines of dialogs change after your choice, then it goes back immediately forgetting what happened. If a certain character may die, he/she always dies. If someone will leave, he/she leaves anyways, even you tried to keep that person along for a while, there's no dialog for that poor dude, he/she will be invisible for the whole journey.\n\nThis game is trying to make a twist, but in a poor way. The first half of the game, as a player you'll be making choices for everyone, which is quite weird for a \"Choose your own path\" game. (which I thought it was when played for the first time) The game does explain why later but it's too late. I could not get involved because of this constantly hopping from one character to another, without explaining their background and motivations. I don't know what to choose, I don't know why it's me to choose. It was confusing until the later half, when I totally lost my interest.\n\nThe real branch happens near the end of the story, and I don't really want to call it a branch. It's just who you choose to [spoiler]romance[/spoiler] with. Other things remain mostly the same. And this is actually the part I dislike because it was not advertised as a [spoiler]romance[/spoiler] story in the first place. The trial, the seers, what are they? It doesn't matter in the end, and almost nothing about them is explained. They remain as a mystery from beginning to end.\n\nReplayability? As I said the difference is tiny between different paths. And there's nothing like a grand finale after getting all of them. So unless you're a completionist I don't recommend relaying the game again and again. Not to mention the game lacks some quality of life features regarding multiple playthroughs, like mark up and only skip the part you've read, or even a fast skip speed. (It took me ~20 mins to skip through, normal play may only take 2~3 hours)\n","timestamp_created":1608469631,"timestamp_updated":1608469631,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gdqQwPYCdfnZuwI="}
