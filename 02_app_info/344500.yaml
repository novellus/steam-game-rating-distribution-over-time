    review: I feel like I wasn't supposed to play this. It seems to personal for an
      outsider to truly connect with the story. The atmosphere and style are amazing!
      The storm builds suspense very well. But the options you have to choose are
      to conflicting and the answers too vague for you to understand much of what
      is happening. The dialogue captures how easily words can be misinterpreted,
      though. I'm not sure if I can recommend this or not ...
