    about_the_game: 'Step through time and discover a mesmerizing new action-RPG that
      looks like it was plucked straight out of the 16-bit era, but plays like a modern-day
      marvel! Inspired by non-linear Japanese retro adventures such as Wonder Boy
      In Monster World, Aggelos hurls players into the middle of a colossal struggle
      for survival as beings from another dimension threaten to invade the peaceful
      Kingdom of Lumen. Bursting with secrets and side-quests, and boasting slick
      melee combat that any 2D action game would envy, Aggelos is the perfect combination
      of retro style and modern-day game design.<h2 class="bb_tag">A vast kingdom
      to explore</h2>Venture through forests, seas, cave systems and ancient temples
      as you seek to uncover the magical elements needed to save the world from total
      annihilation.<h2 class="bb_tag">A classical non-linear adventure</h2>Explore
      a sprawling world that gradually reveals itself, Metroidvania-style, as you
      gain new abilities and equipment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Deadly encounters</h2>Thwart
      towering bosses and their tricky minions as you take on perilous mainline quests
      and optional odd-jobs for the people of Lumen.<h2 class="bb_tag">Tactical depth</h2>Unlock
      magical abilities and high-level attacks, expertly chaining these immense powers
      together to clear screens of enemies in seconds.<h2 class="bb_tag">Stunning
      sprite art</h2>Forget out-of-place modern art: Aggelos boasts superlative character
      designs and animations while remaining proudly, and faithfully, 16-bit through
      and through.<h2 class="bb_tag">Memorable chiptunes</h2>Lose yourself to a retro-inspired
      soundtrack that floods the Kingdom of Lumen with life.'

    short_description: Critically-acclaimed action-RPG that takes the template laid
      down by classics like Wonder Boy, nails the 16-Bit aesthetics for nostalgia
      fans, but updates the mechanics to feel fresh and modern. Explore a beautiful
      open world and plunder dungeons, caves and forests to help take down epic bosses!
