    review: "I could deal with simplistic games. But honestly there is very little\
      \ thought put into this. The characters have short stereotypical personalities.\
      \ The puzzles are all the exact same and even show you how to solve them, they\
      \ are too simple. \n\nI will admit I like the artwork and the backgrounds are\
      \ very nice.  Beyond that there is nothing here.  The game isn't even completed.\
      \ Until this game gets a major update and vast improvements and actually finished.\
      \ It's not even worth it."
