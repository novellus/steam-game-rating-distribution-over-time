      So I have to abandon the patch that comes out tomorrow ... (Update B13, December
      8, 2020).

      Oh and then no, I''ll continue anyway.

      Haha ...

      Nevertheless, thank you for your support and long live the disinformation! Also,
      Merry Christmas!'

    review: "Nope.\n1. Total RNG. The bad way. Like a slots machine. Your decisions\
      \ almost mean nothing. \n2. Bugged. E.g. you can produce a building that should\
      \ provide +X of something per turn, but it just doesn't.\n3. Bad interface +\
      \ bugs. \n4. Abandonware. Don't listen to the developer saying the contrary.\n\
      5. Too expensive."
