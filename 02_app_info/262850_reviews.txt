There was more time to develop the story, more cutscenes and a slightly longer game in general. I didn't like the final puzzle (I just don't like that type of puzzle), but I'm sure there are hardcore og adventure game fans out there who loved it. The final shot of the game was a bit underwhelming for all the buildup. I am def playing the final chapter, though. There are a couple plot threads I feel really invested in. I hope they pay off.","timestamp_created":1609850114,"timestamp_updated":1609850114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/emi6fYCdOjXwAI="}
