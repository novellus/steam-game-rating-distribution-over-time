      /><br>In the year of Our Elder King 1018, an adventurer from Samarkand drifts
      to Hardland. Now the Elder King is growing weak. Imps in his Root Court are
      offering bounties to track down Hard Ogres, elusive beasts that, according to
      legend, ripped the last king to pieces. Scattered across the realm, those pieces
      may still hold the power to change history. But others are vying for influence
      too. The Queen in Snow Peak wants the throne for herself, and forces from the
      shadows would like to see Hardland burn.<br><br>Hardland is a surreal fantasy
      adventure, and a mystery for players to solve by delving into the different
      sides of its world and the stories of its inhabitants. You'll search for clues
      far and wide, and you'll also search deep within. The kingdom is brimming with
      secrets. It's a kingdom that wants you to listen.<h2 class="bb_tag">HOW TO PLAY</h2><br><br>Play
      the game by finding clues for quests throughout the world. Clues exist in dialogue,
      books, notes, item descriptions, dreams. Everywhere. There are no quest markers
      or active quest logs. Seek out influential characters and dig into their stories.
      Use your sword with care, and don't ignore any people or locations. No matter
      how small something seems, it might hold the key to understanding a bigger mystery.
      Hardland is a world that reveals itself when you pay attention and piece together
      its lore.<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Unparalleled
      Depth</strong> - Explore bustling towns and hamlets across Hardland's open,
      multi-layered world. Discover remote regions, hidden crannies, and destinations
      you can only reach by stretching your imagination. Hardland offers tens of hours
      of playtime with more than a hundred unique NPCs, quests from different factions,
      and thirteen endings.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Dreams</strong>
      - You'll dream every time you sleep at a campfire, but there are deeper dreams
      to explore too. Find campfires in special locations and pay attention to clues
      for dream recipes throughout the kingdom.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Non-Linear
      Questing</strong> - There's a secret meeting tonight? Maybe you'll go rob graves
      instead. Or maybe you'll run off to ride a wild boar. Hardland won't force you
      to follow the story in any order; the game is highly non-linear, with complete
      freedom to explore at your own pace.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/321980/extras/Steam-Store-GraveRobbing-03.gif?t=1590001546"
      /></li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Adventure</strong> - Talk to people.
      Build trust and relationships. Wear disguises and see things from a new perspective.
      Pick locks to enter houses, and jump off cliffs with just a measly bird to help
      you fly. Trade with merchants for gold and items, or sneak up behind them to
      steal something for free. Take a shovel to dig for treasure, and wield a sword
      to carve out goblin hearts. Adventure awaits around the corner in Hardland!<br><br><img
