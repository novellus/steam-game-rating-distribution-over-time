Very limited map and all the same, and you can't even walk the cat under a parked car, which is something cats do when they're outside.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Have the up-high mice worth more than the ones on the ground. Otherwise there's no incentive to risk death and use fuel to get to them.\n2. Have an option to turn off possibility to die. That will make some cat lovers sad and they won't play. Give the option to change that to a time out or loss of mice or something.\n3. Give an option (or a cheat) to just skip the levels and go play as a cat and run around the map. From the start.\n\n4. Other music options. The driving metal is fun, but gets old quick. I'd even contribute some music free, and I make cool weird stuff. Devs can contact me on here.\n\nMaybe make the non-death option fun, like you have to go run around the open world for 5 minutes (maybe as a ghost cat?)\n\n#SandBox #LitterBox #GoodFun","timestamp_created":1546645619,"timestamp_updated":1546645619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4k+jQjegCebvCtwE="}
