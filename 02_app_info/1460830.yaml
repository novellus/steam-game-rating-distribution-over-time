    about_the_game: We finally found a way to make paintball cool again!<h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome
      to <strong>6 Seasons and a Game</strong>! </h2>This is a completely free, volunteer
      made, multiplayer, satirical parody of common thematic elements found in American
      broadcast television serieses (yes that's actually a word.) In this game you'll
      find fast paced classic arena shooter gameplay, bright colors, tons of Easter
      eggs. and lots of meta references. The early access version of this game will
      feature a classic style 8v8 map of unique characters being challenged to a paintball
      match by their evil doppledeaners.<br><br>The <u>purpose</u> of this project
      is for aspiring game developers to come together as a <strong>community</strong>
      to gain experience and <i>to meet different people</i>. We hope you enjoy joining
      us on this journey and support the continual addition of special and unique
      game modes. As long as there is interest in this projects continuation and volunteers
      to make it happen we will strive to improve this project to make it a unique
      and fun gaming experience for you to enjoy.<br><br>Remember! This is a team
      of volunteers with limited experience in game development and this is still
      a very early access version. That being said, if you run into something that
      you think is a bug, it's actually a feature we put in to make this game unique!
