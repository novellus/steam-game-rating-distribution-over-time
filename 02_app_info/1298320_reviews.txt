Great 2D pixel art, clever mechanics introduced at each \"world\". Many of the levels are superbly designed. Reminds me of AAA titles in the same genre, like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy. I am only OK at these kinds of games and could not complete all levels (although I always feel like I can see how to get through, my timing's just bad), but \"Skip Level\" helps mitigate frustration.\n\nGraphics and animations are just cute. (Try the up/down buttons some time.) Distinguishing collectibles in front of certain backgrounds is sometimes a bit tricky but it suits the game's theme and you get used to it quickly enough.","timestamp_created":1595640818,"timestamp_updated":1595640818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwldXmwfMCcJqwlwI="}
