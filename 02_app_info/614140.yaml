    review: 'This game, in my opinion, is a little overhated. It''s what I consider
      to be a good modern spiritual successor to Heart of Darkness (The PS1 game,
      not the book).


      Dying is great - The game isn''t rated E, so the deaths are a lot more bloodier
      and overall gory than Andy''s deaths in HoD. You have various death animations
      for whatever you died too. Every enemy/obsticle in this game will give you a
      different death animation if you come in contact with it. Sometimes I found
      myself dying on purpose just to see the death animations.


      Visuals - I thought the art style in this game was quite unique. A Disney/cartoon-ish/cute
      art-style mixed with blood, gore and sometimes horror elements. It''s not every
      day you see art direction like this. My only problem was that some animations
      for characters and creatures didn''t look too polished/finished overall. Still,
      they''re not too painful to look at.


      Story - Story is nothing that great. Plus, a lot of dialogue has typos, missing
      comas, and sometimes just bad humor. HOWEVER, some Hidden Scrolls explaining
      the lore and some characters are still quite good. When it comes to the story
      and the writing, it''s basically a mixed bag, but I don''t consider it unbearable.


      Controls - The controls are pretty tanky, but not necessarily bad.

      You liked Heart of Darkness, Oddworld, and Another World? Then you''ll be right
      at home with how the main character controls in this game.

      Don''t like cinematic platformers/tanky controls in 2D platformers? You''ll
      probably hate this game.

      I personally don''t consider the controls bad. I think they''re fine since the
      levels are designed with that certain control scheme in mind.


      Overall, it''d give this game a 7/10 and wouldn''t mind getting another game
      like this from the Under the Bridge devs.

      I recommend watching no commentary gameplay videos/trailers of this game first
      before deciding weather you''d like this game or no. (I say no commentary videos
      because every video/review of Illusoria with commentary are always negative.)



      P.S. Fuck the Meat Factory levels.'
