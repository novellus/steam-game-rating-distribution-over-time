    review: in all honesty i have to say the reason i decided to buy this game, is
      because i don't mind this concept type of game i use to play these side to side
      scrolling hack and slash games on mobile all the time, plus also given the fact
      it was super cheap, and yeah it is alright this game i thought at first it was
      going to be too easy and get boring but i found it to be quite challenging and
      i was keen to keep playing so i could keep beating my previous kill score, but
      one thing i would really like to see in this game that would really give it
      more replay value and longevity is add a system where you can earn coins to
      unlock items like new costume gear and weapons for your character like a ninja
      sword for example or even new playable character types, but anyway for what
      it is worth, it is a decent side to side hack and slash time waster
