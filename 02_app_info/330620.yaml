    about_the_game: A game of fantasy guild management! In <i>It's A Wipe!</i> you
      assume the role of a guild leader within a fantasy game world. You must recruit
      other players, lead them to victory against increasingly difficult odds, and
      make sure that your group remains happy enough to stick with you! <br><br>The
      game is done in a style reminiscent of old school role playing games. While
      the 'game' within It's A Wipe! is supposed to represent an on-line game world,
      this is really a single player game. The game play is a mix of strategy, in
      that you need to figure out an effective plan to beat the encounters, and management,
      in that you need to balance the various needs and desires of your team of players.
      <br><br>While the game does revolve around trying to win battles to progress,
      it's not your typical RPG combat. As the leader, you do not directly control
      your group. You set-up an initial plan, but your group members may decide to
      go off and do their own thing! You can shout a command at them each turn to
      try to keep them in line, and do your best to keep them happy with items and
      by paying attention to their needs.

    review: 'At first I took this game as a tongue-in-cheek poke at the classic MMORPGs.  After
      playing it for a few weeks - this is what I have to say about it.


      1) It has its own style and character.  Crappy Graphics.  Cheesy Music.  Wouldn''t
      change a thing!

      2) The raids actually feel like raids - you have to figure out their mechanics
      and set up your team accordingly.

      3) The raid members whine, stand in the fire, goof off, and go link dead ...  so
      real to form

      4) This game is a substantial nod to a very popular Level 0-60 MMORPG.  Not
      mentioning any names :)


      For the game''s price - I would classify it in the "High Value" category and
      I would highly recommend it to anyone that has ever done a raid in the older
      MMORPGs.


      UPDATE: Six years later and I''m still playing this game ...  wonderful game.'
