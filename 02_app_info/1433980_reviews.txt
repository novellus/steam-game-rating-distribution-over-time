Rather sub-par for Unity asset games.\n- if you have no taste in music? Also only one song, afaik.\n\nLevels so far, DO feel challenging (to me), especially on your first try, when you cannot see the all sides of the field after you start, or where you have to get to. But, that might be just 'me', being dumb=bad.\n\nPro Tip: Turn off the sound?! I was already willing to give this game a thumbs down, just because of the 1. music (you hear the same utterly annoying song opening again and again and 2. Coin drops (everytime you finish a level, you are 'rewarded' coins: 'pling pling pling'). What do you do with those coins? On PC: nothing.\n\nThis looks and feels like an App-Store ... app. There is no menu or settings UI. You quit via \"alt+F4\" (you turn off the sound via Windows volume control).\n\nAside from that, it's okay, for the brain-exercise.","timestamp_created":1608907106,"timestamp_updated":1608907106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472972989082336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7cSVzfYCeuWIvQI="}
