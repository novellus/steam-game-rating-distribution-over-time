Despite the listed play hours I played since launch off and on before it ever came to steam. Launch was a bit messy, but it really has settled in and has a decade of growth, QoL updates and content behind it with a strong player base even today. Building your ship loadout can be mathematically challenging (which I actually love) but read a few reddit posts and you will be well on your way (they have a whole section on ship builds including for starting and non-pay players). Some of the pay-ships are nice but are totally unnecessary to be a good player and fully enjoy the game. Lifetime sub is worth it if you like the game, but wait until it goes on sale (it is a decade-old game after all).","timestamp_created":1608743317,"timestamp_updated":1609728757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40PHT5fYCcvPDvAI="}
