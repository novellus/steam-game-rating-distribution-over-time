      notes: Atomic Society involves judging controversial real-life social and political
        issues, including abortion, sexuality, murder and several others. It also
        allows players to set laws and punishments in ways some players might find
        disturbing or offensive, though you are free to build society the way you
        believe.

    review: "This game is sad and depressing and it's exactly what you're looking\
      \ for. \n\nThe gameplay is fun. The characters roaming about a little corny,\
      \ but the aspects of building a new society are enough to keep you invested.\
      \ It certainly has worked for me so far. \n\nMore mods would be cool, I couldn't\
      \ imagine what this game would be like with the full force of the community\
      \ tweaking and modding it. \n\nGreat game, just buy it!"
