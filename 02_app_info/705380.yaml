      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Design the right ship to succeed</h2>Every level in this
      game has unique challenges and your task is to build the best or funniest ships
      to accomplish the missions. On some levels, you have to navigate through asteroid
      or gravity fields, while on others, you have to transfer passengers between
      stations.<h2 class="bb_tag"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Ship's Structure</h2></h2>In
      this game, the ships are not the usual boring rigid machineries. They have some
      flexibility, so you might want to design your ship to achieve structural integrity,
      because you can easily lose a part of the ship if you don't build them stable
      enough.<br>For further fun, the game has servos so you can build shape shifting
      ships, too.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/705380/extras/servos_(2).jpg?t=1538750505"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><h2 class="bb_tag">Energy System</h2></h2>In Galactic Shipwright,
      energy is everything. You do not need any fuel or ammunition, but you need to
      place batteries and power plants into your ships. Make sure that they are carefully
      placed because if you lose a module, you will lose its capability.<br>For example,
      shields are one of the hungriest energy modules in the game right now, but don't
      worry, you can turn them on and off, one by one. <br>This way, you can pump
      all your energy into the front shield if you don't need to worry about your
      back.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/705380/extras/energy.jpg?t=1538750505"

      the speed of passing time as you like.

    review: "Hmmm... ?This game has promise, but what i dont like about it is that\
      \ you can only made flat, sinlge block hieght, ships, which seems bizarre.\n\
      \nYou basically are making a ship silhouette and thats it :/ \n\nflying feels\
      \ heavy and slow reacting thrusters, you press the forward key, it takes about\
      \ a second or so to react, and then once key is depressed, the thruster continues\
      \ onb for the same period of time that there was no reaction that was incurred\
      \ when you pressed the thruster key.\n\nThe movement of the ship, alongside\
      \ the poorly responding keys- verymuch feels like any other game youve played\
      \ where you can drive or walk on ice- literally feels the same sorta slide affect.\n\
      \nI haven played further as i intend to return the game, but immediately, for\
      \ now, its a no from me, something of which i could tell straight away, even\
      \ though i love blcok building/ spaceship orienteated games. One block high\
      \ makes it feel like youre not really making anythin beyond a game intended\
      \ for small children."
