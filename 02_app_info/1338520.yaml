    developer_response: 'I''m interested to hear which level gates you found frustrating
      to enter. I tried making the harder levels the ones that are harder to enter.
      I tried making it to where getting from one level to another takes under half
      a minute to not make the hub feel to big and empty.


      I feel that trying to earn your access to a level by finding it is more interesting
      than having a level select. Also once you''ve found every level, they can be
      accessed through the book for easy access.


      The point of sand is to act as a hazard without restarting the level, to make
      it so newer players can still finish them while also being challenging for speed
      runners.


      I''m also curious to know which levels you found hard and frustrating. With
      all of the harder levels, I tried to make them lenient enough to make any of
      them not too precise. It''s also why I made the requirement for beating the
      game fairly low, to give choice to what levels you want to complete and the
      ability to skip levels that might be too hard or frustrating.'

    review: 'Hidden gem tbh, this game is pretty damn fun!


      Well I say fun, it''s only really fun when you get into a level. The hubworld
      feels WAY too big, and making to certain level gates can sometimes be stupidly
      annoying. I also don''t like the fact it''s basically impossible to manoeuvre
      on sand. Like, the game could''ve been a lot better with a simple level select
      menu imo. As I do say though the levels themselves are actually fun. It''s always
      super satisfying when you know you''ve come up with a good speedrun route and
      get a decent time!


      Cons:


      - The hubworld

      - The price point (should be a teensie bit cheaper imo)


      Overall, I''d say this is definitely worth giving a go. Really unique game.



      EDIT: Wrote everything before this way before I finished the game. Finished
      it now and all I can say is... It''s not a masterpiece, nor even great... just
      ok at best imo. Half the levels are either badly designed or just downright
      frustrating and you''ll want to skip them entirely like I did (no way I''m ever
      coming close to 100% in this game tbh). Overall 5.5/10. 6/10 to be generous.
      Up to you if you buy this after reading this.'
