    review: '[h1] Fighting Yourself. A Mirror Worth Looking Into. [/h1]


      [b] Who Will Like It [/b]: Those who are patient, enjoy stealth gameplay, and
      are a fan of dystopian/unified environments.


      [b] Who Won''t Like It [/b]: Those who prefer action-oriented gameplay, aren''t
      patient, or require more graphical diversity.


      ECHO is a superb science fiction stealth title from indie developer ULTRA ULTRA.
      Incredible visuals, voice work, and atmosphere across the board. Gamers with
      little patience should avoid. All others should treat themselves to this magnificent
      and underappreciated gem of an experience.'
