If you can't cross-platform to enable sufficient opponents, then you DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT!\n\nI'm sure it's partially the developer's fault, but I blame Steam for not enabling cross-platform gaming, or, barring that, refusing titles that will not have a sufficient player-base\n\ngarbage","timestamp_created":1551961315,"timestamp_updated":1551961315,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524895012378692627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ468qGrOkCe6q+vAE="}
