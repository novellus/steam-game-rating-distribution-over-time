    review: 2 words hit detection .... nah theres no combat here your saving the animals
      not bopping them on the head .... trying to stay ahead of the rising water you
      are a guy.. a steve Irwin type lol ( not really) but your trying to save the
      animals .. by tossing them to the next highest level on the tower and have them
      get caught or land where you want .. it took me a bit to figure out which way
      the person your throwing to was looking makes a difference ... but the hit detection
      regardless and the trajectory of the tossed animal seems to bounce off the target
      sometimes ... do i recommend it ... no I dont .. I may play it a little more
      but even at 3$ its a 1 player game a time spender I shouldnt be frustrated by
      the mechanics .. im ok with being aggravated by the difficulty .. but on something
      as easy as a one button hot potato game and thats what this is .. even on sale
      this is a waste of money .. maybe they made it this way because playing it with
      a bigger hit box would be to easy .. speed up the water .. speed up the guys
      or the game ... grade 3 / 10
