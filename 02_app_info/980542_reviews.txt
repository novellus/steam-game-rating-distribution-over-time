The textures on the red loco have been completely fixed. The cars were also fixed, as a problem with the brake system configuration was identified as the culprit for the sluggishness of the train.\n\nI contacted the Developers on their Facebook page - look for Digital Train Model - and they sorted all the aforementioned problems in real time, and swiftly made the appropriate patches to fix these issues. The patches are RWP files which can be installed using TS Utilities.\n\nAs I write this, Steam does not yet have the updated/corrected version of this add-on.\n\nAfter installing the patches, I find this pack to be a \"must have\" in your depot, especially if you have the Horse Shoe Curve add-on route.\nYes, I do recommend this add-on. Just make sure you get the patches from the Devs after.","timestamp_created":1606942406,"timestamp_updated":1606942406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1+bOkvYCeK7stgI="}
