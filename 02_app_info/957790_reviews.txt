I almost did that mistake myself.\nThe gameplay is FU%#ING AMAZING and this is the only game i play atm. Nothing else will quite do it like \"war dust\". \nIf you like \"battlefield\", this is it. Closest thing to BF in VR (so far).\n\nYou can choose to stand or even sit in a good chair, so you can play comfortably for hours.\nWhen i'm sitting, i do have some trouble reaching a new magazine, my nade and so on... \nI would prefer to have all my inventory higher up on my chest/torso (while i'm sitting in a chair), and not on my hip.\nI'm hitting my chair very often, and can't reach a new magazine (in very hectic and fun firefights).\n\nWe should be able to carry less stuff (drop gun, nade and knife) and then have the ability to run a (tad) faster. \n\nThe game REALLY needs A LOT more maps.\nIt has three GREAT maps atm :\nDesert Parables, KÃ¼ssnacht and Middle East. \n\nThe weapon unlocks are SOLID and MAD FUN. I'm really feeling the greatness of each unlock and always looking forward to my next upgrade.\n\nFix the parachute glitch ASAP or make it at least optional, as a server setting.\n(Paragliding mode : ON/OFF) \nThe same goes for the nade glitch. It can be thrown through walls, floors etc...\nEverytime i try to show this to my friends, they see that parachute glitch and goes \"meh, not my kind of a game\". \nIt's not exactly the selling point. \nMost people are looking for a \"Battlefield\" experience, only in VR. \nThe graphics alone, is enough to scare people away, so when i finally make them try it for themselves, they just see that parachute glitch and there's no way to convince them anymore.\n\nThe ATV should be \"first person\" view and to grab the steering handlebar, you should press and hold your \"grip\" buttons. For more speed, turn your right handlebar (right touch controller) just like in real life. This is VR, so try to make it as real as possible. With this design, you would be able to smooth turn (left & right) PERFECTLY <3 \nA bit similar handling, as the two guns in the chopper.\n\nWhat about headshots ? Right now it doesn't matter if you hit other players in the toe, or in the head. It's the amount of bullets that counts for a kill. HS should be added. More damage for headshots, at least. \n\nThank you SO MUCH for this AMAZING game. I'm finally playing VR everyday now =) \nI found my game.\nMAD LOVE <3<3<3","timestamp_created":1586356469,"timestamp_updated":1609986884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.704890727996826172","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmsis7fYCcP+W/wE="}
