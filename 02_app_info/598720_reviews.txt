The graphics and ambience are beautiful.  The in-game Radio's are really great, with up to date, real world news.  I was lying on my couch, listening to waves crashing in a storm, with world politics playing calmly in the background, when I realised almost an hour went by with my eyes closed and my headset still on.  The atmosphere is amazing already, and I gotta ask, to make it friendly to 'all' gamesters, that Survival Mode becomes an 'Option', and not mandatory, but personally I can't wait for Survival Mode.","timestamp_created":1520131589,"timestamp_updated":1520133169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49uu/9+ECcbbYmgE="}
