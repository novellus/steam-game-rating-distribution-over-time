You cannot play if you do not.\n\nAnd how about making accounts for all the 8 local players? You don't have to, but they sure would like you to do so.\n\nDo you like clunky interfaces? I do not.\n\nAnd in the end it also has the crappiest gameplay. I'm sorry I cannot refund it, but I sure can have it removed from my account.\n\nCheers!","timestamp_created":1515956668,"timestamp_updated":1515956668,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5uCD++ACdZSMlgE="}
