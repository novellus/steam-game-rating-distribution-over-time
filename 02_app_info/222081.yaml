    review: I've bought tons of DLC for this and so far this is the first I'm bummed
      about.  This was supposed to contain the lead & bass parts and while it does
      have a lead arrangement, it should actually be a rhythm arrangement instead.  I
      can't comment on the bass arrangement but the "lead" arrangement is missing
      95% of the lead parts of the song.
