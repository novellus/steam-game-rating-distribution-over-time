It's so obscure though that not many people know about it, and the only playthroughs I've seen of it online are people playing it for the first time, with little to no knowledge of the game. I always wanted someone to make some sort of guide of this game (someone that knows enough about the game to talk about almost everything, anyway), but got so fed up waiting for one that I decided to use the knowledge I got playing this game for hours as a kid to make one myself. Despite this, I figured not many people would care about it because this game never got any sort of sequel or remake, and any hopes of one were shattered when the company that made it went out of business.\n\nSuffice to say that the last thing I'd expect was a Steam port of this game to ever exist someday... And to my surprise, I found out that it did! Obviously, the first thing I did when I found out about it was to play it immediately and see if there were any changes from the original version...\n\nThere weren't any changes at all. Not really anyway.\n\nThere are some things I'd like to talk about the game here though. Keep in mind from here on out this will be a \"review\" of this port of the game in particular. Also, I'm not going to bother making a \"Pros and Cons\" list; I'm just going to put together all my thoughts here randomly. Sorry if that bothers anyone.\n\n- Saving in this game doesn't work for some reason. You can only save progress with the \"save-state\" option provided by the Steam version by pressing Escape. The only downside to this really is that you have no way of playing a cleared file of the game (after beating the final boss). All this does is let you re-fight the bosses though, so whatever.\n- You can also press Escape to change the controls of your controller/keyboard. The default is the same as the GBA version, except the A and B buttons are switched for some reason (probably for Xbox controller users). Also, there's an option to choose what you want the Select button to be, even though that button does nothing in this game.\n- As much as I love this game, even I have to admit its price is a bit too high. I ended up buying it when it was on sale for about $5, and assumed that was its actual price at first without questioning it.\n- The audio quality at times is a bit... weird. And not in a good way. It's most noticeable during the Jackbatlar fights and in Militar/bomb race missions.\n- The screen when playing has this weird, \"90s TV\" quality to it as well, which I also don't like very much because it kind of hurts my eyes. The border surrounding it is pretty cute though, and it reminds me of the ones you see when playing in the GB Tower in Pok√©mon Stadium.\n- There was another person who reviewed this port that mentioned that you can only have a max health of 5. I've confirmed it's 10 (which means 7 health upgrades), just like the original. I have no idea what made that person think it was 5, when a lot of people don't even know you can get any health upgrades at all. By the way, I confirmed it was 10 with the golden hotdogs; I have no idea if playing mini-games can increase your health as I've not played them yet. Considering how my playthrough of this port went I'm assuming that's unchanged as well.\n\nSo, those are the things about this port I wanted to talk about, assuming I didn't forget about anything. Now, would I recommend this port? I mean, considering this is pretty much the only viable way to get the game (legally) at this point, I suppose so. Considering the quality of this port and the game in general, I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale first. I'm still really happy that this game got a Steam port though, as this'll potentially give it more love from others; love I think it deserves.","timestamp_created":1604100863,"timestamp_updated":1604100863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wZb3vfUCe9mWqwI="}
