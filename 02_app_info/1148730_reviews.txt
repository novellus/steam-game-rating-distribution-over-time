It does so much. It brings vibrant, multidimensional personalities to life. It discusses the brutality of feudalism (unfortunately still relevant to today), while framing it from the perspective of a person brought up in it. There's a lot of worldbuilding lore here alongside character development, and I adore it. The queer/trans/nonbinary aspects of this game are delightfully made both an everyday part of the world, yet unique and worth noting all the same in ways that are say, interpersonally relevant while talking about the wider world (I really loved the possible dialogue between Roux and the PC in the forest on gender, connecting on shared experience). I absolutely adored the dialogue, and found the plot rather compelling, as it delves into questions of the transient nature of life, and what that means for the role of governance, and how we live with nature. I guess some things I wish for that might be a bit more work would be having two different flirt options if there is a bodily attraction component being invoked by one. As a demipanromantic person, it is very rare for me to experience attraction to a person for anything other than their personality, but something I will note for writing's sake as that, at least in my case, if that love is around long enough or strong enough, appreciation of the body grows too, but more as familiarity and the casing that holds the singularity of the person, and less as physical attraction. But, most of your flirt dialogue I used suited me just fine, and was very cute! (I also have to note that after seeing Livia's big muscles and her six-pack playing the Ambassador route, I was not at all surprised by her strength when she lifts the PC if you choose her as the romance option, but I get you were trying to say that the character is still surprised by her strength all the same. Maybe finding it comforting?) There were some grammar errors and technical bugs yes that I'm sure you're aware of, I look forward to seeing where this game goes!  This is easily one of my favorite videogames ever, wishing you all well during the pandemic","timestamp_created":1607585600,"timestamp_updated":1607585600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoLLkpfYCcYTOuAI="}
