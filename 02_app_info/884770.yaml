      was on an alien and hostile planet inhabited by monsters that strive to eat
      or destroy him. You are equipped with a jetpack, which will help you survive,
      but you need to be alert all the time, because the monsters appear from the
      most unexpected sides. At the same time you need to have time to collect as
      many stars falling from the sky - because this is the goal of your mission.<br><br><img

      you can determine which of your friends is the best space jumper. Perhaps it
      will be you?. The game is sure to enjoy the children, but adults will be interesting
      to play it. A nice bonus will be the opportunity to choose an original helmet
      from the collection available in the game. So you can choose the look of the
      character that you like the most.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/884770/extras/os.png?t=1530274878"
