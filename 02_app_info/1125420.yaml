      notes: This game includes death traps that will kill the player character in
        visceral ways. You can then see the character's body when you return to the
        area. There are also traps that require the player character to kill themselves
        in order to proceed.

    review: 'A short game worth the money.


      Overall a really nice 2D Game. Only thing I would criticise are the 1-2 parts
      in the game where you need to avoid enemies or deal with them in a certain way
      but the controls aren''t that tight. This can be a bit annoying at first but
      never the less a really nice game with a pretty story and some not too difficult
      riddles.'
