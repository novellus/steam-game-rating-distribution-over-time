    about_the_game: Once again 3DZUG invites you to dive into a bygone era - into
      the 30ies of the past millenium. This period was dominated by speed. Thus considerable
      efforts were made in the German Reich to speed up the journey time by rail.
      In 1931 the decision was taken to develop a high speed locomotive for average
      travelling speeds of 150 km/h.<br><br>Moreover, it was noted in the specifications
      that the engines could pull 250 tons (5 - 6 wagons) at 150 km/h and were designed
      reach a maximum speed of 175 km/h, if delays had to be made up for.<br><br>While
      none of the just three engines that ever were produced, is in working order
      today, 3DZUG takes you directly into the driver's cabin of one of the most elaborate
      engines ever created by us.<br><br>A myriad of details is waiting to be discoveredA
      lovingly animated fireman will actively support you in stoking the necessary
      fire on your spectacular drive. <br>Apart from the 05 001, we also provide the
      05 002 engine holding the world speed record in black. This engine attained
      a top speed of 200.4 km/h in 1936 and, therefore, made history as Germany's
      fastest steam engine. <br><br>The package is completed by two tasks of the Niddertal
      route (Niddertalbahn) which will take you straight back in time.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul
