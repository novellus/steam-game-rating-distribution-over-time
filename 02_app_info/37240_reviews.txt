I bought this game back in 2017, and I had an old one and thought it was just that. Skip ahead 3 years later, I happened to get a new Gaming Computer. So I thought, hey, maybe it'll work now that I have this computer. I downloaded it, and it just brought up pop ups about how my so called Display wasn't compatible. It booted up the game anyway, I went to start Story Mode and it just crashed. Can't even play the game. I thought it was a waste of money years ago, but now I clearly know even with this new computer that until they update this, which will probably never happen, this game was a waste of money. In the event they do fix this, maybe I might like it. I know I played Diner Dash games in the past on my Mom's Computer years ago back when I was a kid and enjoyed the hell out of them. They were fun. So I know I'd enjoy this game if it actually worked. Too bad it doesn't.","timestamp_created":1606762569,"timestamp_updated":1606762569,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40uOgjfYCetn/tQI="}
