Even if the game is not marked as Early Access or any information about its beta-state. \n\nIn current state i cannot recommand the game (20.12.2017), because of:\n- Key-binding not correct. In Tutorial you will get info for pressing tab to get into inventory. -> Nothing happens\n- In first campaign mode you get some quests, but no clue what to do exactly or whatsoever.\n- You get some info how to interact with your world, but the world won't interact with you. (except to kill you)\n\nConclusion: The game is not ready to be bought on the date of this review.","timestamp_created":1513789399,"timestamp_updated":1513789399,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.693823456764221191","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/aO4uuACeIvckgE="}
