    review: "Wow, wow, wow, WOW, people! This is an extremely rare occasion nowadays\
      \ when I can say: \"This game is my cup of tea!\" That was love at first sight,\
      \ I'm telling you. And finally I bought it and played till the end.\nWords can't\
      \ describe how charmed I am. No other game for quite some time could hook me\
      \ that much. I couldn't stop till I beat it and it took me 3 hours, man. I haven't\
      \ played anything that long in years!\nNow about the game. This is a work of\
      \ art!!! Posh pixel art everywhere and very fluid, beautiful animation! Divine\
      \ soundtrack with cool bass lines and some wind instruments, that help creating\
      \ that ancient pagan atmosphere and more! Sounds are classic and very cool too.\
      \ Very clever level design with as different areas with their own colour palletes\
      \ and distinctive look as possible. \nIt's really really interesting, comfortable\
      \ to play as controls are great, very responsive and you can feel your character's\
      \ weight and moves. There are enough secrets to keep you checking everything\
      \ around. And, what I like best in games - it's not very long. So you don't\
      \ get sleepy on the way. You can play through from start to finish without getting\
      \ tired, telling from my experience. And it's not short either. The bosses here\
      \ are something! Regular enemies are fun to fight too.\nThe art is 16 bit and\
      \ beyond. Not just Mega Drive or SNES - I don't think they could handle such\
      \ things, but I'm not sure. To me it's more like an example of the best of 2D\
      \ games on PlayStation. Many amazing details in the graphics... You have to\
      \ see and hear that yourselves if you value good pixel art and superb video\
      \ game music.\n\nGuys, developers, you are great! You made truly amazing, game,\
      \ very dear to me. Thank you very very much! I wish there were more people like\
      \ you, who can bring what made classic games so special into modern life. After\
      \ completing it, having had such a blast, by so much enjoying this gem, I feel\
      \ ashamed that I bought it on sale. I'll buy it for my friend too right now\
      \ - a promise!\nThe only thing is... I think CRT filter doesn't work. Turning\
      \ it on doesn't change anything and every time I quit and run game it says none\
      \ instead of crt. Maybe there's something on my side. Please, fix it if it's\
      \ not there, I'd love to see how it looks. I, and lots of other people, love\
      \ good looking scanlines. And make more games like this one!!! I know it's far\
      \ from being easy, but you're obviously good in this. Your game what you would\
      \ call it touched my strings. And I'm so grateful for that! For all your time\
      \ and work, your passion and patience!\nThe best of luck to you in your future,\
      \ guys!"
