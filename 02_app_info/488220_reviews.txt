I just want to get that out there to begin with.  \n\nThis game is wonderful.  The story line......fantastic.  A few awkward moments in the dark line, but it just adds to some of the humor.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game, the music, the story, the humor, etc.  I usually refuse to pay this much for an RPG maker game, but I thought I would take a chance on this one based on some of the other reviews.  I don't regret it one bit.\n\nNext up.....the light path!\n\n****EDIT****\n\nOK, I'm on the light path.  I was worried it would just be the same story on the flip side.  It's not.  There are different areas you go to, etc.  Again, recommend sooooo much.","timestamp_created":1488310381,"timestamp_updated":1489791692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561508655548095703","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzqWg79oCfe+wcw=="}
