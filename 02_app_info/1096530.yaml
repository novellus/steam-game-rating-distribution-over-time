    review: This is the sort of game where it's very likely to get stuck in a save
      position with an almost impossible battle in front of you. In battles it isn't
      clear to me who has been hit and even how the dice system really works, but
      to say the odds are stacked against you and it all comes down to being at the

      tried over a dozen times and it is really frustrating because I want to see
      more without practically starting over.
