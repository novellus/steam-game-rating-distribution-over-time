For any of you guys who have played Super Meatboy or Celeste you already know what to expect with VOiD. The gimmick for VOiD primarily being that you can't jump in it. The way the platforming works is that you reverse gravity. Meaning you go up or down. The game is surprisingly difficult, which in my mind is a really good thing. I expect frustration and struggling with these sorts of games. Couple that with some really good sounding music and you've got a decently fun platformer on your hands. Not sure how long it is, but I'd say the price is reasonable for the package. 7/10. \n\nHere's my gameplay: https://youtu.be/-vLScEd2b-U","timestamp_created":1562866305,"timestamp_updated":1562866305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/uiF8esCfNuRzgE="}
