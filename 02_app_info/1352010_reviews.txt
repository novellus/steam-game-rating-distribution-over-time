Cursed mummy is missing one important functionnality that was present on Boxyboy, its the capacity to rewind last few moves (50). So if you push a box by mistake, you cant rewind and you need to reset the level. Its not very important on begining but later in game, when the levels become harder its going to be boring to dont being able to rewind a mistake.","timestamp_created":1600792119,"timestamp_updated":1600792451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+8qq2/QCeOixowI="}
