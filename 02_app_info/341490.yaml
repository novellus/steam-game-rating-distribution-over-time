    about_the_game: Undead Legions 2 is a fast paced and chaotic top-down shooter
      combining Action-Rpg gameplay with Tower Defense elements. Hunt for power-ups,
      run in the right direction, jump for your life and never stop shooting to survive
      countless of unforgiving Undead arenas.<h2 class="bb_tag">4 Unique Hero Classes</h2><ul

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Support Spheres</h2>These are the central game element
      in Undead Legions 2, next to the heroes. They are your support base in the campaign
      arenas. They deliver power-ups, have healing capabilities, impair enemies, let
      you fortify and you can build turrets in them. There are different types of
      spheres, each with different upgradable modules, so you need to think twice
      about where to spend your money and which one serves you best.<h2 class="bb_tag">Powerful
      Items</h2>Items come in different rarities and their effects range from giving
      stat bonuses to granting additional devastating powers. There's backpacks that
      make you drop bombs when jumping, boots that let you jump as high as the sky,
      magnets that pull power-ups towards you and much more.<h2 class="bb_tag">Campaign
      Mode</h2>You will fight your way through multiple different environments and
      face challenging bosses before entering the next world.<h2 class="bb_tag">More
      Unlockable Game Modes</h2>While playing the campaign, you'll unlock several
      different game modes that can be played seperately once unlocked.
