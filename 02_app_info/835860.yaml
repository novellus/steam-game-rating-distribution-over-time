      \ /><br><br>Dreadnought is about one thing: team-based, capital ship combat.\
      \ It\u2019s a free-to-play shooter that puts you at the center of battles in\
      \ space and above the surfaces of colonies across the solar system.<br><br>But\
      \ it\u2019s not just you and your guns against the world. You have your teammates\u2014\
      outlaw captains like yourself\u2014and a range of ballistic weaponry, Goliath\
      \ nuclear torpedoes, and long-range Tesla cannons to fill out your earth-shaking\
      \ arsenal.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/835860/extras/UMG_ModuleDetail_ENGLISH.png?t=1593579541\"\
      \ /><br><br>Combat in Dreadnought takes place at a deliberate pace, giving you\
      \ just enough time to react to an ever-changing battlefield. During each match,\
      \ you\u2019ll be able to respawn as a different vessel and switch up your strategy\u2014\
      all while the opposing team does the same.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/835860/extras/UMG_EnergyWheel_ENGLISH.png?t=1593579541\"\
      \ /><br><br>Winning isn\u2019t just about cannons, missiles, and torpedoes.\
      \ Each vessel is equipped with an energy management system that gives your crew\
      \ the ability to activate shields, boost engine power, and amplify weapon damage.\
      \ Using this energy wisely is key to coming out on top.   <br><br><img src=\"\

    review: Cool concept, poorly implemented controls - maneuvering isn't fun, the
      weapon systems and  various range restrictions aren't fun. There's no balance
      at all, it's paper rock scissors and team coordination doesn't even exist among
      players despite being a team oriented concept. PvE is way too easy and PvP is
      nothing but cheese.
