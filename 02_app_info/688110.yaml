    review: "Blockgame is a neat little twist on the classic \"match three\" puzzle\
      \ formula seen in countless games. You'd think by 2017 we'd have seen it all\
      \ for this dead horse of a genre, but Blockgame takes that rotting horse corpse\
      \ and reanimates it with an innovative mechanic: you control a character that\
      \ must jump, dodge, and get the goat (literally) to match the endlessly falling\
      \ blocks. The fantastic characters and music are only the topping of this tasty\
      \ little snack of an indie game. \n\nMr.Mug/10"
