The monsters you'll fight around the world were once normal creatures, but they were poisoned by the swamps.\n\nThe world is big and diverse for this kind of game. It has a town in the center called Fortress, from which you can choose to go either west, east or north. There's desert, arctic area and forests in the mainland. Every area has towns or dungeons in which you can complete side quests. \n\nA lot of your quests will have 2 possible endings, for example \"you found a dream world within a magical flower, this world is inhabited by a queen who wants you to keep it secret, but in the outer world you'd need that flower for a task. Once out, would you pick up the flower and take it to the NPC who asked for it or will you respect it's inner world and forfeit your possible reward?\"... All of your decisions change the game in some way so there's replay value and I really loved this. \n\nIn tons of areas you'll collect little creatures called jar goblins hiding around - delivering a certain number to an NPC unlocks equippable (optional) items. This is a direct reference to collecting tiny medals in Dragon Quest. \n\nThere's a day/night cycle and many locations are affected by it. Some jar goblins only appear at night! \n\nSpiritual beings which grant you special abilities are called Artifacts (hence the game's name). They talk and adhere to the character that's in the first spot on your formation. You can change the order of your formation at any time outside battles so switch characters to give them different Artifacts when you find them.\n\nThe game is non linear so you can start and walk your way to the northern snowy area if you want, but you'd probably die to strong monsters in the way. Grinding is up to you. There's some steep difficulty curves depending on the order you visit the different areas. I faced the Swamp King at level 50 on my first playthrough and finished it in around 18 hours, but I revisited a lot of areas just to make sure I wasn't missing anything so that made up for more EXP - and didn't look for any guide either. You could finish the game earlier with lower level characters if you build a good team. \n\nDying will make you spend a lot of time recovering your losses as to revive your companions you're charged fees that depend on their power. This is punishing in the early game when you're still poor, but as you progress you won't be short of gold and you'll eventually find Artifacts that allow you to bring back your injured characters to battle. I recommend giving the major healing and reviving abilities to your magic/intelligence user(s) and the lesser/moderate healing and reviving to your balanced characters such as the hermit and the dreamer just in case your mage dies.\n\nThere's no achievements. Play this only if you have the patience and taste for late 80's RPG nostalgia - if you do you'll find it charming.","timestamp_created":1607559498,"timestamp_updated":1607669460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwqWkqPYCdcu/uAI="}
