Remember when Andy Dufresne had to develop photographic memory, master deduction, and figure out computer and electrical systems? No? Remember when he traversed the sewers and had to avoid a zombie while dicking around with valves and keys? Remember when he learned the Warden’s dirty secrets related to human experimentation and dangerous chemicals because he handled all of their documents?\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]It’s an adventure game with escape room elements.\n[*]Copying outside of the game and pasting into it works. It’s like they knew we would have to paste the same password 100 times.\n[*]I hope you’ve been eating your jellyfish, because you’re going to have to use your brain when playing this.\n[*]The visuals are interesting, to say the least. It looks like someone took photographs of all the locations and drew over them, but it works.\n[*]It still has horror elements, but not as much as the first game.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Much like the first game, there is only one musical track. Even though it’s repetitive, I was pretty numb to it through most of the game. I will say that it fits and has an “I must escape” vibe.\n[*]When you die (yes, it’s an adventure game where you can die), you’ll have to replay the level from the beginning.\n[*]6 levels.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]The voices in the game are text-to-speech.\n[*]Like the first game, the translations are strange (“A overlooker at such a time not to call”).\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Some of the clues in the game are randomized.\n[*]Better write down everything you see; clues are all over the place.\n[*]The door puzzle in the penultimate level is a bit finicky. Drag and drop the connectors slightly to the right of the number you need.\n[/list]\n\nIn my review for the first game in the series, I said it was bizarre in a number of ways, and that remains true. The translations are still wacky, the visuals are the same (with a modicum of animation thrown in), the soundtrack is limited, and the dialogue is all text-to-speech—yet I enjoy it. What does that say? It says it’s worth it. Get them both.\n","timestamp_created":1602634126,"timestamp_updated":1602634126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq4KckvUCdsHdpwI="}
