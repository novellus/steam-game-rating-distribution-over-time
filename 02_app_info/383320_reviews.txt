I don't often completely change all the keys for a game but I had to here!","timestamp_created":1518404990,"timestamp_updated":1518404990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626704812049865723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww67/w+ECfrDTmAE="}
