Cheap old low budget films like this should be £2.50 to own for ever on steam or £1.00 to rent. £3.49 just to rent for a few days is a bit of a rip off. Anyway, I'm a massive fan of Found Footage films and this movie has been on my list of films to watch for awhile. The quality options went up to 1080p so I chose that and it seemed ok, although on a found footage film the quality is generally going to be pretty poor anyway so I was not expecting much and I can't really say whether it was actually 1080p or not as it's all filmed on hand held cams. The stream was constant throughout with no pauses for buffering or anything. The film itself is interesting as it directed by and stars a a famous documentary maker called Werner Herzog, it starts off with mostly good acting and a great idea, but as the film progresses the acting and actors seem to get worse with some poor acting and editing gradually making the film seem like they got sick of it and just wanted to finish the whole thing as quick as possible. There is no real suspense or building of anticipation so ultimatly there are no shocks or horror. and it just plods along like they are trying to get enough filler to make a feature length movie. If you are not a fan  of Found Footage filsm then I suggest you give this movie a miss. IF like me you love Found Footage films then go ahead and watch it as you will see it refered to in various found footge movie reviews so it's good to know what other reviews on horror film review sites are going on about.","timestamp_created":1465074319,"timestamp_updated":1465074319,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549256384372711182","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46f/OjtUCe+ybWQ=="}
