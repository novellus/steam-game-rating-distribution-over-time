I'd recommend getting this on sale due to potential crash issues in some campaigns. \n\nA good feature of the game is the ability to play as any nation/faction or combination thereof and switch control between human and ai during the game. Actually this is a necessary feature if you want a historical game because the factions are ridiculously unbalanced, at least in the 1937 China campaign.\n\n My first game playing only as Communist China the Japanese barely made it past Beijing and by summer of 1939 they were completely kicked off the Asian mainland.  I decided to take control of the Soviets and Mongolians and turn it into a Comintern-capitalist war, and also decrease fog of war to see out 10 hexes. What I found is Communist China was surrounded  at a 10:1 numerical disadvantage by a combined Nationalist /warlord force with level 2 tech, the Shanxi faction alone was 2x as powerful as the Soviet Union and virtually every land hex in northeast China and the Korean peninsula contained a Nationalist or warlord unit.  I wanted to keep playing up until June July 1941 to see if Barbarossa was an event for the Soviets but got an unrecoverable crash in May, possibly due to the excessive forces on the map.\n\nAfter rage quitting and uninstalling, I reinstalled a few days ago and started a new campaign, this time playing all of the Chinese factions as the United Front until the Japanese are defeated. This way I can 'roleplay' the corruption and self interest of the warlords and Nationalists to keep them from building unhistorically huge powerful armies. So far I'm  in May  1939 ,77 turns in and I have a fairly historical looking situation with a hard slog ahead getting rid of the Japanese, after which I'll turn the other factions back to the ai and start the civil war as Communists.\n\nThere'e a huge amount gaming here for the price with the 550 turn China campaign, plus 3 300+ turn campaigns covering the Pacific, China 1941 and a hypothetical Australian invasion.  Also scenarios from 17 to 100 turns  including 3 Guadalcanals, Iwo Jima, Tarawa and Okinawa.  And a 300 turn tutorial I've neglected to do.","timestamp_created":1574897444,"timestamp_updated":1574903506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxYzk1+4CfIG73gE="}
