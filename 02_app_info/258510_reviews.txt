A great way to interact with other musicians whether you're trying to source resources for your own project or just get some advice on just about any aspect of music/audio production from the pro's (published musicians use this). The drop in drop out nature of Ohm allows others to come in and contribute to your music and beyond being immeasuably useful it's a lot of fun to just waste an afternoon laying down bits and peices in other peoples projects as well. It takes all your VST plugins from your other DAWS (32 bit only though unfortunately) and can export in 24 bit audio (Pro Only)...\n\nThe only down side is that the 10 project limit you get if you don't shell out $10 or so a month to subscribe to the cloud and the fact that this really needs to be 64 bit, not 32 bit...\n\nThis is a really great (and addictive) start and I can't wait to see what Version 2 comes up with when it comes out.","timestamp_created":1433630080,"timestamp_updated":1433630080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwN/A5c0CftL1PQ=="}
