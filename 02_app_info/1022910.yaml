    review: "A tentative thumbs up from me. The main downside is that Europa is not\
      \ included in ranked matches. You also won't see it in the infinite map challenge.\
      \ The full price of 15\u20AC is also steep.\n\nHowever, price and lack of ranked\
      \ matchmaking for Europa aside, it's a fun little addition to the game. The\
      \ color palette is very nice and makes for a pleasant experience playing on\
      \ it (opposed to the understandably dull gray Ceres for example). The gameplay\
      \ changes compared to Mars are subtle, but they add up and tweak the gameplay\
      \ enough for it to feel fresh.\n\nOverall I would only recommend this at full\
      \ price to hardcore fans of the game. As long as Europa holds no relevance in\
      \ ranked matches it's probably best picked up during a sale."
