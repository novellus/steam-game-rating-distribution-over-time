Also there are 4 missions - 1 land exploration & 3 Aquila naval missions. ALL OF THIS UNLOCKS AFTER SEQUENCE 6! The naval missions are worth getting this, some multiplayer characters are a bonus. But because of the short combined game time rather get this DLC on sale. This DLC is part of both the Season Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the game.\n\n[b][u]*Note: No longer possible to buy.
