The game is basically just round after round of gauntlet for you and your tank against other nanobots.\n\nGameplay: For me, the gameplay was not fun. The controls don't feel the best and within seconds you are over run with ten or fifteen other bots. I think the game would be more fun if there was more \"strategic\" fighting rather than RUN FOR YOUR LIFE AND SHOOT!!!!\n\nDifficulty: The game is more difficult than it should be. Yes, I am not good at the game but it is also very hard to survive past a few minutes in a level.\n\nWorth the Price of $4.99: No\n","timestamp_created":1549647933,"timestamp_updated":1549647933,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512569606304168701","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45N2N5+gCcMCtugE="}
