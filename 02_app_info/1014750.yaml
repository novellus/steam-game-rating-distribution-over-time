    review: 'Yes the game is short, but it is definitely worthwhile.  The setting
      is well developed and the story is well written.  There are some optimization
      puzzles and you WILL want to cross train as many as possible but these aspects
      are not too difficult and do not detract from the narrative.  This really is
      all about the characters and their relationships--all with subplots that complement
      the setting and main story and make it feel like an actual group of less-than-ideal
      individuals forced together instead of pieces to progress the narrative.  This
      focus on story and characters does not remove player agency, however, and your
      choices will effect your outcomes.  I want to play again and not out of a completionist
      desire or feeling I got a bad result but because I actually want to make alternate
      choices and see how they turn out.


      As an aside, the ending feels very original Deus Ex and I mean that in the best
      way.  I don''t like any of the choices but that feels natural given all that
      has proceeded it: you have to make the best out of a series of bad options and
      there is no obvious alternate that the game just doesn''t let you make.  There
      is no absolute best or "good" ending that I know of (it may exist but be hidden)
      but ones you can live with...and given the setting and genre that will do.'
