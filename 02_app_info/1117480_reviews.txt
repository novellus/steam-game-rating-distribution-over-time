Game is overall unfinished, with low quality textures (In high settings), unbalanced weapons (Weapons doing too little, or too much damage, Rams are an example) and rubbish enemy AI (Clipping through walls and attempting to fire through them).  Its not worth the $40 price tag. And was hoping for more.\n\n\nThis was quickly uninstalled.","timestamp_created":1599132563,"timestamp_updated":1599132563,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504104316234588623","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4487uqfQCesjBnwI="}
