I still don't think it was worth it though, because if all I'm going to be doing is petting sheep for 4 dollars (bought it on discount) I can surely do that in real life. There is many things that needs to be fixed, I only played the game for 15 minutes and it was enough time for me to know that this was not worth my purchase. This game is in early access, so I will not refund this game until they can do some simple bug fixes/patches. I'll be going through some things I found out.\n\n-If you walk far enough there will be an invisible ramp that you can just follow endlessly and until you fall. Towards the mountains.\n-I can walk straight through some of the rocks and trees.\n-There wasn't an invisible wall at one side of the map and I fell straight through.\n-One of the sheep facts was quite disturbing, saying that sheep intestines or something was needed to make a tennis racket.\n-I can't teleport when I enable the teleport option in settings. For some reason I can only teleport when there is no trees near me. If I go anywhere near a tree my teleport button will just float inside of my hand and go no where.\n-I went to settings, sitting was enabled and I clicked standing because I was standing at the moment, and when I clicked it the UI was glitched and for some reason it was somewhere where it wasn't actually, finding it difficult to fix.\n\nThis game is still in early access, and I hope they can get something out of my review and do some patches. I would also like it if the game were a bit more realistic, because this reminds me of a free online game that I would download and play normally on desktop. \n\nedit- considering how the developers of the game reached out to me and are fixing the game and patching bugs and working hard to make this game as best as it can be, i will be recommending this game. if you dont want to buy it right now then dont. the game is very very early access and is very buggy, but in the future will more and likely be fixed, if you want to buy the game then, then you will have to wait a while so the developers can patch up everything.","timestamp_created":1589379841,"timestamp_updated":1596577465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64965289831161499","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4qtjb3fMCfLu8hwI="}
