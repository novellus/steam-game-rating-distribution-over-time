    about_the_game: "Zball III is the return of physics puzzles series. This game\
      \ has puzzles about changing the direction of gravity.<br><br>There are 2 types\
      \ of objects that can change the direction of gravity. The 1st one is a button\
      \ - just press it to change the direction of gravity. The 2nd one is an activated\
      \ object that change gravity when it collides with a green ball.<br><br>The\
      \ rest of the game rules remain the same. Blocks can have different powers -\
      \ some can be destroyed when colliding with other objects or from an explosion,\
      \ some are monolithic but mobile, some can mve the green ball. Most often, there\
      \ is no specific algorithm of actions, you should rely only on your intuition\
      \ to solve the problem. Platforms interact with objects in different ways. For\
      \ example, there are platforms that make round objects roll in a certain direction.\
      \ There are transparent platforms that are divided into colors and can only\
      \ interact with objects of their own color.<br><br>There are game levels of\
      \ different difficulty and types. Some levels require dexterity and reaction,\
      \ some will require patience and caution, others will make you think about the\
      \ sequence of actions. You can see how to interact with an object by its color.\
      \ For example, green is the main color, and you need to deliver it to the platform\
      \ of the corresponding color. Yellow object reacts to explosions from mouse\
      \ clicks. Blue objects are destroyed when they collide with yellow ones. Blue\
      \ ones are not destructible, but they can be moved by yellow objects. Red objects\
