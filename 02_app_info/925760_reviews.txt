Mostly to help support the development of the game.\n\nIt is nice to be able to pick the other races and have more options to customize the looks of my character as I get my devotion up.\n\nThe good thing is that nothing actually helps your character in any way. So the game is not  pay to win.\n\nThe bad though is that often other players will not even see what you look like because you are completly covered in armor a good majority of the time. This probalby limits the amount of players that would be willing purchase this strictly cosmetic DLC. But they say there will be other DLC in the future. So hopefully those will have more purchasing appeal.\n\nI would recomend the DLC for those that already play the game and have their devotion up. Since they will be able to enjoy the game more fully. However new players really have no need to purchase early on. They can just play and enjoy the game. Then later purchase if they find themselves wanting more customizations once they have their devotion up.\n","timestamp_created":1545945046,"timestamp_updated":1545945046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6vg+OcCcL7RtgE="}
