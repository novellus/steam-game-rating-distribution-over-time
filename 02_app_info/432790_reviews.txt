Like a way to evade seeker projectiles without thrusting.\n- Story doesn't seem too good.\n- It has problem when scrolling the menus (it take too much time to scroll down or scroll up with the mouse wheel), although you can left click and drag to go up and down on the lists.\n- It makes my GPU's temperature go super high, and I have two NVIDIAs 1070GT.\n\nI give it a 6.5/10.\n\nThe gameplay is ok.","timestamp_created":1553043131,"timestamp_updated":1586205683,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4073OqPECeKu1vQE="}
