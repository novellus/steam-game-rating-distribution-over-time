At least this has cute art.\n\nWhile taking photos of the aurora borealis, you're kidnapped by an Icelandic elf. The game promised before release to talk about Iceland. Probably the writer knows nothing about Iceland, or elves, for that matter. Why my elf behaves like a Japanese waifu? Why would you write about an elf girl if you want to do a generic, trope-ridden story?\n\nThe elf tells you a sob story of how she was bullied for being different, and bam, the game is over. You won't have time to curse the insipid writing. You will be ejected to the main screen in no time. This isn't even a bad experience. This isn't even an experience. It's over as fast as a car crashing against a wall at 150 mph.\n\nPurin, I change my mind. I'm not amused. Even if it sells for next to nothing, that's because the game offers nothing. For 3-4 euros you can get some good deals, on key pages, dealers and even Steam, to grab a game way, way better than this fail.","timestamp_created":1470481083,"timestamp_updated":1561329306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.759494900703430176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmdGew+sCcpmwXg=="}
