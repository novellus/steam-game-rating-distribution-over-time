    review: "[h1]Okay so first of all, it works. It's just a bit buggy.[/h1]\n\nI\
      \ installed some new voices from Windows' settings and they did not appear as\
      \ voices on the program.\n\nI have no idea what \"Bound Hotkeys\" page is meant\
      \ to do. It just has a random text box... Maybe the \"Add Bound Phrase\" button\
      \ would add some bounds there but then the button is not working. \n\nThe GUI\
      \ is alright but doesn't feel satisfying. The drag bar buttons are a bit too\
      \ small. There are two drag bar buttons, the \"help\" button \"?\" and the close\
      \ window one. The help button doesn't do anything. It is useless, literally.\n\
      \nMoving down a bit from the drag bar to the panels/pages/windows, there are\
      \ no options to resize them. Wanted to make the Speech Input higher and less\
      \ wide? Nope!\n\nChanging the GUI colours works but it doesn't change the history's\
      \ selection colours. \n\nThe toggle view key is a mess. You can only bind single\
      \ keys, CTRL + [Letter] or similar won't work. If you make your toggle view\
      \ key a letter, after you open the GUI it will type the letter to the Speech\
      \ Input window.\n\nThere are a lot of empty space on the GUI that could be used.\
      \ No hard feelings, but I think the developer's strongest suit wasn't designing.\
      \ The GUI feels inconsistent and unprofessional. It wasn't very user friendly.\
      \ But after all, it works. Although the voice lagged for me too.\n\nThis is\
      \ still early access, so I am hoping there will be some major changes in the\
      \ future, which there probably will be. If the developer wants some ideas or\
      \ help with the GUI, let me know.\n\nUPDATE 29.11.2020: The program suddenly\
      \ stopped working. It's giving me a null reference exception. Reinstalling did\
      \ not work and I've white listed the program on my AV too."
