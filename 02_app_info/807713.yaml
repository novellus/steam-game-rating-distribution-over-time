    short_description: "To balance a pose you need to think of what\u2019s known as\
      \ the center of gravity. When you take the mass of the figure and drop a line\
      \ down to the ground, the support (commonly the feet) need to be on that point\
      \ or evenly spread around that point If the weight is evenly distributed among\
      \ the feet."
