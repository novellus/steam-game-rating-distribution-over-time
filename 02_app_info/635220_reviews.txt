There are no ghosts, zombies or people who will try to murder her but there are challenging puzzles and lots of creepy mannequins, the game doesn't have a save feature instead it auto-saves every time Mia advances to the next area. Throughout the game she will be guided by a mysterious English guy over an intercom whom she'll meet at the end. Mia is nude from beginning to end, when you point the camera down you'll see her naked body. She'll carry a flashlight that will frequently need batteries, if the flashlight isn't working press O to get a brief flash of light. If you love puzzle games or naked women you'll definitely love this.","timestamp_created":1554789927,"timestamp_updated":1598832079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ia70oPQCcM3yvgE="}
