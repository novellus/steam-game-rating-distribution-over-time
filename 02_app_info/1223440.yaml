      Apparently, he won a small defunct hockey team in a poker game<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nHe knows you don't have much going on, and offers to let you run the\
      \ team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you can win the Marcotte cup at the end of the\
      \ season, the team is yours!<br />\r\nOtherwise, you go to jail<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nSeizing the opportunity, you head downtown to register your team...<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn MHL, you will build a roster from hundreds\
      \ of randomly generated players, each with their own skills and weaknesses against\
      \ 5 other distinct owners.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the game is text based there\
      \ will be many opportunities to influence outcomes of the game, both during\
      \ and between matches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMHL is a small,\
      \ independent game made by a first year programmer. I really love making systems\
      \ and hope to expand this game over time from a fun little 20 minute diversion\
      \ to a deeper, more complex experience. I'm excited to incorporate feedback\
      \ into improving the game."
