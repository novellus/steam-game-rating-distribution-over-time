    review: 'Very good puzzle game that has balanced progression and very simple rules.I
      hate number puzzles and when I saw this one I almost skipped past it and now
      Im happy that I didn''t.This game is not really about numbers its connecting
      straights lines to get to the finish and I never played something like that.Considering
      I play tons of puzzlers this was like a breath of fresh air.The puzzles start
      easy and I managed to get through them without real problem until level 75 and
      that is where the game starts to throw harder puzzles at you.To be honest I
      was stuck on one for about 10 hrs :) .

      All in all a very good and challenging puzzler that is well worth a buy.'
