      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong> What makes King of Crowns Chess Online Different?</strong></h2><br>We\
      \ have a unique in game card collection system where you earn booster packs\
      \ to unlock in game cards as you win matches. You collect the cards to complete\
      \ decks that help to increase your score. Even if you do not win, you still\
      \ earn a basic booster pack that drop fewer cards. As you advance to a &quot;tournament&quot;\
      \ club, you can earn rare cards for higher points earned when you play other\
      \ tournament players. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/576690/extras/page4.png?t=1599248499\"\

      ve played and card points earned through games played. This total score ranks\
      \ players based upon their total achievements combined and not just their elo\
      \ average. Your Mastery Score is based upon the total of games you\u2019ve won.\
      \ Your Seniority Score is based upon the total amount of games played etc. The\

      \ system is also simple. You can search for players using our Match Lobby, by\
      \ joining a club or by looking in our global ranking list. <br><br>Setting your\
      \ game style makes it easy for players to invite you based upon your playing\
      \ pace. If you like casual play, you can set your style to casual, if you would\

    review: "Finger weg von diesem Spiel! Warum? Es startet nicht einmal (\xFCber\
      \ Steam). Und ich meine mit ruhigem Gewissen behaupten zu k\xF6nnen, dass es\
      \ nicht an mir, der Steam-Plattform oder meinem Rechner liegt.\n\nHabe die R\xFC\
      ckerstattung des Kaufpreises beantragt.\n\nMir ist au\xDFerdem schleierhaft,\
      \ warum mir eine Spielzeit von 12 Minuten angezeigt wird. Wahrscheinlich, weil\
      \ ich die Anwendungsdatei habe so lange laufen lassen, die aber wirklich gar\
      \ nichts bot - buchst\xE4blich nichts, nicht einmal einen wei\xDFen Bildschirm\
      \ oder Fehlermeldungen oder so! - und deren einzige Funktion am Ende darin bestand\
      \ von mir \xFCber den Task-Manager geschlossen zu werden.\n\nPS. Kleine Korrektur:\
      \ Wenn man das Spiel startet, dann erscheint kurz ein Ladebalken. Das war es\
      \ aber auch schon. Mehr passiert nicht."
