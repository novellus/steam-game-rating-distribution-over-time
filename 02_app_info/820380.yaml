    review: This game is a hidden gem,it's short but sweet as you walk through the
      maps you can really tell the developer spent a lot of time and effort,so much
      in fact that there is only 3,however I feel the last one has much to be desired
      as you can effortlessly walk for 5 seconds to instantly reach the end of that
      level,I was in shock as well when I suddenly finished the game it felt as if
      I just spent an eternity in heaven playing this hidden gem that's so cheap as
      well! IGN - 10/10 (sidenote due to my mother dying of very horrible diseases
      i will have to refund)
