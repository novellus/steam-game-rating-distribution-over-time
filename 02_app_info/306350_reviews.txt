It's playable with mouse or a joystick but even with keyboard there's plenty of finesse to be had with maneuvering. This game makes you hate collisions and love surviving corners even more. Characters and announcers are stereotypically campy which is to say it's just too damn funny. TIP: play on hard mode to unlock the last to circuits and don't bother buying weapons until you've upgraded the turbo.","timestamp_created":1606321036,"timestamp_updated":1606321036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrruMgPYCdd+4sAI="}
