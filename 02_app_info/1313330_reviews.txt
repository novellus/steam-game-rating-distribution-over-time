Platfinity is so much better than this. \nAnd cheaper too when on sale. \nI started to draw the tiles and I had to pick one tile at a time all the time.. Very counterproductive.. \nAnyway so no, I have opened a refund for this one as this simply just isnt good enough to keep. \nThings can be rough around the edges but to have a constant guitar play at you from the editor in this is just why? \nIt cannot be turned off in this software and if it can that off to sound button is well hidden somewhere.","timestamp_created":1605318177,"timestamp_updated":1605318177,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ju6a4vUCd7CdrgI="}
