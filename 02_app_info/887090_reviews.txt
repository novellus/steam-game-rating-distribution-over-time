It's a lovely *looking* game. But the engine fails to follow the rules as designed, and what use is a digital adaptation at that point? The reps from Avalon even whined on Steam that we, the players, were asking too much of them, while again and again issues were bought to their attention and not addressed. Sadly, this seems to be the usual course with boardgame adaptations. The companies want your $, but they don't want to provide a game that enforces the rules.","timestamp_created":1610048283,"timestamp_updated":1610048283,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l+SW7/YCfMytwQI="}
