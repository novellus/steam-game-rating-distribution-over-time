You start off with a slingshot, and powerups (extra life, enemy reveal, ammunition for other more powerful weapons, and so on) drop and gives you an added advantage. Most of the time you're shooting from an elevated platform, but you can also duck behind cover to avoid getting plastered. The further your target is, the more mindful you have to be of your aim, since physics does have its role here. \n\nWhile this game is good for kids, I particularly like how the game can be surprisingly challenging as you progress; a surprise to be sure, but a pleasant one. The only minor issue is the sensitivity isn't sensitive enough even at maximum. But otherwise, it's a cute game with surprising complexity to it. I'm interested to see how it'll be when the VR version is released!","timestamp_created":1552237871,"timestamp_updated":1574817119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4scea1e4CcpDjvAE="}
