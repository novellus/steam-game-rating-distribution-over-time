    review: 'This is a Hidden Object Game, developed by Orchid Games and published
      by Artifex Mundi.  As the game itself doesn''t do much to rise above the bare
      minimum expected of an HOG, I''ll be rather spare in my analysis.


      Positives:


      -Gameplay-  It didn''t give me or my computer a virus.  It occupied a few hours
      of my time in an otherwise harmless fashion.


      Meh:


      -Music, graphics, puzzles, voice acting-  Bog-standard, with very little to
      distinguish them from any other HOG on the market.


      Negatives:


      -Plot, writing, dialogue-  Started out.......okay......but then rapidly got
      quite stupid in the final two thirds of the game.  It had a moderately original
      plot (famous inventors from history, as well as Coco bloody Chanel and a young
      Albert Einstein {the less said about the latter inclusions the better} are being
      threatened by an evil madman who wishes to harness their inventions for ill
      means and profit, profit, profit) compared to many HOGs, but it becomes so  actively
      stupid and inane that any goodwill earned by its originality is squandered by
      the overwhelmingly intense feeling of self-loathing that you will experience
      when you realize you are wasting precious time that could be spent on far better
      games.


      I ultimately can''t recommend this game.  Your mileage may vary of course (it''s
      not completely horrible after-all) but it sure doesn''t rise above mediocre.
