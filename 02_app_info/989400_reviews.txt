It's rough around the edges, but it's Early Access. I like the camera roll, the pyrotechnics and the vehicle physics. Also, the \"Donuts!\" poster in the garage.\n\nObviously would make a great multiplayer experience but bots/AIs have to come first. I don't like to play PvP-only games. Anyway, great potential here, looking for ward to see where the devs take it.\n","timestamp_created":1574221082,"timestamp_updated":1574221082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522727310657501221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2e24w+4CeIqx2wE="}
