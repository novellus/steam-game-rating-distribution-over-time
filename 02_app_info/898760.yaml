    review: Okay so i am going to be brutally honest here this game is one of the
      best that i have ever played in my career as a gamer on the steam platform for
      pc gamers. Although i may not have that much hours on this game (i roughly have
      about 3 minutes on this particular game) this is still very much worth your
      money. When i bought the game well actually it wasnt me it was my friend that
      was on my account but it was discounted at the time but the point that i am
      trying to get to is that ever since that moment my life has never been the same.I
      have only had positive experiences since i have gotten it, some examples of
      this is that i was on a game of csgo when two random strangers gifted me karambits!!
      This has honestly been such a good experience  and i am recommending this game
      to everyone who wants to have a good time.
