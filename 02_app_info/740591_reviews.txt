I really enjoyed the suspense in this chapter for example (mini spoiler) there was a section where there was a threat and you needed to find a key card to move the elevator to escape, and when I was trying to find the key card my heart was racing because of how intense the situation was. I would recommend this chapter to anyone interested in a great horror experience!","timestamp_created":1596141581,"timestamp_updated":1596141581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rPbc0PMCdue/mAI="}
