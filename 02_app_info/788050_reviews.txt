I got this without realizing the point of some of the combat was to tear up clothes to see softcore loli hentai and cartoon pantyshots, making it extra cringey.\n\nIt's pretty awful. There's nothing novel about the gameplay, the writing is godawful, and as a \"visual novel\"-style game, there's a LOT of writing to slog through. Thankfully, you can skip through a lot of it - but if you do, the cliche wacky anime hijinks make even less sense.","timestamp_created":1600448034,"timestamp_updated":1609605236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.350745856761932373","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tj84fYCfPfMogI="}
