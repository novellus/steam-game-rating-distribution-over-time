Or you can cheat if you got enough money, you can always buy the nail directly from a ship.<br><br><\/li><li> Products expiration: Just like in real life, in this game every product expires. Some food items expire sooner than others. <br><br><\/li><li> Thirst: People need to drink water to survive. One of the challenges of the game is to keep their thirst quenched.

As these goods get used, they diminish, as a result, a person won't carry anything if there are no crates. Keep an eye on that ;)<br><br><\/li><li> Happiness: People's happiness is influenced by various factors. Food variety, religion satisfaction, access to leisure, house comfort and education level. Also if a person has utensils, crockery and cloth will influence their happiness.<br><br><\/li><li> Port reputation: You can perform traditional trade activities such as importing and exporting any product. This indicator identifies how often ships come to your port.<br><br><\/li><li> Pirate threat: Pirates are around. This indicator identifies the risks of suffering a pirate attack.
