    about_the_game: "Take a virtual tour of the Stadium Garden at Hadrian\u2019s Villa,\
      \ the World Heritage Site located in Tivoli, Italy (30 km from Rome). Hadrian\
      \ ruled as emperor from 117 to 138 of our era. This was the period when the\
      \ Roman empire was at its peak in terms of culture, economic development, and\
      \ military security. An enthusiastic builder and patron of the arts, Hadrian\
      \ developed the villa throughout his reign. Known today as Hadrian\u2019s Villa,\
      \ the place was a government retreat where the emperor and his court could pursue\
      \ the everyday tasks of administering the vast empire while also enjoying leisure\
      \ activities such as bathing, banqueting, hunting, taking recreational walks\
      \ (ambulationes), attending the theater, and even watching gladiators fight\
      \ in a private arena. Lavishly decorated with sculpture, gardens, and fountains\
      \ of all kinds, the villa was a delight to the eye of the ancient visitor. Today,\
      \ the villa is in ruins. Some of its many major buildings are well preserved,\
      \ while others have been reduced to their foundations\u2014often invisible below\
      \ the modern surface.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis virtual tour presents the Stadium\
      \ Garden. \u201CStadium Garden\u201D is the modern name for a major complex\
      \ at Hadrian\u2019s Villa that, despite what we conventionally call it, was\
      \ neither a stadium nor a garden. Instead, it consisted of structures used in\
      \ warm weather to host imperial audiences, receptions, dinner parties, and ambulationes.\
      \ The virtual tour takes you back in time to the 130s CE so that you can visit\
      \ the site reconstructed as it appeared late in the reign of Hadrian. Along\
      \ the way, you can also go up into the air to see the villa in the context of\
      \ the enchanting landscape of the Tivoli area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour guide\
      \ is Prof. Bernard Frischer, Director of the Digital Hadrian\u2019s Villa Project.\
      \ As you follow your curiosity and explore the highly accurate 3D reconstruction,\
      \ you can play audio tracks in which Prof. Frischer explains what you are seeing\
      \ and how the place was used in Hadrian\u2019s day. Learn about imperial audiences,\
      \ the imperial court, the Praetorian Guard, what went on at the emperor\u2019\
      s private banquets, and the Roman elite habit of the ambulatio. Understand how\
      \ the Romans cleverly designed the rooms to be airy and cool during the heat\
      \ of summer. Visit the emperor\u2019s very own private dining room, and see\
      \ the impressive North Hall, South Hall, the lovely North Garden with its surrounding\
      \ peristyle. The dining room was used at night, so we even let you see how enchanting\

      \ and torches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf art interests you, this is the right tour\
      \ for you. On it, you will learn about herms, oscilla, wall painting in the\

      \ of statues, ranging from the 16 statues illustrating the tragic story of Niobe\
      \ in the South Nymphaeum to the only known sculpture gallery at the villa, which\
      \ was housed in the North Hall. Here you can see such famous statues from Hadrian\u2019\
      s Villa as Endymion (now in Stockholm), Cupid and Psyche (now in San Antonio,\
      \ Texas), the Pasquino Group (fragments of which are in the Vatican Museums),\

      <br />\r\nAnyone who takes Flyover Zone\u2019s virtual tour of the Stadium Garden\
      \ comes away knowing far more about it than even a visitor to the actual archaeological\

      \ to see the villa, you will get more out of your visit after taking Flyover\
      \ Zone\u2019s virtual tour. And, since the virtual tour runs not only on PCs\
