    review: "So I got Goblins Part 1 because of the deluxe edition.\nYou had to start\
      \ with new characters, because now everybody is a Goblin.\nCompled part 1, it\
      \ was ok\xE9-ish, not bad, not good.\nI saw the deluxe edition not has this\
      \ part, part 2.\n\nSo I was half-forced to buy part 2, who plays only half an\
      \ advneture, right?\nPart 2 was less fun than part 1. Just more of the same,\
      \ go grab some firework for the boss, done...\nThey didn't even took the time\
      \ to make an achievment for completed this DLC.\nWhich is weird, because completing\
      \ Goblins part 1 did give an achievment.\n\nI feel this extra level is just\
      \ a money grab, even making these DLC's while the maingame is FULL of buggs\
      \ is bad.\n\nAlso, the bossfight in this DLC has a massive bug, I had to restart\
      \ the game (ALT-F4) three times untill I found a card I could click that didn't\
      \ freeze the game.\n\nSo, enjou the long main adventure, and be happy with it,\
      \ this DLC is downhill from that."
