The main problem then became a focus on such unarbitrary aspects concluding most that the training level was 'weird' (it is like a flight simulating duel game on the ZX Spectrum). \n\nThe fluid-reality gameplay which realises you cannot slow down to a stop whilst playing the levels, understood you do not have to kill everything and then sometimes you do. A times I thought this game was amusing in the same vein as Assault was on the PS1; I played it for the same undulating reasons, not really because it is an episode in the Nightstar series.
