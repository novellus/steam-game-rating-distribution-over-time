However, the graphics and the monsters are gorgeous. The developer did a great job and paid attention to all details. The game plays very well and draws you in; you do feel you are really the last man standing defending the tree of life. I like the teleport touch and the fireball weapon (feels a bit like basketball :) \n\nThe game makes you look around and strategize agains carefully orchestrated monsters in each wave. I like the monster variety, and the big boss is super cool :)\n\nIt's a bargain for the price it's being sold.","timestamp_created":1506443546,"timestamp_updated":1506443546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449966490268707275","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2YnC394Cc+2vhgE="}
