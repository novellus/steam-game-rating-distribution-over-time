    review: Quest for Glory is a must for people who like adventure games. Ofc they
      are now dated (graphic and interface) but still give a lot of enjoyment for
      people who can accept this fact. Yeah, if you checking this game you probably
      played those games as a child and want to feel those memories of childchood
      again. You may be also the one who just like to see how games progressed in
      years. When you laid back and relax and play those games just for fun they will
      give you a lot of it. Recommended.
