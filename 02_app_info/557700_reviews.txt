The setting, the characters, I wanted it to be great, and it was at first. Then came the choices. The stats are too overly complicated to relate to the choices given to you and it's hard to figure out exactly what each choice will come out to be. Not that I'm against being surprised, but when you're trying to decide if a game changing choice is going to use your \"reflex\" or \"finesse\" skill then it becomes too stressful for this genre of game.\n\nThe writing, oh god, the writing. It was superb, easy to follow the narrative, and it was really immersive. Until about half way through the game. The author wanted to make the plot more complex and add new characters and mechanics, but ultimately it ended up being a quagmire of different words that felt important, but was hard to relate to other parts of the story. This includes the characters too. Each character felt unique and special in their own way, but when you got into the nitty gritty of the story in the later chapters, they lost their luster and unless you were focusing on one or two specific characters, you simply could not keep track of them and many were left in the background as you went through your branch of the story.\n\nLong story short, pick this up if it's on sale, otherwise, go play Choice of Robots. Choice of the Deathless is even easier to follow than this one, and Deathless is just one huge time jumping flashback.","timestamp_created":1579035737,"timestamp_updated":1579035737,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540798306465148926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uqf30u8Cfcv86wE="}
