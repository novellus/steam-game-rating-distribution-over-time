    about_the_game: "Mikoto is a foxgirl who lives deep in the woods, in a settlement\
      \ full of foxgirls called Yamatai. Mikoto\u2019s mother, Himiko, is the leader\
      \ of these foxgirls, and she commends immense magical powers.<br>As the daughter\
      \ of an illustrious woman, Mikoto is expected to train hard, and one day take\
      \ her mother\u2019s place \u2013 but there\u2019s a catch. Mikoto is a complete\
      \ failure of a foxgirl!<br><br>Despite being twenty-five years of age, Mikoto\
      \ only has one tail. She fumbles even the simplest of spells, and her hand-to-hand\
      \ combat skills are laughable. She routinely loses mock battles against her\
      \ tutor, Ohana, and the other foxgirls in her clan shun and mock her owing to\
      \ her ineptitude.<br>Unsatisfied with her mundane life in Yamatai, Mikoto dreams\
      \ of leaving home and speaking to the humans that live in the nearby Warren\
      \ Village. Mikoto has heard humans are wicked and untrustworthy, but Mikoto\
      \ is an optimist at heart, and she\u2019s sure humans can\u2019t be as bad as\
      \ the stories say.<br>And so, on one dark night, Mikoto runs away from her home\
      \ to attend the annual harvest festival in Warren Village. There, she meets\
      \ a beautiful knight called Juni, and she is irrevocably drawn to her. An intense,\
      \ passionate relationship soon blossoms between the pair\u2026<br><br>But foxgirls\
      \ like Mikoto aren\u2019t welcome among humans, and Ohana is determined to get\
      \ her runaway pupil back, no matter the cost.<br>Can Mikoto and Juni\u2019s\
      \ love work out, or is it doomed to failure? That depends on you!<br><br><img\
