    short_description: Nestled at the foot of the Southern Alps, this paradise is
      home to both temperate beech forests and steep alpine peaks. While some are
      drawn here in search of Sika Deer, others come to trace its trails of history.
      You can rest easy knowing your next adventure awaits in Te Awaroa National Park.

    review: "First dlc map where I have to admit that it does not reach the qualities\
      \ of the previous ones. \nThe roads here have exactly the same texture as roads\
      \ on Hirschfeldeon or Silver Ridge. Very disappointing. \nThe whole environment\
      \ seems more generic, I miss the beautiful rounded and larger mountains, every\
      \ places here are just boring and uninteresting. They simply did not capture\
      \ the potential of the real beautiful nature of New Zealand. \nIt feels more\
      \ like an unknown fictional tropical island. :(\nPS: Very short story, lack\
      \ of new or exotic animal species and everything is in cold blue filter which\
      \ is a bit boring too."
