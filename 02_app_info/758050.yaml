    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome to Internet Simulator's store page!</h2><br>In
      the game you can browse the Internet from beautiful locations, interact with
      the computer and the environment. <br>The game will evolve a lot, and I was
      thinking about launching it in Early Access, but it's better for me to go with
      full release model, just keep in mind that game willl evolve extremely.<br><br>Description
      of the game at the moment:<br><br>-Ability to browse the internet via a virtual
      computer<br>-OS on the computer with mail and gallery, PC can be turned off
      via a button within the OS interface<br>-Comments when you visit certain web-sites<br>-3
      Levels to choose from (much more to come)<br>-Interactivity and a feature of
      the level &quot;Room&quot; - you can turn on and off the lights, turn off the
      computer through the PC case, and you can also kill the character forcing him
      to jump out the window.<br>-Interactive objects that can be moved<br>-Ability
      to walk, run, sit on a chair <br>-Steam Achievements<br>-Ability to pray to
      Putin and get money for that (Tab to pray, E to stop praying)<br>-Ability to
      buy furniture for that money in online store<br>-3 different characters<br>-2
      camera modes<br><br>Current levels:<br>-Room<br>-Toilet<br>-Beach<br><br>The
      main goals of this project are to give a person an ability to browse the internet
      from really beautiful places. To relax, escape from reailty being surrounded
      by mountains.<br>It's a place where you can morally rest, forget about everything.
      Just be surrounded by beauty, believe what you find there and for example watch
      movies or listen to relaxing music. You can even use forums and imageboads inside
      this game.<br>In a few months after release next to the player there will be
      optional to sit a friend (female or male AI) that will comment on the sites
      on which the player enters. With a friend you can also talk on different topics,
      and I'll try to make as many dialogs as possible so that the player won't be
      sad from the fact that his friend is just an AI.
