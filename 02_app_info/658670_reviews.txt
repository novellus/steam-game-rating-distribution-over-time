So not worth it. $1 for 3 poorly designed levels with what can be described as weak at best competitive multiplayer. There is no actual competition. Levels drag on with too much time per round. No real game play or strategy. The only reason I don't request a refund is that in hopes that my $1 could possibly fund some improvement.","timestamp_created":1509853533,"timestamp_updated":1509853792,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539007067680358887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8JCTxd8Ce7y2igE="}
