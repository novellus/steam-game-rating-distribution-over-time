It's missing one tiny feature (list of struct-like properties) to be the best thing ever created, but it might get there too, maybe. Hopefully. We'll see.\n\n10/10 would recommend.","timestamp_created":1609021866,"timestamp_updated":1609583884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7p6r4fYCcqLFvQI="}
