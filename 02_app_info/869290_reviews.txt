Most VR games have the player looking either straight ahead or down, but this game mostly had one looking up but also makes the player look all around and this combined with the vary varied arm motions that the gameplay encourages, makes this an excellent game to help loosen up one's neck and shoulder muscles.\n\nApart from these benefits, the gameplay has a nice progression with some fun speed challenges thrown in here and there (optional) and a friendly and easy to read visual presentation. In terms of graphics it's about on-par with mobile VR, so don't expect amazing graphical fidelity, but it really doesn't matter when you're playing.\n\nAs a slight negative, if you are using the Valve Index controllers, you'll need to either set op your own mappings or use a user submitted one (there's a quite good one already available) as the default mapping plain doesn't work.","timestamp_created":1606048216,"timestamp_updated":1606048216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvN779/UCdf3urwI="}
