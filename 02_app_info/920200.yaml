      \ disappearing. It remained unowned for close to 100 years until Reuben's uncle,\
      \ who dismissed the disappearances as silly rumours, decided to purchase the\
      \ mansion and renovate it. He died many years later from natural causes, so\
      \ it appeared that the disappearances were indeed just a rumour. As the new\
      \ owner, Reuben decides to explore the mansion that he hasn't seen in years.\
      \ He soon discovers a secret room that he never noticed when he was younger,\
      \ and neither did his uncle. In it contains three life-like dolls who he accidentally\

    short_description: When Reuben inherits his uncle's mansion, the last thing he
      expects is to find are sentient life-sized dolls that are capable of moving
      and talking. As if that isn't shocking enough, one of the dolls is a psychopathic
      killer who has her sights set on him! Will he survive or become another victim?
