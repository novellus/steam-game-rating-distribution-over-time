      /><br>This is a fantasy story about three heroes who became involved in the
      fight against hostile creatures. Where did they come from? What do they need?
      They must find answers to many questions and fight their source. Darkness is
      advancing into this world, and it will devour it if they just stand by and do
      nothing. Do you have what it takes to resist the armies of evil and liberate
      this land?'

    review: 'I have owned this game for at least six moths and today finally decided
      to play a bit.


      While graphically it''s not superb, it''s a VERY GOOD game indeed. Three different
      heroes, sixteen enemies - each single one with interesting and unique skills.
      The game itself is really challenging.


      One question - did anyone crack the third nest level (with Living Weapon)?'
