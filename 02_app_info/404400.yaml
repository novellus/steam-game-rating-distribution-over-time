    review: 'I love this game. The visuals are amazing, that''s needless to say. it''s
      exactly the reason why i bought it in first place. With such immersive visuals,
      I can''t help but look at the characters and the environment, and wonder, what
      brought them to killing each other in the first place?

      That is one way to improve it: add some cinematic, hints about the lore by implementing
      new game modes (solo, online) or new characters. Badblood feels empty after
      playing it, because it becomes somewhat of a repetitive experience. Sure, every
      gameplay varies because you don''t know if you''ll be able to strike the opponent
      this time, but then it just feels like a very small game.


      I watched Winnie Song''s talk about violence, and sure, her game it''s very
      violent. However, it has a lot of potential to express her message entirely,
      about how no one really wants to die and how violence is sometimes necessary.
      That''s my take, it''s a game with huge potential and i would definitely love
      to see it grow. i''m not sure if Song is still onto this proyect, but I absolutely
      still recommend it.'
