    review: "Better than I thought it was going to be interesting, has its problems\
      \ and I talk about them in Video. \nTake a trip through the Amazon while drinking\
      \ beer and laying on the couch in a run-down trailer in the middle of butt fuck\
      \ anywhere. What's not to like about that, I can see myself in another 10 years\
      \ going down to the local University giving lectures on all the places I have\
      \ visited in the world and are an expert on just from my couch.\n\nObviously\
      \ before being escorted off the campus and arrested for not being employed by\
      \ any institution and in fact not being employed for the past 30 years.\n\n\
