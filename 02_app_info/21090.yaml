    about_the_game: "Be the hero in your own cinematic epic of action, tension and\
      \ terror. A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar\
      \ aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands. The government\
      \ responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated.\
      \ Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing\
      \ the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite F.E.A.R. (First Encounter\
      \ Assault Recon) team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances.\
      \ They are given one simple mission: Evaluate the threat and eliminate the intruders\
      \ at any cost.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>F.E.A.R. Extraction Point</strong> Extraction\
      \ Point kicks off where the original game ended \u2013 with a bang. As the helicopter\
      \ which the F.E.A.R. team is on attempts to leave the vicinity, it instead winds\
      \ up crashing. The F.E.A.R. team is thus forced to seek out an alternate extraction\
      \ point, all the way battling the now free Alma and her paranormal minions across\
      \ a destroyed city.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate</strong>\
      \ As the first F.E.A.R. team and Delta Force fight for control of the situation,\
      \ a second F.E.A.R. team is sent in to shed some light on Armacham Technology\
      \ Corporation's (ATC) dark past. As a member of a secondary F.E.A.R. team, you\
      \ are brought in to discover more information regarding the secret project at\
      \ the ATC facilities. The multiplayer component for this expansion is no longer\
      \ available."
