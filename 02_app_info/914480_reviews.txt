This game is very hard for me but, at the same time, the challenge I'm facing isn’t frustrating. The graphics in this game are very realistic and believable and the characters are just freaking cute. I can only recommend this game and promise you that you will not regret it. Well, perhaps you are losing your time doing other things you should be doing because you got hooked in this game. lol!!!","timestamp_created":1537456979,"timestamp_updated":1537456979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.422336459159851074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w/fk++UCfdqFqwE="}
