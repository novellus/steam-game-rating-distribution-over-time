    reviews: "\u201CJust Flight has hit a home run with this Duchess 76 for Aerofly\
      \ FS2... No doubt, whatsoever, the envelope has been expanded, and more than\
      \ a little.  The bar is now set much higher than previously thought possible...\
      \ Very highly recommended... The Just Flight Duchess breaks new ground for Aerofly\
      \ FS2 with this fully capable IFR twin trainer... An absolute pleasure to fly\
      \ in the AFS2 scenery environment... This Just Flight Duchess 76 add on will\
      \ elevate the Aerofly FS2 sim in general... I\u2019m sure many of the AFS2 users\
      \ are only interested in the VR capabilities of the new Just Flight Duchess\
      \ for FS2.  I venture a guess that these folks will not be disappointed... The\
      \ panel layout, 3D gauges, rocker switches and large push button autopilot are\
      \ all VR friendly.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.avsim.com/home/reviews/aircraft/just-flight-duchess-model-76-aerofly-fs2-review-r5207/\"\

    short_description: The Duchess is a four-seater, twin-engine T-tail aircraft equipped
      with a retractable tricycle landing gear and two 180hp four-cylinder engines
      fitted with constant-speed propellers. Its IFR-capable avionics suite, excellent
      handling characteristics and counter-rotating propellers make it an ideal aircraft
      for multi-engine flight...

    review: "The Just Flight Duchess is a flawed masterpiece. The interior and exterior\
      \ detailing is exquisite, from the worn leather seats and authentic panel, to\
      \ the chocks and tie-downs. The flight characteristics feel right, although\
      \ I have not flown one in real life - you can feel the momentum, she accelerates\
      \ more slowly than the Turbo Arrow, and gets airborne almost grudgingly. However\
      \ once cleaned up, and having picked up flying speed, she climbs and cruises\
      \ effortlessly, with the two-axis autopilot relieving some of the pilot's workload\
      \ if desired. The instruments are generally excellent, and include a fully-functional\
      \ HSI. The Duchess is certainly harder to master than the Arrow - and so she\
      \ should be. \n\nThe flaws come in three forms: those that don't bother me,\
      \ those that do bother me, and one I quite enjoy! The parking brake does not\
      \ have any noticeable effect, and the engine sound changes in volume with power\
      \ but not in pitch with RPM. The electric trim switch on the yoke does not work,\
      \ and you cannot assign elevator trim to a controller knob as this overrides\
      \ the AP pitch management. However, these minor flaws are unobtrusive and insignificant.\
      \ \n\nThere are only two flaws that bother me. The first is the autopilot, which\
      \ is only partially functional, does not operate according to the Century IV\
      \ POH. Sometimes the AP appears to be in a mode other than that selected by\
      \ the pilot, even when the annunciator panel shows the selected mode. For example,\
      \ if you are cruising in altitude hold mode and then select attitude mode and\
      \ dial in some up- or down-trim to change altitude, then although the aircraft\
      \ initially trims as desired, it gradually returns to level flight instead of\
      \ maintaining the attitude commanded, and appears to still be in altitude hold\
      \ mode even though the annunciator shows \"ATT\". Sometimes the opposite occurs,\
      \ with the aircraft climbing or descending when set to and indicating altitude\
      \ hold. The correct annunciator lights do not illuminate during VOR, ILS and\
      \ glide-slope acquisition, and the AP will not set an intercept course if the\
      \ CDI/HSI indicates more than half-scale deflection. The REV (reverse localiser)\
      \ and GA (go-around) modes do not appear to work at all. The other AP functions\
      \ are usable, but are unreliable and misleading (which would be dangerous if\
      \ this was a real aircraft).  \n\nThe second flaw that bothers me is that the\
      \ GPS course cannot be coupled to the AP. You can set up a course in the FS2\
      \ Navigation screen, and the GPS will display the required track, and inform\
      \ you via messages, but I could not find a way to make the AP fly this track\
      \ automatically. You should be able to do this by pushing the CDI button on\
      \ the GNS-430 so \"GPS\" is displayed, but this has no effect. Which is strange,\
      \ since the GNS-430 feeds VOR nav information to the HSI, and the AP can be\
      \ coupled by selecting NAV mode; and in the Turbo Arrow, the GPS does couple\
      \ to the AP. These are particularly unfortunate flaws as with a properly functioning\
      \ AP that could be coupled to the GPS, the Duchess would make a wonderful touring\
      \ aircraft for longer cross-country flights. \n\nAnd the flaw that I enjoy?\
      \ The unrealistic cruise speed. This Duchess will cruise at 185 KTAS using the\
      \ Beechcraft POH recommended cruise power settings (f23.7 In. Hg., 2300 RPM)\
      \ at 6,000 ft. This is Baron territory - perhaps she's the Turbo Duchess that\
      \ Beechcraft never built!\n\nIt's a real shame that an aircraft this good is\
      \ let down by a few of serious flaws that should be easy to fix. I feel as though,\
      \ with a couple of weeks of extra effort, the Duchess could be perfect. I'll\
      \ update my review if any of these issues are resolved in future releases. \n\
      \nRecommended, but with reservations, and not for instrument flying."
