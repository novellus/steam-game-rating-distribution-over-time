    review: 'There''s a lot to do in this pack! Festivals, karaoke, drink, eat, swim
      in a high-rise pool, host parties at your place, etc. There are a lot of unique
      lots to experiment with and see what you like best. This pack works really well
      with the vampire pack, because the areas are very big and you can get around
      faster as a vampire. I honestly wish that all the activities were more centralized,
      rather than having to travel to other districts to go to the gym. Other than
      that, it''s a lot of fun!


      Definitely recommend.'
