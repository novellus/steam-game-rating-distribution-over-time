First of all its $10, in the state its in it shouldn't even cost $1, it has no audio or music at all, the tutorial and story modes are locked despite the game not even being an early access title and the entire game is just a hoarde mode thing where you just run around killing monsters. With a few youtube tutorials I could probably make this game myself in a few days. Definitely not worth playing.","timestamp_created":1540300331,"timestamp_updated":1540300331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54867255687713623","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1540362182,"developer_response":"Hi Lopper,\nI want to say thank you for trying Halloween Knight. I know that it did not live up to your expectations and for that I sincerely apologize. I made the mistake of not flagging this game as early access or Beta even and I cannot retroactively change it. I have mentioned here several times that it was not a completed game. \n\nObviously I don't blame you for not reading through every update or comment and I should have been more aware going into this that there was a box I left unchecked. So for that I really do apologize. Your complaints are not lost on me and I know that I have a lot of work to do and I am still working on this game daily. \n\nAs the sole developer it is taking more time than I would like to update as much as I want. I'm working on getting sound and getting other game modes made currently. I'm also working on more monsters and content. I know that doesn't mean much to you now, but hopefully some day you might be willing to give it another go. \n\nAgain, I really appreciate you trying it, your criticisms, and your time. I'm working hard to get this game to where it needs to be. Have a great Halloween!\n\nChris"}],"cursor":"AoJ4/7rD0OYCd5GarQE="}
