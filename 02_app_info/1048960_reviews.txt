You focus on an enemy by pressing F, once engaged with an enemy do left click for two hit light attack and right click for a single heavy attack, numbers are for magic spells if you got them. space to dodge, you have to dodge an enemy's attack then attack but they can dodge too. Unfortunately its only a robot design but modified into different enemies and NPCs and there arent that many npcs to talk to for hints. But the music is swell and if we could get some more enemy types besides robot with attack and robot with projectile, etc.\n\nThe low-poly style makes me feel like its a mix between lttp and oot. But that might just be due to see other games like it, also there are places you might get softlocked and if you try to quit your save then reload you'll just end up in the same softlocked position meaning you will have to delete your save.\n\nPlot is very vague and doesn't give you all the necessary steps to go to your objective which is the Tesseract in the temple. Plus the mystery alphabet language makes this even harder with no place to find where this alphabet system is early on, players will just stumble about.\n\nIf these were to be added and fixed the softlocks, etc. I'm certain the game could possibly be a lot popular + better, just my opinion.","timestamp_created":1608960809,"timestamp_updated":1608960809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4grPizvYCf62kvQI="}
