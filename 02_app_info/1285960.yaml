    about_the_game: The Ancient Art of Staying Alive is a highly customisable tea-break
      arcade game in which you play Hubert McCubert, a small blue cube looking for
      a quiet life who for some reason (*bonus feature* - make up your own reason!)
      attracts the attention of the evil Crimson Cube Posse.  Using his wits, cunning,
      agility and perhaps the odd teleporter or bomb, Hubert must stay alive while
      facing wave after wave of enemies all homing in on him at once...<br><br>Based
      on the old &quot;Daleks&quot; game, TAAOSA turns the concept into an arcade
      game.  Unashamedly retro in every aspect, if you want amazing visuals then look
      elsewhere, but if you want a simple, challenging game that's randomised every
      time you play it, you might just find this to be your cup of tea.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>-
      20 levels<br>- 5 game speeds<br>- (Challenge Mode (play through all levels in
      a single session)<br>- Player can be set to always moving to massively increased
      challenge!<br>- High score table<br>- Change your background colour to mimic
      the awful colour schemes of ancient consoles!<br>- Make the game easier with
      Teleports, Bombs and Obstacles - but be aware that these will affect your score...

    short_description: An arcade game in which the only goal is to stay alive by making
      your enemies crash into each other rather than you... which gets difficult as
      you can have hundreds of enemies homing in on you simultaneously!!
