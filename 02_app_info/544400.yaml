    review: "GUNGUNGUN is self-described as \u201Ca frantic bullet filled 2D arcade\
      \ arena shooter.\u201D Although the core gameplay is fun, the overall scope\
      \ of game is rather limited. Yet if you are in the mood for frantic fun in a\
      \ small package, this game might just be what you\u2019re looking for. With\
      \ a title like \u201CGUNGUNGUN,\u201D be ready for a fusillade of fun as you\
      \ shoot, dodge and rack up a bounty in this title.  \n\n\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\n\
      The Prologue is both a tutorial and the only real story bit you will ever receive\
      \ in the game. The female protagonist (whom I\u2019ve grown to call GIRLGIRLGIRL)\
      \ decides to steal from a group of presumed bandits but is caught in the act.\
      \ The bandits give chase as she scrambles aboard a nearby train to escape her\
      \ pursuers. This is a just framing device to explain the enemies and level theming.\n\
      \n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nIn this game, its all about the guns and shooting.\
      \ There are 8 different guns to collect and use, ranging from pistols to even\
      \ a heavy-duty rifle. You start out with your default USP9 pistol and can carry\
      \ any 1 other gun to fight back against the bandits. There are 4 enemy types\
      \ to fight in this game:\n[list][*]Bandits who use pistols and shotguns to shoot\
      \ at you\n[*]Knifers who charge in, swinging knives\n[*]Bombers who carry dangerous\
      \ TNT payloads\n[*]Heavies who can soak up 2 or more entire magazines before\
      \ dropping[/list]\nAlone, none are particularly dangerous. However, as an arcade\
      \ arena shooter, you will have to constantly deal with numerous of these enemy\
      \ types on screen at once. Each brings a unique threat and coming in groups\
      \ makes them even more dangerous. The game is thrilling as you try to last as\
      \ long as you can in a given stage.\n\nEach stage has a varying layout with\
      \ several platforms/ levels to stand on. Each platform is solid so good positioning\
      \ is a key as you cannot simply jump up or fall down/ through a platform. Enemies\
      \ will either parachute in, jump onto the train from horseback or even just\
      \ fall in from the sky. Each stage is made more engaging as platforms essentially\
      \ become death traps once enough enemies start pouring onto it and surrounding\
      \ you. Although holing up in a corner may be safe, can you kill enemies fast\
      \ enough to keep it that way? \n \nThe game has some neat features as well to\
      \ help make combat more fun. For example, you have an innate double jump to\
      \ avoid projectiles or get to higher platforms. You can shoot enemy projectiles\
      \ to destroy them and it only takes one shot to do so. You can crouch to avoid\
      \ bullets, but I scarcely used it. \n\nBeing an arcade game, the only real objective\
      \ is to see how high you can get your score. In that regard, once you play a\
      \ few rounds you see everything the game has to offer unfortunately.\n\nLikewise,\
      \ there are a few game design decisions that make gameplay a bit frustrating.\
      \ Firstly, you cannot switch your default USP9 for any of the other handgun-type\
      \ guns. It is mostly there as a reserve gun, but it is outclassed by every other\
      \ gun in the game. I seldom used it outside of the first few seconds of a level\
      \ or for the related achievements. \n\nReloading is manual only. However, I\
      \ see this as more of an intentional choice for realism.\n\nNext, you pick up\
      \ guns by simply walking over them. The headache is that you cannot CHOOSE when\
      \ to pick up a weapon; you will automatically ditch your equipped gun if you\
      \ make contact with a new one\u2019s hitbox. This means that you may accidentally\
      \ throw away a weapon you like because you had to relocate and run over a gun\
      \ drop (which is very frequent occurrence). Compounding onto this, you must\
      \ wait out each reload fully, even if you switch weapons mid-reload and the\
      \ new magazine/ chamber is full. \n\nThe conditions for health pack spawns are\
      \ also mysterious if not inconsistent. Sometimes I play a level and none spawn\
      \ at all. Sometimes I get 2-3 within minutes of each other. In a game with limited\
      \ hitpoints and infinite enemies, it honestly feels like RNG if I would survive\
      \ longer than 5 minutes. Additionally, health packs despawn over time and are\
      \ auto-consumed upon contact. Thus, getting a health pack is even more annoying\
      \ as you can\u2019t properly ration them out.       \n\nNevertheless, GUNGUNGUN\
      \ is a game I can pick up at anytime and have fun due to the simple yet engaging\
      \ gameplay loop. This is a game that definitely tests your skills and reflexes.\n\
      \n\n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\nOverall, I think the pixel art is pretty good. It is\
      \ very abundantly clear who/ where your character is and what type of enemy\
      \ is on screen. The train cars/ levels are believable and have realistic designs.\
      \ Backgrounds seem to have received less attention but each is distinct from\
      \ the others. The gun designs are excellently crafted and truly reflect their\
      \ real-world counterparts. Bullets are distinct and you can see when one is\
      \ coming at you. \n\nThere is even a hat store where you can trade in the gold\
      \ coins you receive at the end of every mission. The hat economy seems unnecessarily\
      \ grindy for the bottom row as they cost several hundreds of thousands of coins\
      \ to purchase. To put this in perspective, you usually receive around a thousand\
      \ gold per level assuming you perform well. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that\
      \ there isn\u2019t more full art of the characters which is very cute and expressive.\
      \ \n\n I liked the snow stage the least because the yellow bullets are hard\
      \ to distinguish against the pure-white background that is constantly scrolling\
      \ by. \n\nThe game has an innate camera shake to it to simulate firing a real\
      \ gun, but sometimes it is a bit too much and I start to feel dizzy/ nauseous\
      \ after extended play. I wish there was an option to toggle it on/off or at\
      \ least lessen it. \n\n\n\n[h1]AUDIO[/h1]\nThere are only a handful of 8/16-bit\
      \ musical tracks to listen to, but they are all pretty good and have an energetic\
      \ feel to them. However, they are all loops and a bit short. \n\nThe gunshot\
      \ sounds are very well-crafted and I could feel the passion put behind them.\
      \ They all sound distinct and satisfying to shoot. The other sound effects are\
      \ also quite good. \n\n\n\n[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]\nThe game ran perfectly well\
      \ for me. However, there isn't a dedicated pause button. Pressing Escape simply\
      \ terminates the current session and brings you to the main menu without your\
      \ post-round rewards. As an arcade game, I am split on this decision. \n\nKeys\
      \ can't be rebound nor can you preview controller layouts. Discovering the controls\
      \ is purely trial and error.\n\nSteam screenshots also seem to not work for\
      \ some reason so I unfortunately can't share mine here.\n\n\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\n\
      As \u201Ca frantic bullet filled 2D arcade arena shooter,\u201D I feel that\
      \ the game definitely delivers what it is advertised as. Gameplay is very tense\
      \ yet fun due to the endless hoard of enemies and colorful variety of guns at\
      \ your disposal. I commend the developer for their vision to keep said guns\
      \ accurate to their real-world counterparts. Nonetheless, there are some game\
      \ design blemishes that impacted my overall enjoyment of the game. \n\nYet for\
      \ a small game at a reasonable price, I can definitely say \u201Cgive it a whirl\u201D\
      \ if arcade shooters are your thing. \n\n\n\n[h1][b]7.5/10\nWORTH A LOOK[/b][/h1]\n\
