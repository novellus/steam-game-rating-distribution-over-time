My only complaint is that imho some puzzles were too difficult (in easy mode.) The two walkthrough I found on YouTube end right at the point where it became (overly?) difficult. That said, I'm not a puzzle person and you might find them simple. \n\nThe setting and characters are charming and you'll also have a school-like learning experience. \n\nI did not mind the \"slideshow presentation\" at all. I felt it was one of the ways the game entertained with subtle humor. \n\nI'll be looking for more games by this team.\n\nHooray to FMV","timestamp_created":1606397837,"timestamp_updated":1606397985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4joCygvYCcrersgI="}
