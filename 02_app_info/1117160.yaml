      \ on Earth and unhappy with the opportunities nations offer souls to grow, our\
      \ hero, Kanli (you) is offered a chance to .. do better.<br>He will try, over\

      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>13 ideas that we explore in Minds of Nations </strong>\
      \  </h2><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 The Nation as a school for souls</h2>\
      \ </strong><br><br>    You play the custodian of a state through millennia.\
      \ The nation is both a state in the classical sense, <br>    but also a school\
      \ for souls that are interested in overcoming this plane.<br><br>    You have\
      \ to consider strength, the material needs of a community and the evolutionary\
      \ needs the souls that take birth in your realm have. A sluggish state will\
      \ have them stuck for centuries into the same thoughts, fears and vices. While\
      \ a weak state may not provide enough bodies or opportunities in life.<br><br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">2  Religion as the development of methods, not a popularity\
      \ contest</h2></strong><br><br>    Incarnated or not, souls generate ideas for\
      \ you. Ideas are of three types:<br><br>    The first is the spiritual path\
      \ that your nation discovers.<br>    Ascetics tired of the endless cycle of\
      \ birth-rebirth and desire-aversion, are developing methods for transcending\
      \ this plane of existence.<br><br>    So they develop the stages of concentration,\
      \ reflections, prayers, mantras, breathing and other techniques for purifying\
      \ consciousness.<br><br>    It does not matter how many people adhere to the\
      \ path your ascetics uncover. It is NOT about having many provinces declaring\
      \ themselves Catholic, but rather, having a path that frees more persons from\
      \ the chains of desire, hatred. Having more methods that incorporate different\
      \ mindsets, that free one from all attachments and bonds<br><br>.<img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3  Governance as a collection of answers\
      \ to society's questions</h2></strong><br><br>    Instead of having broad systems\
      \ like Communism, Monarchy, or Democracy, you use ideas to answer each individual\
      \ governance questions like:<br><br>    &quot;Who leads our nation ?&quot;<br>\
      \        - It can be 1 person, it can be three, it can be a couple, it can be\
      \ a council..<br>    &quot;How is that person chosen ?&quot;<br>       - Leadership\
      \ can be inherited, elected by others and then you'd have to choose who can\
      \ elect your leader. Only landowners ? Everyone older than 14 ? <br><br>   \
      \    -Or, your leaders can also be selected in more unorthodox ways:<br>   \
      \           - You can go the Athenian way and choose them by sortition, randomly.<br>\
      \              - You can go the Tang Dynasty way and have examinations.<br>\
      \                         - Then, you select the exam subjects. <br>       \
      \                       - Moralism ?<br>                              - Science\
      \ ?<br>                              - Archery ?<br><br>     Alternatively,\
      \ if none of these options fit your vision, you can create really custom systems.\
      \ Maybe you believe that the leader should be selected after a death match or\
      \ some other way. You can add this custom option.<br>     <br>     We approach\
      \ every issue of community management in the same way, from economics to the\
      \ justice system.<br>     <br>     And many other options giving you complete\
      \ control.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-2.jpg?t=1586914262\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4   Effects that change over time</h2></strong><br><br>\
      \     If you switch to an authoritarian regime, in the short run, changing government\
      \ policies will be cheaper. But, in the long run, after the first generation\
      \ of rulers die, corruption and nepotism will increase significantly.<br><br>\
      \     Or, if you grant women access to office. You'll have a gradual increase\
      \ in ideas, but a gradual decrease in natality. Less children per woman.<br><br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">5  Effects that change based ON your production of their\
      \ associated resources. </h2></strong><br>     For example: you can get a one\
      \ time bonus equal to 10 times your yearly food production. That way it is has\
      \ value to you both in the early game and in the late game.<br><br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">6   Algorithms that try to incorporate a bit of realism</h2></strong><br><br>\
      \     The algorithm for food is divided into 3 parts. Food produced - food consumed\
      \ - food wasted.<br><br>     Each working person: based on tech, knowledge of\
      \ the technology throughout your state, and other datapoints - produce a number\
      \ of kilograms of food per acre. Soil quality is also involved as &quot;province\
      \ fertility&quot;.<br><br>     Consumption and food wasted, are based on the\
      \ diet your economy and govt. encourage plus other options. A vegetarian diet\
      \ will mean less food is consumed but more is wasted. A carnivorous diet will\
      \ also give you a slight military bonus. etc.<br><br>     Everything matters.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-6-algos.jpg?t=1586914262\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">7  Technology as a number of general\
      \ subjects and not as a tech tree</h2></strong><br>     <br>     We take a more\
      \ general approach to technology, instead of individual discoveries, technologies\
      \ are grouped into their parent subjects:<br>     <br>          - Biology &amp;\
      \ medical, chemistry &amp; materials, math &amp; economy, physics and engineering.<br><br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">8   Armies have to carry food and soldiers are recruited\
      \ from the labor force</h2></strong><br>     <br>     You need to carefuly watch\
      \ your armies' food supplies, as they may disband before reaching their destination.\
      \ Also, when an army goes to war, it takes with it a significant part of the\
      \ labour force - decreasing the food production at home.<br><br>     You can\
      \ set your nation back centuries by taking an ill-advised opponent to war and\
      \ having most of your working men die of starvation in enemy territory.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-7-food.PNG?t=1586914262\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">9  War, lies &amp; propaganda</h2></strong><br><br>\
      \     We explore the way politics has been poisoning our mindstream for millennia.\
      \ Spinning half truths into rigid dogma and encouraging us and our ancestors\
      \ to commit various atrocities.<br><br>     In preparation of a war, you can\
      \ claim the opponent's territories on the global stage. Then, to declare war,\
      \ you have to choose an exterior cassus belli - what other global actors will\
      \ be told about this conflict - the &quot;just cause&quot;.<br><br>     You\
      \ can claim that your &quot;holy&quot; traditions will liberate the pagan world,\
      \ that you're bringing freedom to their people tired of the tyrant's yoke, that\
      \ your ethnic minorities are oppressed and you're just trying to protect them,\
      \ that your ancestral lands are being occupied, that you have the mandate of\
      \ heaven for the unification of the world.<br>     Each cassus belli limits\
      \ the demands that you can have after the war.<br><br>     You also have to\
      \ choose an interior propaganda - what you tell your own people. You can tell\
      \ them that the other nation's soldiers are barbarians, cannibals, that they\
      \ have infiltrated our government and are running our nation from the shadows,\
      \ that their traditions are a threat to our freedoms or.. you can be honest\
      \ and just explain that we need more territory.<br><br>     The more hatred\
      \ your lies inspire, the bigger the military bonus. However, a lie will have\
      \ a negative effect on your nation's production of ideas and other karmic effects.\
      \ Millions of minds repeating a lie for ages: that's not profitable. Or is it\
      \ ?<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">10  Karmic years &amp; soul cycles</h2></strong><br>\
      \ <br>     We try to incorporate the idea of karma into wars. A nation that\
      \ attacks will get years added to the time needed for its souls to pass through\
      \ each independent evolutionary stage. This means that fewer new ideas will\
      \ appear in your state due to the emotional traumas caused in the conflict.<br><br>\
      \     We have 3 evolutionary stages:<br>     1. Common souls - only interested\
      \ in themselves and only contribute ideas to the day-to-day category.<br>  \
      \   2. Noble souls \u2013 which are common souls that have gone through multiple\
      \ experiences and have now turned their minds towards science, community and\
      \ government. They now contribute ideas to the governance category too.<br>\
      \     3. Ascetics \u2013 after noble souls give all they can to the scientific\
      \ fields and community, they turn their minds to more, to trasncendence. And\
      \ then uncover the spiritual methods that free us all.<br><br>     Once their\
      \ interior work is completed ascetics are freed and leave our world.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-5-karmic.jpg?t=1586914262\"\
      \ /><br><br>    <br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">11  Astral plane management</h2></strong><br><br>\
      \     You can limit incarnations in the astral plane tab. You can forbid beings\
      \ ridden with vices and desires from being born into ruling families. This will\
      \ improve the way in which the nation is ran but will decrease the common soul's\
      \ evolution speed because you're denying them leadership experiences. But imagine\
      \ someone only being interested in themselves being given the keys to the world..\
      \ They might use the entire national treasury for their own personal gain while\
      \ the many suffer. Is this a risk you are willing to take ?<br><br>     You\
      \ can also allow Artificial Intelligence incarnations. <br>     This will essentially\
      \ permit an A.I. to incarnate as one of your citizens and perform tasks or serve\
      \ purposes that most souls would outright refuse. Endless possibilities.<br><br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">12 Free-to-play continents, custom wonders, heraldry and\
      \ more</h2></strong><br> <br>You can fly a banner with custom heraldic elements\
      \ that are not found in Europe in the Middle Ages.<br><br>You can also build\
      \ new wonders - enough with the eiffel tower.<br><br>Every simulation includes\
      \ continents that have no microtransactions. 100% free. However, their total\
      \ capacity is limited. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-3-iap.jpg?t=1586914262\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">13 Climate change</h2></strong><br><br>The\
      \ game simulates the effect that large, monocultural, agrarian societies have\
      \ had on the environment.<br>Just as some ancient civilizations had fallen on\
      \ Terra due to bad soil management, your state will be at risk if you ignore\
      \ the issue. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-13-climate-change.PNG?t=1586914262\"\

      \ be told about this conflict - the &quot;just cause&quot;.<br><br>     You\
      \ can claim that your &quot;holy&quot; traditions will liberate the pagan world,\
      \ that you're bringing freedom to their people tired of the tyrant's yoke, that\
      \ your ethnic minorities are oppressed and you're just trying to protect them,\
      \ that your ancestral lands are being occupied, that you have the mandate of\
      \ heaven for the unification of the world.<br>     Each cassus belli limits\
      \ the demands that you can have after the war.<br><br>     You also have to\
      \ choose an interior propaganda - what you tell your own people. You can tell\
      \ them that the other nation's soldiers are barbarians, cannibals, that they\
      \ have infiltrated our government and are running our nation from the shadows,\
      \ that their traditions are a threat to our freedoms or.. you can be honest\
      \ and just explain that we need more territory.<br><br>     The more hatred\
      \ your lies inspire, the bigger the military bonus. However, a lie will have\
      \ a negative effect on your nation's production of ideas and other karmic effects.\
      \ Millions of minds repeating a lie for ages: that's not profitable. Or is it\
      \ ?<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">10  Karmic years &amp; soul cycles</h2></strong><br>\
      \ <br>     We try to incorporate the idea of karma into wars. A nation that\
      \ attacks will get years added to the time needed for its souls to pass through\
      \ each independent evolutionary stage. This means that fewer new ideas will\
      \ appear in your state due to the emotional traumas caused in the conflict.<br><br>\
      \     We have 3 evolutionary stages:<br>     1. Common souls - only interested\
      \ in themselves and only contribute ideas to the day-to-day category.<br>  \
      \   2. Noble souls \u2013 which are common souls that have gone through multiple\
      \ experiences and have now turned their minds towards science, community and\
      \ government. They now contribute ideas to the governance category too.<br>\
      \     3. Ascetics \u2013 after noble souls give all they can to the scientific\
      \ fields and community, they turn their minds to more, to trasncendence. And\
      \ then uncover the spiritual methods that free us all.<br><br>     Once their\
      \ interior work is completed ascetics are freed and leave our world.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br>    <br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">11  Astral plane management</h2></strong><br><br>\
      \     You can limit incarnations in the astral plane tab. You can forbid beings\
      \ ridden with vices and desires from being born into ruling families. This will\
      \ improve the way in which the nation is ran but will decrease the common soul's\
      \ evolution speed because you're denying them leadership experiences. But imagine\
      \ someone only being interested in themselves being given the keys to the world..\
      \ They might use the entire national treasury for their own personal gain while\
      \ the many suffer. Is this a risk you are willing to take ?<br><br>     You\
      \ can also allow Artificial Intelligence incarnations. <br>     This will essentially\
      \ permit an A.I. to incarnate as one of your citizens and perform tasks or serve\
      \ purposes that most souls would outright refuse. Endless possibilities.<br><br><strong><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">12 Free-to-play continents, custom wonders, heraldry and\
      \ more</h2></strong><br> <br>You can fly a banner with custom heraldic elements\
      \ that are not found in Europe in the Middle Ages.<br><br>You can also build\
      \ new wonders - enough with the eiffel tower.<br><br>Every simulation includes\
      \ continents that have no microtransactions. 100% free. However, their total\
      \ capacity is limited. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-3-iap.jpg?t=1586914262\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">13 Climate change</h2></strong><br><br>The\
      \ game simulates the effect that large, monocultural, agrarian societies have\
      \ had on the environment.<br>Just as some ancient civilizations had fallen on\
      \ Terra due to bad soil management, your state will be at risk if you ignore\
      \ the issue. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1117160/extras/desc-13-climate-change.PNG?t=1586914262\"\
