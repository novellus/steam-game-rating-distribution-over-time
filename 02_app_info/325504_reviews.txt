But I couldn't find good documentation, specifically no reference of any sort being available outside of the code itself, and an outdated PDF that had been apparently intentionally unpublished later, With the time spent just to understand the code, I felt like I might as well just write my own custom UI code, and it really wasn't what I thought I was buying either. In overall, I don't really understand why you'd buy this if you know how to code since writing your own UI tweaks isn't that hard, and if you don't know how to code this is probably not useful to you either.\n\nDisclaimer: it has been a while since I tried it though, so if the documentation has improved maybe this might be worth it to you","timestamp_created":1599446076,"timestamp_updated":1599446660,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuuacs/QCfeeloAI="}
