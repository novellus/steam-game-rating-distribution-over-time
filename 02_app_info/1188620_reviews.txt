I personally found alot of tracks that I'm using as new BGM.\n\nOnly problem is, that few of the listed games seem to be Sci-Fi themed, so most of their soundtrack might not really fit to the atmosphere of Atelier Ryza. Their still really enjoyable to listen to, so it's nice to have them.\n\nOverall, I'd say the DLC is pretty neat.","timestamp_created":1585490452,"timestamp_updated":1585490452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4oumk/ECd9GO/AE="}
