    review: "If I had to describe Magical x Spiral in a single word, it would have\
      \ to be \"Charming.\"\n\nYou start off playing as Medianne Phirti, a sweet girl\
      \ who yearns to be a part of a magical world. Even if it's a childish goal,\
      \ it's her heart's wish all the same. \nIn pursuit of that dream, she finds:\
      \ the Tower, an ancient proving ground to determine who is worthy to enter the\
      \ magical land of Celestria; and Salamander, an adorable magical being who teaches\
      \ her the beginnings of magic.\nTogether, they face the Tower's trials, add\
      \ other magical beings to the party, and gradually discover the truth behind\
      \ why Celestria separated from the mundane world so long ago...\n\n\nCharming.\n\
      The characters are lovable and the story is classic.\nFully voiced in Japanese,\
      \ and decently translated into English. Nearly every input you make will have\
      \ a corresponding response from your character.\nIt's gameplay is rather straightforward.\
      \ Climb the 2.5D spiraling tower. Fight or avoid the enemies in your way. I\
      \ especially like to find ways to chain spells to rocket around the tower super\
      \ fast. (Your character's face on the HUD will change expressions based on what\
      \ your doing or what they're saying. It's a very simple detail, but it's just\
      \ too cute.)\nThe animations are a little wonky, but honestly that just makes\
      \ it even more charming to me.\n\nThis game didn't screw with my brain, yank\
      \ the rug out from under me with groundbreaking twists in the narrative, or\
      \ depress me with a nihilistic world of living death. \n10/10\nI absolutely\
      \ recommend this game."
