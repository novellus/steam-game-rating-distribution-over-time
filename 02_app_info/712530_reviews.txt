Game even suggests that the delay can be fixed by restarting the game in the dialogue of the game.\nMovement and jumping feels clunky.\nMost traps are unavoidable. They appear and hit you without any warning.\nThere's no way to block against enemies so when you attack you just have to take a hit.\nYou hit a game blocking bug about 10 levels in when you get a new ability for your spear. The game gives you 1 shot with it to defeat one enemy but no way to recharge it.\nLevels all look the same and play the same.","timestamp_created":1601721281,"timestamp_updated":1601721281,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532163739204406738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nuWB9/QCfcDKpQI="}
