      \ resale\" etc, so 115 pages of Characters [each page consist's of 1 character,\
      \ with 4 diff \"versions\" or whatever, left being most clothes, right being\
      \ least clothes and a blush/etc face.][/b] \n[b]-\"rough Sketches\" Contains\
      \ 18 pages, 2 being the Front and back cover, and the second to last page is\
      \ the Ideafactory stuff, and saying \"not for resale\" etc, so 15 pages of sketch's.\
      \ Character sketches span 12 pages, where as background art/etc span 3 pages.[/b]\
      \ \n\n[h1]Wallpapers:[/h1]\n[b]PC WALLPAPERS[/b] \n-Contains 6 wallpapers, at\
      \ 3 different resolutions (1280x720), (1600x900), (1920x1080). [max size is\
      \ 1.32MB, lowest is 358KB]\n\n[h1]OST:[/h1]\n[b]-One folder of 24 tracks, and\
      \ a OP and a ED track, the 24 tracks goes as follows:[/b]\n1.) Battle of Yafaniel\n\
      2.) Mother Nature Royal\n3.) Hell Kill Fear Confusion\n4.) Irulapirika\n5.)\
      \ Ki Outo Girl\n6.) Hard Luck Dance\n7.) Salamandra\n8.) Last\uFF65City\n9.)\

      ED.)Feeling Your Heart_Short\n\n[h1]MY THOUGHTS[/h1]\n[b]General thoughts[/b]Personally,\
      \ I think $10 for this is WAYYYYY too expensive, so, I would ONLY recommend\
      \ it when it's on sale, as (at the moment of posting this review) it's been\
      \ as low as $1.99. [Mostly everything it provides, i would say is \"MEH\", but\
      \ if Your fave thing is how they don't have much clothes, the card gallery might\
      \ entice you i guess]\n\n[b]Artbook[/b] The Sketches were pretty \"MEH\", The\
      \ Digital Card gallery was Decent >.> I would prefer it be a higher MB so if\
      \ i want to zoom in and see *stuff* i could, as at 100% view (aka natural) You\
      \ can see the jaggedness/etc, so to zoom out and see a page your at 33%-50%.\
      \ \n\n[b]Wallpapers:[/b] Their all a big \"MEH\". The Otton one was decently\
      \ cute i guess. Would be better if they had expanded the background of the characters\
      \ in the card gallery, and put those in the wallpapers section also."
