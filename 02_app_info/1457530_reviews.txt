There are three cities on the same map, so you have a lot of distance to cover.  This leads to a lot of building and planning.  If you've completed all the other scenarios on normal difficulty, this won't be too taxing.  Have not yet tried on expert difficulty, which should ramp up the challenge significantly.\n\nThe developer has obviously put a lot of effort into this game.  The big map is both fun and visually rewarding.  It feels more like a miniature world, whereas the previous ones felt more like one small city.  Also nice to see some new buildings, stations, car bridges and terrain.  Hard to find a better value at just a couple dollars.  You'll reach that payback in the first 5 minutes of play.","timestamp_created":1605753972,"timestamp_updated":1605753972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0qSZ7/UCcYudrwI="}
