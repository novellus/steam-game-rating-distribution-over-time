    review: 'Sims 3 is the horse game that we always wanted and never got. The ability
      to create realistic and functional stables and equestrian facilities is a feature
      I''ve never seen in any of the "serious" horsie games, especially if you utilize
      some of the numerous high-quality mods that are available on the internet. Within
      the same vein is the horse customization and genetics. While not necessarily
      realistic, I enjoy the way the game passes down the phenotype of the parents
      to the foal.


      The other pets are fun too, and there are so many "minor" pets to choose from
      including parrots that you can train, but if you collect too many it will definitely
      slow your progression because they take so much time just like they do in real
      life. My suggestion for overcoming that is add another Sim to your household
      whose only job is to care for the pets. While it''s always great to get a DLC
      that''s on sale, this is one I don''t feel bad about paying full price for.'
