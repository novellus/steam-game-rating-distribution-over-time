In fact, it's one of my all-time favorites--up there with the best of the Cotton series and Deathsmiles. It has bright, colorful graphics, an amazing soundtrack, interesting game play, lots of modes, and funny and charming characters. Best of all, for a casual player like me, it has unlimited continues, so I can work my through this challenging game. I like this game so much that since I discovered it a few months ago, I've supported the developers by buying the two physical versions, along with the special \"Eternal\" edition at Beep.","timestamp_created":1609472148,"timestamp_updated":1609472148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwooCB3vYCdOakvwI="}
