    review: "So this game is obviously made by a small, low budget team just starting\
      \ out and looking to gain experience and expand their resume. So this review\
      \ will be written accepting that fact. It's like not like I'm critiquing a AAA\
      \ studio here. With that outta the way, let's get into it. \n\nThis is a 2D\
      \ game purely built around platforming, weapons, and it's enemies. Meaning there\
      \ is really no story. Just your run of the mill simple objective of beating\
      \ the big bad guy at the end. Which is disappointing.  Because in games like\
      \ this, a decent story would do alot to help lift it up above many others of\
      \ it's kind. Some characters. Some backstory. Some speech bubbles. Some proper\
      \ motivations as to why this quest is being embarked on. \n\nSo you're just\
      \ left with these levels and the gameplay that they bring. The platforming side\
      \ of it was pretty good at times, but I was often reminded that I'm playing\
      \ as a stiff and frigid character. There were some cool elements like fans and\
      \ lava spits. Classic things like spikes. I got impressed when all those things\
      \ started getting combined to make traps. I got hurt so much lol. It got really\
      \ hard, especially that damned ice level, but as a result, it did feel accomplishing\
      \ to beat it all. I particularly thought the worm level was creative and fresh.\
      \ To navigate, you had to keep changing size, which I enjoyed. The void irritated\
      \ me though. I hated having to traverse platforming just to get to the next\
      \ level. And the ice slide series part made me super duper pissed me off. I\
      \ was stuck at that part for like 10 minutes just trying to get to the next\
      \ level. The ice level itself was also frustrating because of the character\
      \ stiffness. A fluidly moving character would of made that level much more enjoyable.\n\
      \nThe weapons side of things was a very cool concept. To overcome something\
      \ in a level and then be able to use it from there on out as a weapon is beautiful\
      \ way to provide progression to the character. Especially the shrink ray lol.\
      \ However, I only ever really used the base gun, the banana gun (for health),\
      \ and the bomb. I found all the others to be kinda useless since I could deal\
      \ with any situation adequately with the 3 weapons I used during my playthrough.\
      \ This may change in new game plus, idk, but I definitely didn't feel inclined\
      \ to use any of the other guns in a first playthrough. Oh and my least favorite\
      \ was the wind gun. Maybe I wasn't keen enough on how to use it well, but I\
      \ thought it was absolutely useless. \n\nNow for the enemies. All very, very\
      \ unique from eachother. But the best way to defeat most of em was from a distance\
      \ with the base gun. The enemies had the most impact when combined with platforming\
      \ sequences. That made them very dangerous and I thought that was smart design.\
      \ The same way different platforming elements kept getting combined with eachother\
      \ to create new obstacles. The bosses are a different story though. I think\
      \ they all were pretty cool. Some left a more lasting impression on me than\
      \ others. Some could you just kinda stand there and spam the base weapon on\
      \ them. And if you got hurt too much, just banana gun yourself. Others required\
      \ some strategy and patience. Like the ice boss, lava boss, and the Drakken\
      \ of course. Drakken was the hardest as he should be! I died like 6 times to\
      \ him. Thankfully I had farmed over 20 lives in the worm level lol. If I hadn't\
      \ I would not have beaten this game today. Or tomorrow lol. Drakken was VERY\
      \ well designed. It's clear alot of effort went into him. And the concept of\
      \ him taking half your arsenal away was terrifying and cool at the same time.\
      \ Especially when he was using those very weapons on you. I loved it. Just that\
      \ boss fight redeemed alot of other shortcomings for me. \n\nSadly though, there\
      \ was nothing after that besides new game plus. No cutscene or text. Which adds\
      \ to my lack of story point. In conclusion, I am very proud of this team sticking\
      \ around for the long hull and finishing this. A finished and working product\
      \ is a feat in itself and I commend you guys. Not even the AAA studios released\
      \ finished products these days. Taking into account all circumstances previously\
      \ mentioned, I give this a game a score of 7 out of 10. I may try out new game\
      \ plus to experiment and see if I'm forced to use the other weapons more. If\
      \ anything significant comes out of it, I'll update my review and also with\
      \ anything I forgot. Thanks for reading!!\n\nEdit: I forgot to address music\
      \ and visuals of the game! The music was great! Each level had a unique track\
      \ that fit very well with it's setting. So 2 thumbs ups for that. The visuals\
      \ were better than I expected given that it's a 2D game. The character look\
      \ doesn't leave me with any comments, but the background and look of the levels\
      \ was not bad. I loved the scale of the last level. It felt large and epic like\
      \ a castle should, also fitting to it's place as a last level. Sometimes the\
      \ game was even kinda pleasing to look at. "
