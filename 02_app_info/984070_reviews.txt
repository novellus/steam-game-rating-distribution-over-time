I spawned in a castle surrounded by characters, tall and short alike. That's all I know to do, which was nothing. Explored a bit, entered a house then practiced punching. Ended up fazing right through a wall and falling out of the game. All in all, it was $3.78 and worth allot of laughs. I've been reading the comments since this game was released and figured Iâ€™d give it a go in hopes for improvement. I sadly discovered this game is more of a gag to play than anything else. Recommending this to those wanting a good laugh.","timestamp_created":1571247916,"timestamp_updated":1571247916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvpDr6u0CeNub1AE="}
