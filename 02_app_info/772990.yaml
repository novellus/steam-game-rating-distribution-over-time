    review: 'I''ve been reading other reviews about this walking simulator yesterday,
      which most of them was negative. I gave this a chance to understand why this
      was a waste of both time and money. I understand this more after completing
      the game.


      First of all, this game has not much to offer than just a walking simulator
      with a relaxing music theme. The voice acting is very bland where the pronouncing
      of certain english words are done in a really bad way. It''s alright if the
      company itself is east european, but the voice actress has too many pauses in
      the sentences which ruins the mood of being interested in the actual story.


      The story itself isn''t bad but it lost its touch because of the lack of exploration
      and the monologues was unclear in the context of the case the female narrator
      is telling us. I wish I liked it more.


      It''s a okay walking simulator overall, but could''ve been much better if better
      voice acting and more exploration. Play Firewatch instead, which has more to
      offer than this straight forward walking simulator.'
