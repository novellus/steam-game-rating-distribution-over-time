    review: I liked the visuals of the film. The overall story line was good, very
      hopeful, and it did a good job building suspense. Some of the dialogue and voice
      acting between the protagonist and the secondary characters could use some improvement
      to make the scences more impactful. Overall I would recommend this film, if
      your looking for something short and entertaining.
