    review: ' A zelda inspired indie thats in-game world resets every 20 minutes,
      at first I really liked it. but after the second reset I just could not be bothered
      to continue. the islands are to spread out with progress/hints being so annoyingly
      vague I felt like my time was just being wasted. the pixel visuals are cute
      but the charm wheres of fast same with the music there is one good track in
      game (you know what i am talking about) the rest of the in game music is offensively
      bad. Try it if your really looking for a cheap game but I feel that this is
      asking for to much of the players time with how basic its Mechanics GameplayLoop
      is.'
