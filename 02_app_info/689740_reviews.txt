I just can't stand it anymore. basically, the player can \"buy\" bonuses ingame with money earned while playing.\nWhile it's not real money, it still feels wrong to me, as far as I am concerned. This is basically a chance game where origanization and skills have little impact. \"Buying\" stuff will lead the player to have extra bonuses ingame.\n\nAnyway, it's still an OK game, considering the price.\n\nI've played this for a little more than 2 hours without problem on Win 7 64 bit.","timestamp_created":1543176493,"timestamp_updated":1543176493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540970742702484131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/JKfpucCdq+YswE="}
