The tracks are very varied and there are real highlights among them. After the purchase, a new directory will automatically be created in your local Steam folder containing every single track from every table. All songs are nicely sorted by table and easy to find. So you have the opportunity to hear the songs in full and not just a fraction. I like the kind of music very much and by buying it you show that you support the composer and the developer.","timestamp_created":1605615744,"timestamp_updated":1605615744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwP6J6/UCdef2rgI="}
