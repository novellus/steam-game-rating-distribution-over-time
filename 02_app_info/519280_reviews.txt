He explains why underestanding object's shape as the whole is preferable to simply copying it from a fixed angle. Kalen demonstrates his method of studying art, where he answers what makes a particular scenary interesting and experiments with its elements to see how exactly it works. The method is easy to underestand and implement right way. It does not have specific rules and can be modified to suit one's goals and desires. Rather than showing an exact way to study, Kalen encourages better underestanding of objects around through research. Overall, lecture provides practical advice for beginners. I am not sure how useful it would be for advanced artists who have figured their own way of studying, though. The lesson taught is not self-evident and is worth the price it asks.\n\nOn the other hand, the preparation before recording the lecture could be better. Background rap music is unneccesary, annoying, and has vocals. It struck me as unprofessional and negligent. It set low expectations for the content to be presented. I wasn't sure whenever I want to hear what Kalen has to say, especially with the dry, somewhat rigid, start of the video. However, as the lecture went, Kalen became more talkative and entranced by his craft. He was able to hold my attention to the very end and I was satisfied with the knowledge I received. For potential viewers, I recommend to bear with bumpy beginning of the good ride, and for Kalen Chock to reconsider his choice of background music to something more subtle and warm up before recording.\n\nA  suitable purchase for beginner artists.","timestamp_created":1577622146,"timestamp_updated":1606834097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ttGxj/YCdvyF6AE="}
