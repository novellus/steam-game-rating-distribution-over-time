    review: "One of the very bad games that I have in my library. Obviously needs\
      \ you to have at least four eyes to play this properly. I never understand why\
      \ put in the VAR when you clearly know it is not gonna help at all. Honestly,\
      \ I did not know about this being a BigAnt studios game, else I would have never\
      \ brought it. I have played the cricket games by them and they are atrocious\
      \ enough. \n\nIf you have an expensive gamepad and you are prone to outbursts\
      \ as the game is too stupid, save your money and invest on something else and\
      \ keep your gamepad/controller intact. This game ain't fun at all. Fifteen matches\
      \ down in the career mode and I was twitching to write a review. Give this a\
      \ skip, even the FIFA from EA sports is better and that is saying something."
