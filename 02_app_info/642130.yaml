    short_description: It's almost time for Dream Fes, and DearDream has made the
      daring decision to enter the festival with an original song. They manage to
      find someone to compose it for them, but Shin, who's been tasked with writing
      the lyrics, is drawing a blank. Can DearDear complete their song in time?!
