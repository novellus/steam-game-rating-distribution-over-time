    review: Although I found Nice slice to be a unique take on the tap and slice genre
      of games. I Found it was just to grindy to recommend. The best part about the
      game is the different types of knifes. I also thought the space station level
      was really fun. There is no achievements for unlocking the knifes or the locations.
      You just get 1 million nice slices. I would have had more motivation to play
      if the achievements were more fun. The only way I would recommend this game
      is for the achievements, and that was not great.
