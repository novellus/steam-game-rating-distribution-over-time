    review: Overall, this movie is pretty good. The acting is great, the storyline
      is very real, and it shows how different people react to things differently
      and the vices they use to get through pain. The only problem I had with the
      movie was the story never really had peaks aside from one scene...the movie
      lacked that 'umph' that I was hoping for. In movies like these you would expect
      to get some sort of wisdom. I just didn't get that from this movie.  I wouldn't
      watch it again, but I do think it's worth watching at least once.
