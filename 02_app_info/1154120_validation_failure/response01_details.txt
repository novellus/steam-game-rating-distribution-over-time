Each column is an internal milestone leading up to the Alpha 1 release.  Green tags indicate items we've finished; yellow tags are tasks that are currently in progress.  You can see that we've made quite a lot of progress, and have only a few more milestones to go before alpha testers get to see it!<br><br>-T21<br><br>--To Stay up to date with all our progress, please checkout our Kickstarter's Update page:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/team21studio\/ilysia-experience-the-glory-days-of-mmorpgs-again-in-vr\/posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/team21studio\/ilysia-experience-the-glory-days-of-mmorpgs-again-in-vr\/posts<\/a><br><br>Or join our Discord Channel [Let us know if the link dies, even the ones that say they dont expire only last a little while]: <br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/5GJ94YY4nz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/discord.gg\/5GJ94YY4nz<\/a><\/p><br><h1>Buzz<\/h1><p>ðŸŽ‰ -We are about to launch our Kickstarter Tomorrow (Friday September 4th)! ðŸŽ‰<br><br><br>You can follow the link below to get notified as soon as Kickstarter goes LIVE!!<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/team21studio\/ilysia-experience-the-glory-days-of-mmorpgs-again-in-vr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/team21studio\/ilysia-experience-the-glory-days-of-mmorpgs-again-in-vr<\/a><br><br>ðŸ“½ - We will be hosting a watch party for our new Game Trailer on Youtube and our Discord right before the Launch!<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qs_t6Y7xW_I&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\" >https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qs_t6Y7xW_I&amp;feature=youtu.be<\/a><br><br>If you would like to join our large and growing Discord community to stay up to date with all the day to day updates we are doing you can join us here:<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/27MrzC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/discord.gg\/27MrzC<\/a><br><br>Countdown to Kickstarter has officially started! <br><br>ðŸ’–-And Thank You to Everyone who has help us get to where we are today! -ðŸ’–<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Ilysia, coming soon, is a Room-scale Multiplayer Online VR RPG.
