    review: 'Not a bad first indie game entry by the developer "Storm Signal" but
      lacks far too much and asks way to high of a price.


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZHFnLSWaj8&feature=youtu.be


      How can this developer call this game a "twin stick shooter" when controllers
      aren''t supported at all?  ..You are forced to use a mouse and keyboard to play!  ..This
      is just mind numbing to me.


      Lack of content hurts the value of this game with only two worlds, each with
      4 stages each.  What?!?  $15 USD for 8 levels?  Ugh.


      No upgrades available except for the ability to get better guns (6 total) as
      you progress.  Ugh.


      No power-ups anywhere.  No cash to grab.  No loot to make killing enemies feel
      rewarding.  Ugh, Ugh, and Ugh.


      Cheap deaths where you fall off or get knocked off into the water and then cannot
      get back up and die even though you are using your boost desperately trying
      to get back on land.  Big Ugh!


      ..It''s a respectable first indie title by this developer but needs more content
      added, needs controller support if it''s going to be called a "twin stick shooter",
      and needs to eliminate the cheap deaths where you can''t get back on land.


      Not even close to being worth the hefty $14.99 USD asking price at launch.  My
      score at launch on May 1, 2019 is a dismal 37% (and trust me when I say that
      is a generous score)..  My score is mostly hurt by the absurdly high asking
      price (-40%).


      Not Recommended until the price drops significantly and much more content is
      added.'
