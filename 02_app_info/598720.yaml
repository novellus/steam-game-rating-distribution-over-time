    review: The suspense of trying to figure out how to craft a huge vertical beach
      hut... ok, 7 wooden poles stuck end to end, with a bamboo pedestal on top, with
      your trusty shotgun in hand, watching the sun slowly glow through the sky, awaiting
      the inevitable nightfall, and zombie/creature rampage, is just that... suspense
      (early March, will update review once Survival's in)  But it's suspense, done
      so well. The graphics and ambience are beautiful.  The in-game Radio's are really
      great, with up to date, real world news.  I was lying on my couch, listening
      to waves crashing in a storm, with world politics playing calmly in the background,
      when I realised almost an hour went by with my eyes closed and my headset still
      on.  The atmosphere is amazing already, and I gotta ask, to make it friendly
      to 'all' gamesters, that Survival Mode becomes an 'Option', and not mandatory,
      but personally I can't wait for Survival Mode.
