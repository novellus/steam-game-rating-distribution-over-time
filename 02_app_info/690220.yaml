    review: "Probably the best platformer I've ever played. The ingenuity, the graphics,\
      \ the music, the ambience, it all combines to create a great cinematic experience\
      \ you can't get anywhere else. \n\nIf you haven't played this game before, I\
      \ recommend you purchase it right now."
