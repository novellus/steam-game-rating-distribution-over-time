    about_the_game: <strong>CAN YOU SEE IT? </strong><br>In the first game by The
      Working Parts, a lone frog descends into the depths of a flooded forest, not
      yet knowing the full extent of its tragedy. To survive in a brutal, oxygen-obsessed
      ecosystem, you must help it see the patterns and hidden truths that make up
      the rules of the forest - horrible as they may be.<br><br>They Breathe is a
      critically acclaimed indie gem risen from the depths of Xbox Live Indie Games.
      In thirty short minutes, the game leaves it up to you to figure out every part
      of its increasingly bizarre universe, in order to survive the onslaught of unexpected
      creatures and ultimately comprehend their true nature. No matter how your descent
      to the bottom of the forest takes shape, it is guaranteed to give you the chills
      without a single word of dialog. <br><br>Keep your eyes open, for there is darkness
      beneath the surface. And you're not at the bottom yet.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul
