    review: $0.99 is about what I'd have expected to play for a game like this. Very
      simple, point-and-click adventure. Took me about an hour not following any guides
      (except to grab the last two achievements after finishing the game) and with
      some technical difficulties regarding the chicken. Not much replayability, but
      a couple fun mini-games and some easy-to-follow goals. Navigation of the map
      could be a bit confusing sometimes, but after a bit of shifting around it works
      out. If you're a history nerd and want something easy/quick to get through,
      and/or if you're like me and coping with quarantine with a bit of dark entertainment,
      this is the game for that.
