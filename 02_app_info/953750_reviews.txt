It turns out the sprite in the promo video was actually ripped from chakan (it has been replaced since). There are possibly more graphics borrowed from other places.\n\nThe game didn't start from steam because of a bug. I had to start it from outside steam, and then the menu doesn't appear unless you press \"enter\", then there is no explnation or ways to change the controls.\nOnce you manage to play, the levels are almost empty and the rare enemies have really simplistic patterns. You just walk until you find keys to unlock  new areas.\n\n\nIf you're still tempted to buy, take a look at the game's discussions first.","timestamp_created":1543446004,"timestamp_updated":1543693712,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572617888450622559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqJfUtecCftD6swE="}
