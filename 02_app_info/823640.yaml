    review: "O jogo tem uma boa hist\xF3ria, uma trilha sonora j\xE1 conhecida de\
      \ quem joga a s\xE9rie, a mesma jogabilidade simples e intuitiva dos outros\
      \ jogos e belos e bem elaborados gr\xE1ficos.\n\nAli\xE1s a parte gr\xE1fica\
      \ foi o que mais me surpreendeu. Isso porque ao jogar v\xE1rios jogos da s\xE9\
      rie uma coisa me veio a cabe\xE7a: a empresa teve trabalho uma vez e depois\
      \ deu Ctrl+C e Ctrl+V de um jogo pra outro, apenas com pequenas modifica\xE7\
      \xF5es.\n\nBem diferente desse onde realmente tudo \xE9 diferente. Houve uma\
      \ remodela\xE7\xE3o completa na parte gr\xE1fica desde cen\xE1rios at\xE9 os\
      \ recursos, \xE9 tudo diferente dos outros jogos da s\xE9rie, o que \xE9 bem\
      \ legal.\n\nAl\xE9m dessa reformula\xE7\xE3o achei tamb\xE9m muito legal que\
      \ ao jogar d\xE1 a impress\xE3o de estarmos construindo nossas constru\xE7\xF5\
      es sobre alguns penhascos. \xC9 como se a c\xE2mera estivesse inclinada bem\
      \ diferente dos outros jogos do g\xEAnero onde geralmente a c\xE2mera \xE9 uma\
      \ vis\xE3o do alto.\n\nSobre dificuldade \xE9 a mesma coisa dos outros jogos.\
      \ Resumindo em uma palavra: fac\xEDlimo. Mas uma coisa me chamou a aten\xE7\xE3\
      o nesse: o tutorial. Pois nos outros jogos da s\xE9rie a gente dificilmente\
      \ consegu\xEDamos ter uma liberdade pois sempre temos que seguir os passos ensinados.\
      \ Nesse jogo \xE9 diferente, a gente tem uma breve explica\xE7\xE3o mas come\xE7\
      amos a jogar livremente desde a primeira fase. Gostei muito disso.\n\nAgora\
      \ vem a parte chata. O jogo tem uns bugs aleat\xF3rios. Comigo aconteceu duas\
      \ vezes, uma tive que fechar e abrir novamente e na outra bastou reiniciar a\
      \ fase.\n\n[b]Pontos positivos:[/b]\n\n- Gr\xE1ficos muito bonitos e reformulados\n\
      - Trilha sonora caracter\xEDstica da s\xE9rie\n- Conquistas (muito f\xE1cil\
      \ de platinar)\n\n[b]Pontos negativos:[/b]\n\n- Muito f\xE1cil\n- Bugs aleat\xF3\
      rios\n- Faltou cartas colecion\xE1veis\n\n[h1]Recomendo para quem gosta do estilo\
      \ pois \xE9 um \xF3timo jogo e tamb\xE9m para quem j\xE1 jogou os t\xEDtulos\
      \ anteriores vai sentir uma boa evolu\xE7\xE3o principalmente na parte gr\xE1\
      fica, ou mesmo para quem \xE9 Achievement Hunter pois ele \xE9 fac\xEDlimo.[/h1]"
