    about_the_game: "The ruthless Shivans emerged through subspace near Earth, harboring\
      \ technology light years ahead of anything seen before. They made no attempt\
      \ to communicate. They did not respond to your heralds. They simply attacked\
      \ and destroyed everything in their path.<br />\n<br />\nAs a pilot for the\
      \ Galactic Terran Alliance you are no stranger to war. However when racing through\
      \ space to engage your new enemy for the first time, you sense something different.\
      \ Suddenly darkness blankets your spacecraft. Your stomach sinks as your eyes\
      \ pan across the Shivan flagship's massive body. Then it begins. Swarms of fighters\
      \ pour out of the belly of the flagship and scream towards you. You\u2019re\
      \ about to discover everything you know about space combat, dogfight style -\
      \ just changed."

    review: The game runs impossibly poorly on a newer rig. Every movement I made
