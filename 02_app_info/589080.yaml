    review: "Wow this game was thoroughly disapointing on almost every level.  FIrst\
      \ off, it would be a stretch to call this a puzzle game as its trailer claims,\
      \ there is nothing to puzzle over.  It provides a series of almost identical\
      \ looking rooms where you are tasked with awkwardly throwing hammers at glass\
      \ balls.  The throwing mechanic does not even feel accurate or satisfying. \
      \ \n\nIt makes almost every design mistake that it is possible to make.  Crouching\
      \ can break the game, making you freakishly tall if you die and respawn.  The\
      \ teleport range is uncomfortablt shory and slow.  Infinite hammer spanners\
      \ litter every level instead of letting the player spawn the hammers directly,\
      \ or even giving you a single hammer that returns to your hand.  The game over-tutorializes\
      \ leaving you waiting around listening to incredibly simple mechanics described\
      \ to you as though they were rocket science.  The story is really simple and\
      \ stupid, but characters talk about it CONSTANTLY and repetitively.  DIalogue\
      \ clips take longer to play than it takes to reach the next dialogue trigger,\
      \ leaving the game interrupting itself constantly.  Boss battle (I only played\
      \ one, I couldn't bear to continue) was frustrating instead of interesting or\
      \ even challenging.  Cheesy cutscene PLAYS ON A LOOP that barely starts its\
      \ second loop before dialogue ends and scene transitions.  Voice acting is terrible\
      \ (forgivable) and there is A LOT OF IT (unforgivable).  Game has an inconsistent\
      \ and ugly visual aesthetic.\n\nThe game's most intesting sequences are elevator\
      \ rides, which it seems to put at the end of level strings as though it were\
      \ some kind of reward to the player.  If you have ever played literally any\
      \ other game in VR that included an elevator ride and the ability to throw an\
      \ object with shitty physics, this game has nothing to offer you.  Not even\
      \ worth it on a steep sale."
