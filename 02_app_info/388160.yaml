      /><br>Project Druid is a game from the past. It was made according to the rules
      of lost and forgotten systems and games. A game without the fancy graphics and
      system from todays games. A game you can sit down for and just play and enjoy.
      It can be hard it can be easy , it all depends on yourself.                                                <br><br>A
      labyrinth game based on the concept of the c64 game Druid. Simple graphics and
      simple game play which will keep you busy. A small but entertaining game. Find
      the keys and exit hidden in the labyrinths to proceed and try to stay alive
      while your playing. Old skool graphics and game play.<br><br><img src="https://i286.photobucket.com/albums/ll117/shortcircuit-nitros/wraith%20with%20lightning.png"
      /><br>- Total of six levels of big labyrinths<br>- Bosses<br>- Monsters<br><br>NOTE
      : THIS IS NOT A TRIPLE A GAME - ITS JUST A SIMPLE CASUAL GAME - <br><br>The
      game was build from scratch with Game Maker Sudio over a period of two years.
      Most of the graphics were completly made from scratch and a few are from other
      sources.<br><br>Controls are WASD with mouse.<br><br>You will like or hate this
      game. I rather hope you will like it.<br><br>NOTE : Please comment on the game
      and game play. If you find bugs please report them through our website.'
