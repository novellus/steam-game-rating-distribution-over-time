The developer is friendly, engages with players, listens to suggestions and is really invested in the game, releasing new features and fixing bugs.\n\nThe story is very short, you can complete it in a few hours. However, the sidequests and additional content the game provides will give you hours of enjoyment. Although I have to admit that I felt somewhat disappointed with the story, not because it was bad, but because of how short it was, it left me wanting to know more about the lore and what's going to happen next. On the other hand, that's good on its own way, I'm looking forward to next installment in the series.\n\nConsidering this game was made with RPG Maker, software mainly used for making RPGs, I was very impressed by the level of variety and detail that was put into it. I didn't know it was possible to achieve something like this with RPG Maker. There's a lot of different stuff to do. You can tell a lot of effort was made into implementing all this different gameplay mechanics. \n\nMy only complaint is the relationship development between the main character and his love interest. The romance felt somewhat forced, when the romantic feelings were revealed I was like: \"Wait, what? why?\". Perhaps if the story was longer there would have been more room for developing the romance trough it.","timestamp_created":1558161938,"timestamp_updated":1558161938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Yrs5OoCcbyywQE="}
