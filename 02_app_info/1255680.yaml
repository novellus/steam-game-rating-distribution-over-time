      let's you play through the tutorial and the first floor of the tower as many
      times as you'd like.<br><br>You'll get a taste for the combat/locomotion system,
      first floor enemies/environments, and how the game works more generally.<br><br><img

      at the Combat Robot Academy - a deadly, shape-shifting skyscraper where the
      only rule is that you must reach the top to graduate.<br><br>I made this game
      because I was tired of buying VR games that only lasted like 1 hour. Each run
      requires you to adapt to an ever-growing variety of environments, weapons, rivals

      /><br><br><u><strong>Shooter Meets Deck Builder</strong></u><br><br>Build your
      Arsenal by Collecting Cards - each Weapon Card gives your cannons new Ranged
      Attacks, Melee Attacks, or castable Powers. Each card has different strengths,
      weaknesses, and synergies, so you need to make decisions to build a Library
      of Cards that works well for you, your play style, and your current situation
      within each run.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1255680/extras/Rivals.gif?t=1608703454"
      /><br><br><u><strong>Powerful Rivals</strong></u><br><br>Overcome a powerful
      cast of rivals! Challenging boss fights are core to the game play. The rivals
      you face vary each run, so you'll need to learn and counter many unique bosses
      to uncover the tower's mystery.<h2 class="bb_tag">FAQs</h2><br><u><strong>If
      I have an Oculus headset, do I have to play using SteamVR?</strong></u><br>Nope!
      The game includes a launch option to play using the Oculus SDK which is what
      I would recommend if you have an Oculus headset.<br><br><strong><u>Why is the
      game so hard?</u></strong><br>I want the game to be difficult but fair. Your
      first few runs might be rough, but I hope you'll find that by mastering the
      mechanics your skills can make quite a difference. For new players I'd recommend
      remembering to use your dash, smash attack, and gadgets in addition to your
      cannons.<br><br><strong><u>What do you mean by &quot;roguelite&quot;?</u></strong><br>These
      days Roguelikes and Roguelites are popular genres with enough variation in interpretation
      that this is worth clarifying.<br><br>Hand Cannon Virtuoso is Roguelite in the
      sense that it features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Permadeath:</strong>
      If you die, you will need to start climbing from the bottom of the tower.<br></li><li>
      <strong>Out-Of-Run Progression:</strong> Typically found in Roguelites and not
      Roguelikes. Even though you have to start from the bottom of the tower after
      death, you will still unlock Rewards that persist across climbs such as new
      Weapon Cards you can use during your runs.<br></li><li> <strong>Randomized Content:</strong>
      Each time you climb, the sequence of encounters you need to fight through will
      be randomly generated. You may see the same encounters across various runs,
      but not in the same order. The variety of encounters will continue to grow as
      content is added to the game.</li></ul><br><u><strong>Will this game make me
      motion sick?</strong></u><br>It's a great question and I don't want to lead
      you astray here.<br><br>The game's locomotion system is pretty fast-paced. Motion
      sickness was not a big issue during the beta, but that might be due to a selection
      bias where people who opt into VR betas tend to have particularly sturdy VR
      legs.<br><br>If you have concerns I'd say the best option is to try the demo
      and see if it works for you before buying.
