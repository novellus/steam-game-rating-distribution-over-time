I can see how to win and not have much trouble.\n\nBut it doesn't save choices except at the end of fights, and never saves settings.  This means I have to fix the volume EVERY TIME I open it, and if I change my weapon loadout, I need to change it EVERY TIME I go into a battle if I don't win with that loadout.  \n\nI'm all for supporting the little guy, but they need to pay attention to details.","timestamp_created":1594565701,"timestamp_updated":1594565701,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42LXhofMCcq7plAI="}
