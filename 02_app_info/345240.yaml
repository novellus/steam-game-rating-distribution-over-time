    review: "Shogun is the original game that started the Total War series of historical\
      \ military games.  Even after all these years, it is still an amazing game,\
      \ one that has much to offer.  Why is it still an interesting game to play after\
      \ 20 years since its publication will you ask?  Because this game has many qualities\
      \ that will make it worth your time.  Here are a few reasons explaining why\
      \ you will enjoy playing it: \n\n- it is simpler to play than the newer titles\
      \ in the Total War series and is a good introduction to the game system;\n-\
      \ simpler means you could run the game on your toaster and still be able to\
      \ play;\n- it works without a hitch in Windows (XP, 7, 8 and 10);\n- graphics\
      \ are surprisingly good for a game of that age, the animations are great, sound\
      \ is also very good;\n- it has these very nice cut scenes that are fun to watch\
      \ whenever some momentous event happens (these nice cutscenes are absent from\
      \ the following titles);\n- victory means some nice ending cinematic cutscene\
      \ instead of a bland victory message;\n- the game is still supported, if you\
      \ have a problem with the game that you are not able to solve, you can still\
      \ contact SEGA for help on their support website and get assistance!\n\nIf you\
      \ prefer a game that will be more sophisticated, later titles in the series\
      \ will easily make you happy.  If you want to play a classic that established\
      \ a milestone in the gaming world, buy Shogun and you won't regret it!  I played\
      \ it in the past and never had any technical problems with the game, but the\
      \ Steam version seems to have a couple of glitches.  The Throne Room has a glitch\
      \ where the counsellor offers you advice, but the voice does not come through.\
      \  The historical campaigns have bugs that may prevent completing some of the\
      \ campaigns.  Luckily, if you go to the discussions on the game forum in Steam,\
      \ you will find some fixes that will solve this last problem."
