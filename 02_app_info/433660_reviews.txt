Man, was I wrong about this game!\n43 minutes in and we are still going strong, the best part is the zombie survival basketball, not laughed so much in a long time.\n\nI really hope this game gets some more work done to it as it looks like it could amount to a real cracker.\nOnly bug we found was once on a game against each other the ball dropped beyond the screen, but you know what, we just went ahead and started another game and we were back to laughing our heads of again.\nGood, old fashioned madness with great graphics, quick and easy to learn gameplay. \n\nI really, really hope this is a big game as it holds a ton of potential. I can't wait for a couple more mates to come round and we can have some 4 player madness trying to score a basket whilst also trying to launch a rocket at each other all the while dodging zombies.\n\nGreat game, keep this going! PLEASE!!!\n\nAll this really needs now is a thumping mad soundtrack and it will literally be total zombie, basketball, rocket madness!
