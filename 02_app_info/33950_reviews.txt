[/h1]\nThis is a Sokoban-style puzzle game, except that it is a side-scroller, but since your main characters are fish in water, you can move freely in all four directions just like in classic Sokoban, with the twist being that (most) blocks sink, and can kill (most) characters if they fall onto them. You also control at least two characters per level, not restricted to the two fish you start off with, as you encounter more playable characters as you progress, and some levels you can control up to four characters! You can move one character at a time, though, swapping between each one whenever you wish. Each character has their own innate abilities!\n\nThe puzzles are all of the highest quality, albeit very challenging, with no two puzzles feeling the same, and there are more than 100 levels (This is from what I heard, as I'm not even close to half way through at the moment; this game is damn hard!). You also get an interesting, if a bit corny story loosely based on the TV show X-Files, with nice humour and decent voice-acting. There are also unlockable bonuses such as jigsaws, videos and bonus levels!\n\nThe game does feel a bit dated, especially graphics-wise, and the music is forgettable, but in terms of quality of puzzles, I would rank this game up there with titles such as Baba is You, Stephen's Sausage Roll and Snakebird. Its core mechanics may be simpler and perhaps less interesting compared to these games (with Baba is You being on a level on its own due to its ingenious concept; I may be biased cuz it's my all-time favourite puzzle game!), the game manages to be as challenging, if not more, despite its relatively simple mechanics. On top of that, the variety of characters (which I love) with different abilities offers something that these other games lack!\n\nThis game is a huge improvement from the first Fish Fillets, with a vastly higher production value, less restrictive rules and way more features. It's a shame it has gotten this little publicity. If they were to make a Fish Fillets 3 with puzzles of equal quality while adding better, modern graphics and more polished presentation, characters and features, I'm sure it would get the attention it deserves among puzzle fans, as long as it gets marketed properly. I, for one, would buy it in a heartbeat, and would even fund its development if I had more money! I love sea creatures!
