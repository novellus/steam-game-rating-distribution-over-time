    review: 'REVIEW ON VALVE INDEX


      Fun, great value VR shooter game that''s charming with similar Unreal assets
      from "Legend of Luca" and "VR dungeon knight" however they are more customized
      to be more unique.  I do like the variety they give you on how to play the game
      with spells, range weapons and melee.  The music is upbeat and fun and doesn''t
      get boring fast.  There are a few other options that are under construction
      since this is an early-access.  The controls for the Valve Index are not perfect
      to match the instructions in game so don''t expect perfect functionality as
      the developer may address them, hopefully soon. I will update my review and
      place a video on my VR channel soon. Happy Gaming.
