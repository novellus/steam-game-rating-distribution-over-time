    about_the_game: Mr. Foster has been a firm favorite with Killing Floor fans for
      years now - but he's been all on his own. So we thought it was about time we
      introduced you all to... Mrs. Foster!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2><img

      /><br>She was a scarily-successful commodities trader when she interviewed Foster
      for a job. He was clearly a no-hoper as a trader - but there was something about
      him. He was so cool, so suave, so... unique. Unique enough to give her a gas
      mask of her very own on their first date. It was almost as if he'd known of
      her certainty that bio-virus-evil would create the flesh-eating-clone-horde
      and ruin her run of multi-million-pound bonuses. They may not be able to work
      together in the City - but they can work together to exterminate zeds!
