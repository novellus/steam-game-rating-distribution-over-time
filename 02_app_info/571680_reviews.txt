How to describe it? Like fallout mixed up with some final fantasy, and with strong emphasis on decisions, inventory managment and \"random play\".\nI first voted for this on Greenlight and was glad that after months and year of waiting it at last here. Don't be fooled by \"comic\" or \"cartoonish\" graphics - game quite serious when it takes word about survival.\nI hope developer will finish this game because it's one of worthy gems that we can find around some \"trashbox\" games. This one is pretty cool and i just want to see what on end of this road map.","timestamp_created":1566854447,"timestamp_updated":1566854447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+a/z5+wCcImP0QE="}
