It's a standard space shooter with lots of action that never lets up. The ship selection is good, it has really cool looking spaceship bosses, the controls are simple, and I am very greatful to the developers for providing the option of an unlimited continue, arcade mode for people like me that are unspeakably terrible at shoot-em-up games. The game is definitely a lot of fun for some arcade action.","timestamp_created":1601858885,"timestamp_updated":1601858885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42NqO+/QCeIH4pQI="}
