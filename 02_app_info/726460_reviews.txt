Minor characters do not get fleshed out enough, killed off comically fast over one bad choice or NOT EVEN MATTER with some choices.\n\nThere isn't even a chapter dedicated to learning how to command a ship and manage your crew or get used to the many minor characters that you need to rely on later. \n\nThe Honourable Rival chapter is especially poor with choices without any suggestion that one choice which logically you would assume would continue a character thread ending your career is a neck snapping rapid game over.","timestamp_created":1607664075,"timestamp_updated":1607664075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j+CPqPYCdrP9uAI="}
