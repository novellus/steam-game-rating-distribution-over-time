      bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>In a far future, Earth was devastated by mutants who\
      \ took control after a worldwide catastrophic event known as \u201Cthe big pulse\u201D\
      , a global scale electromagnetic pulse that put an end to all electronic technology\
      \ on the planet. Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by \u201CThe Boss\u201D\
      \ in a world ruled by \u201Cthe law of the jungle\u201D.<br>However, not everything\
      \ is lost\u2026 two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order\
      \ to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Main Characters</h2><br><strong>Gal:</strong> A girl who\
      \ escaped from traders of humans. She\u2019s an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived\
      \ martial art. While her attacks don\u2019t have a long reach, her speed and\
      \ agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too.\
      \ She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy\
      \ when facing multiple foes.<br><br><strong>Ricardo:</strong> A minotaur human-rights\
      \ activist and a powerful wrestler. He\u2019s not very fast and his technique\
      \ isn\u2019t as good as his comrades\u2019, but he has a pretty long reach,\
      \ and his power and endurance are amazing. He\u2019s capable of destroying any\
      \ enemy in record time!<br><br><strong>F. Norris:</strong> A runaway ninja whose\
      \ past is a mystery. He\u2019s the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known\
      \ as \u201Cthe forbidden technique\u201D. While he might be pretty fragile compared\
      \ to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus\
      \ an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Credits</h2><br>All the game (graphics, design and programing)\
      \ was created by Sebasti\xE1n Garc\xEDa, while the full OST (composed of more\
