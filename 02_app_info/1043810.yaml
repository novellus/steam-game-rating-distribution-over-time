      notes: "The game has a stylised rather than realistic look, but people sure\
        \ do get shot, stabbed, slammed into walls, smashed through windows, turned\
        \ into crabs, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is blood, necromancy, drugs both real and\
        \ magical, and one spell involves something like euthenasia?\r\n\r\nSubstance\
        \ abuse may be a theme but the substance is mana potions - I don't know if\
        \ that makes it better or worse."
