      \ creatures rumored to dwell in the most remote mountains of Vermont. Wilmarth\u2019\

      \ silent movie adaptation of Lovecraft\u2019s The Call of Cthulhu, the HPLHS\

      \ to authentically capture the actual locations depicted in the story. A cast\

      \ period tale to dramatic life. The result is a motion picture (a talkie, no\
      \ less) that expands Lovecraft\u2019s short story into the kind of thrilling\
      \ cinematic experience that Lovecraft himself might have enjoyed in 1931."

    reviews: "\u201CUltimately Branney nails the spirit of Lovecraft. Through voice-over\
      \ narratives and frightened faces, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; conveys\
      \ a sense of human sanity being unraveled by too much forbidden fruit. By film's\
      \ end, Foyer has the Thousand Yard Stare down to a science. His once-doubting\
      \ Wilmarth has picked from the Tree of Knowledge, and become a reluctant believer.\u201D\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Film Threat</a><br><br>\u201CYou are\
      \ about to encounter what very well be the single most successful H.P. Lovecraft\
      \ adaptation ever to lick fear across a screen. Shot with an aesthetic, production\
      \ design and performance style angled to emulate the feel of '30s/'40s Universal\
      \ horror film - without falling into camp - WHISPERER arrives like shadows out\
      \ of time, a discovered relic from another dimension. A genuinely scary film\
      \ and a hellishly great time.\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Bloody Disgusting</a><br><br>\u201CThe\
      \ Whisperer in Darkness is a hell of a fine film, one of the best adaptations\
      \ of a Lovecraft story ever made, and it's far superior to the vast majority\
      \ of bigger-budgeted films that have &quot;H.P. Lovecraft's&quot; before their\
      \ titles. Whisperer is faithful to a fault to the source material. What changes\
      \ it does make a very welcome and actually enhance the story, as opposed to\
      \ just padding things out, like so many other movies based on Lovecraft's short\
      \ stories do. It is an obvious labour of love and, when movie makers care this\
      \ much, it shows in every frame of the film. If you're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft,\
      \ then this is MANDATORY VIEWING. If you've never read anything by HPL and always\
      \ wanted to see what all the hoopla was about, this is a great place to start\
      \ to get a handle on his unique and genre-changing brand of horror.\u201D<br>5/5\

    review: "The Whisperer In Darkness\n\nThis is a full length feature film in the\
      \ greatest traditions of Lovecraftian horror. \nWithin minutes, the filmatography\
      \ does have the viewer sensing that something is not right.\nWithin less than\
      \ fifteen minutes, the unfolding plot has the viewer on the \"ege of their seat\"\
      \ with elevated respirations and pulse. Still not even sure why... \nOf course,\
      \ any true Lovecraft fan must know how it will finish! But why not find out\
      \ for yourself...\n\nFor any H.P. Lovecraft readers and fans, this is a must\
      \ see!"
