It is strictly this, no bells or whistles aside from a couple different variations on the game such as a mode where 1 hit kills you and a mode where you have a set amount of time that can increase based on score.\n\nI like the aesthetic and the sounds. I do enjoy the core gameplay however there are some hindrances.\n\n1. Ammo spawns are annoying and reduce fun from overall experience. An option for unliimited ammo or a different way to reload would be welcome.\n2. Game difficulty ramps up too quickly. \n3. UI is confusing and at times annoying. Choosing power up in that one mode isn't fun. The UI should be out of sight while playing to create a clear game experience. Less distractions the better. \n4. Overall I would enjoy this game if it improved on its deficiencies.\n\nFinally, while there is nothing wrong with using high score as you main goal, it would be nice if there were levels to progress through (could even change color schemes the further you progress) and perhaps some form of reward for progress made outside of steam achievements.\n\nSadly in this form I can only recommend you give it a try and not to buy.","timestamp_created":1542451940,"timestamp_updated":1542452028,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpsTTkOcCcuH3rgE="}
