    review: 'L''appel du vide, literally "the call of the void", is a French phrase
      used to refer to intrusive thoughts, or the urge to engage in destructive behaviors
      during everyday life.


      [1] Examples include thinking about swerving in to the opposite lane while driving,
      or feeling the urge to jump off a cliff edge while standing on it.'
