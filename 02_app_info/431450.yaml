    review: This is a cool concept to the survival sandbox genre, but this game is
      missing a lot. I can only really say I recommend this game if the developers
      continue to work on it, as in its current state it leaves a lot to be desired.
      The building mechanic is unique in its own way, but leaves me wanting more to
      create. There are creatures, but none that really stand out. All I can really
      say about it in its current state is I hope more comes of it, and it can help
      cure an hour or so of boredom.
