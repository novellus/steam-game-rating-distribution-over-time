I really enjoy the absurdity of the premise and the way the author has woven together science fiction, theoretical physics, and whimsy.  Every turn you find yourself weighing the pros and cons of things like orbital hydroponics, philosophical chemical plants, and unobtainium mines. Choose wisely and you set off crazy chain reactions throughout your planetary rail-system. The game play is strategic, yet full of surprises. When you level up you are rewarded with three choices of upgrades, which introduce you to some bizarre technologies, I suspect some work better in combination than others. I'm looking forward to trying different power-ups, I already have a few favorites.","timestamp_created":1591515103,"timestamp_updated":1591515103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53287196159362793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48afsxvICd7rUjAI="}
