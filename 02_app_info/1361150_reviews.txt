I found it decent for the price.\nPart of a set of games, that all follow the same style, with mostly only what characters are available, and the scenery seeming to change (rather like the Street Fighter series)\n\nThe gameplay involves moving from one room to another, with a fight in each room.\nThe mechanics involved in that are explained early on and clearly.\nMost rooms you fight a single enemy, some you fight two.\nMost of the gameplay focuses on learning the attack patterns of each enemy, while focusing more on dodging than attacking, as there is no time limit to any fight I have seen.\nThere are several characters you can choose from, and the only negative I can say for the game is the trial/error in picking your preferred character, as you can only test their abilities after no longer having the ability to swap (most carry one of several weapons, and only the pure-melee character is labelled as such in game)\n3 carry a basic machine gun (including the default) one carries a shotgun, two carry miniguns, two carry sniper rifles, and one carries only a sword.\n\nUpgrading stats happens after each fight, as each boss drops several items that do so, though you get to pick only one each fight. Every several rooms will be a quiet room, with 1-5 upgrade items (that again, you get to pick only one)\nFocus more on Luck (the clover) as it upgrades the strength of the other items (IE at Luck 1, you will mostly only see +1 items, at Luck 10, you will rarely see less than a +3)\n\nAll in all, short and simple, but for the price very well made.","timestamp_created":1609299823,"timestamp_updated":1609299929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+oTw2PYCdLbUvgI="}
