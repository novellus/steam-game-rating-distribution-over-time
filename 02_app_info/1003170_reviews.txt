All four of the tracks you purchase for $1 here just aren't in the game at all. None of them. These are weird MIDI tech loops that just physically aren't in the game.\n\nThe actual game only has one song, the main menu music, that just loops forever and never changes. There are two other music tracks in the game files but they're never used. And they aren't in this soundtrack either.\n\nZero indication of these just being random unrelated bonus tracks. The dev probably used these tracks instead of the ones in the game because they're probably royalty-free songs so he wouldn't have the rights to sell these songs by themselves.\n\nThis seperate \"soundtrack\" is a poor quality quick cash grab that just lies about what it is.","timestamp_created":1546233581,"timestamp_updated":1546233581,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542895019054412842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43IGtgegCcbiCtwE="}
