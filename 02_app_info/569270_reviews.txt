The game was developed by Daily Magic Productions and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"Sullivan River\" is the first episode of \"Sable Maze.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, it comes with extra features that are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visual for the game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced and Hard.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are certain tasks that need to be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive map is not automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel is stationary.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Game Strategy Guide; Soundtracks; Concept Art and Wallpapers. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547387842,"timestamp_updated":1599882400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627770781517028809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkIKbwPQCeeiiuAE="}
