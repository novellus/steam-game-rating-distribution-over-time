And someone enemies get tough to defeat so always keep level up to win.\n\nI mostly defeat some bosses but one got me with one hit KO and got me rage quit. And yes it true but I am still not done with it yet.\nIf you got defeat...well you might be prepared something to happened and it did.\n\nwhen bring back to fireplace, you must recover the one you got defeated then head back to fire camp to recover your mental self.\n\nyou can still attack if you are weak but boss can knock you out quick.\n\nKnow the enemy weakness: some weapon you collected can help you win and also use it to defeat this enemies.\n\nSince I can help someone but might lead to spoiler if someone need help on boss.\n\nthis sound noise is kind of really uncomfortable when I hear it but I am trying to ignore it as best I can.\n\nBug encounter: It said I was defeated but I was still moving killing enemies which that unexplainable. so only way to fix it is find a water or black hole and died then it should fix that problem.","timestamp_created":1605550859,"timestamp_updated":1605550898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtc+S6fUCfZXirgI="}
