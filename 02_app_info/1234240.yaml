      is a survival co-op game. You and up to 3 other players have sought refuge in
      the Town Hall of the city and barricaded yourselves within walls and a gate.
      From here on you're tasked with scavenging for resources, improve your defenses,
      and explore during the day. When night comes, the town hall will need to be
      defended from a wave of enemies and for each night you survive, the attackers
      grow in numbers...<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Rebuild</strong></h2>Arm yourselves
      with makeshift weapons, construct defensive contraptions and device a plan of
      action, watch each other's backs while you do your best to last as long as possible
      during the apocalypse!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Experience</strong></h2>As
      you live and die, your soul will grow in experience, unlocking new crafting
      recipes and experiences in Last Farewell, which will both make your next attempt
      easier... and more dangerous.

    review: 'I like the game. The concept is pretty simple, but with all the extra
      mechanics it is fun to play. For example: you can craft traps to help you survive
      the night. But the game has some small bugs or glitches, like your stick is
      not showing but you can still hit puppets, or that you cannot move an item in
      your invertory and it is just stuck. I''ve played this game for 4 and half an
      hour and it has crashed like 5 times, and that SO annoying, because all your
      progress is GONE. Because it is in early acces you can expect those, but I hope
      that crashing is getting fixed soon. I know the game needs just updates so that
      will probably be fixed in the future. I do recommend this game, but it just
      needs updates and then it''s all good!'
