WHAT ??? and you complete missions you get upgrades to last longer and complete this minigame faster, thats pretty much what the games revolves into, i have no idea what the devs are smoking and why they decided to make the game like this, its just a walking sim with a weird minigame throwed in the mix, nice graphics ? yes but that doesnt excuse the boring, repetitive and unconventional gameplay loop.","timestamp_created":1578095875,"timestamp_updated":1609732178,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576174378395080566","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhfjg5fYCfJPS6QE="}
