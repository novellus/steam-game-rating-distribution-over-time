It say 2 hours of gameplay on the game page but took me almost 3 so i'm gladly surprised for that! The concept is good, but it seems that the sword was not always working as intended. This is a game made with smile game builder, so i can understand. Great game!","timestamp_created":1602450636,"timestamp_updated":1602450636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzofgjPUCfcyppwI="}
