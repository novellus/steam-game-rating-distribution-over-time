Other than that, I really liked the costumes personally. Get it if you want some extra stuff to spice up your gameplay but it does have a few additions that makes a certain minigame very easy and ruins the progression unless you decide to only use them for the extra missions like me. And also buy it on sale if you really want it.","timestamp_created":1609631877,"timestamp_updated":1609631877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Kji4vYCdYvzvwI="}
