      camera perspectives as you explore your emotions, but certain emotions will
      lock your perspective, or flip and tear apart the screen. Because of this, the
      camera perspective, character movement, types of puzzles, and your playstyle
      will change depending on the emotion.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1044410/extras/13.gif?t=1610066431"
