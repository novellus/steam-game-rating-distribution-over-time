    review: "The DLC is overall nice, but compared to the original game feels rushed\
      \ out.\nThe focus is obviously on the Achaemenid empire, and the DLC gives its\
      \ best if played as Persia, even if in my opinion developers went too far with\
      \ predestination: Media, Babylon, Lydia and Egypt are but sacrificial lambs\
      \ and the only real threat  comes from Rome (if want to expand westward and\
      \ leave enough time to them to develop legions) or satrap rebellions.\nHowever\
      \ the way Greek-Persian wars are simulated is very satisfying: a minor nuisance\
      \ on the western border for Persia, a struggle for life for the Greeks. \nDevelopers\
      \ followed strictly Herodotus' strategical considerations and therefore the\
      \ duel is mainly between Athens and Persia (the former's mighty navy and overflowing\
      \ coffers are much more dangerous than Spartan armies which, indeed, do not\
      \ stand a chance against veteran Persian troops).\nAfter Persia, Greek factions\
      \ offer the most fun experience: Athens is incredibly powerful (as in the original\
      \ campaign), but personally found more enjoyable to play as Sparta which, unlike\
      \ what the game suggest, is a pretty weak faction.\nAthens' strong bonuses and\
      \ unique strategic advantages allow for a quick expansion and aggressive gameplay,\
      \ almost as much as Persia; which is good since sooner or later someone will\
      \ come asking earth and water and, before throwing them into a chasm, is wise\
      \ to have a powerful fleet at hand.\n\nWestern factions do not provide a substantially\
      \ different experience from the original campaign: the main obstacle to become\
      \ the main western power are the blood-thirsty Romans but, in order to win the\
      \ game, player's faction has to confront Persia as soon as possible.\nAs for\
      \ the other main factions, beside Egypt which plays almost exactly as the Ptolemaic\
      \ kingodm in the orignal campaign, they are basically bad copies of Persia:\
      \ take down Cyrus and then Babylon, Media or Lydia will build the very same\
      \ empire (of course the sooner Persia is erased from history, the better: which\
      \ lead to a rather simple strategic planning).\nRegional decisions are a very\
      \ nice touch, especially those with tactical implications; by mid-game however\
      \ their usefulness starts to wane.\nThe other innovation are negative/positive\
      \ regional improvement: these are found somewhat randomly and can be dealt with\
      \ through different way: in the early turns their impact may be quite significant.\n\
      \nNow, as for the complains, I have to point out that the map, naming, leaders\
      \ names, regional improvements retained the Roman/Hellenistic theme of the IVth\
      \ centuty campaign, and that I find quite nasty (after Cyrus may have an Antiochos\
      \ ruling over the Achaemenid empire; besides, Persians were not so keen about\
      \ building amphitheathers or gymnasia everywhere...).\nFurthermore, regional\
      \ units are the same as in the original campaign, so, to make but a few example,\
      \ Galatian infantry and Armenian cataphracts can be recruited as soon as Greater\
      \ Armenia and Galatia are established: by the time those units are available\
      \ (very early for the oriental empires) there is basically nothing that can\
      \ stand against them.\nI acknowledge that this is a game and not an universitary\
      \ treatise but the former cripple the pretense of historical plausibility which\
      \ the designers tried to follow for the original campaign, while the latter\
      \ leads to clear exploits with very strong impact on the gameplay (yes, I could\
      \ avoid recruiting the Galatians, but the issue is that there is nothing hardcoded\
      \ against my Persian armies being made around a strong core of murderous, unbeatable\
      \ Celts which, through a time machine, traveled back a couple of centuries to\
      \ stomp merrily the poor Greeks).\n\nSo overall I enjoyed the DLC, and hope\
      \ there will be more in the near future; but hope also for more polished releases\n\
      \n\nA note about playing battles in FOG2: FOG2's DLCs are not required, nor\
      \ seem to have a role if installed.\nThe \"conversion\" of FOGE armies into\
      \ FOG2 ones has some irks, the worst being the fact that Greeks, except Sparta,\
      \ can deploy Macedonian-style phalanxes which can easily tear across Spartan\
      \ hoplites (further weakening an already weak faction) and almost all infantry\
      \ but the Galatians; also, Greek cavalry appears in FOG2 as a quite powerful\
      \ shock unit"
