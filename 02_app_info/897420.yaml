    review: 'Clunky controls, especially the jump mechanic : sometimes you will not
      jump and fall into a trap, sometimes you will jump and get stuck into the edge
      of a platform, and sometimes you will jump then jump again if you did not release
      the jump button quick enough. That itself is already quite frustrating.


      Then, the levels are badly designed. In particular, the traps are set in such
      a way that, for most of them you need to execute an almost perfect jump, which
      is, well ... look above. Plus, given that you cannot see that far away, you
      will most likely fall and die without time to react (small saw trap, enemies
      killing you instantly by touching you, ...).


      Also, the AI of the enemies is really bad, and you cannot avoid the bullets
      that are fired at you. I mean, for some of them, you can try and succeed (but
      not for all of them), and you will need to focus a lot for that.


      In addition, the boss fights have literally zero interest. You can either try
      to fight them in a fair way, and die because you cannot dodge enough bullets
      and survive before killing them, even with the healing boxes. Or you can jump
      on a mid-platform, be safe and shoot them to death from there, which is not
      interesting at all.


      Last but not least, this game has some technical issues. For instance, I had
      another Steam game opened (to drop Steam cards in the meantime), and while The
      Christmas Gifts was in full screen and I was playing it, the other Steam game
      was taking into account all of my inputs ...
