      \ products taking you on virtual tours of the building complexes that made up\
      \ this government retreat located at Tivoli near Rome. Travel back in time to\
      \ the Roman theater at the villa. It stands on private property not accessible\
      \ to the public. Then, turn the clock back 1800 years and see how the theater\
      \ looked in antiquity. Learn about the man who built it, the Emperor Hadrian.\
      \ Find out what went on here, go up in the air to see the theater in its geographical\
      \ context, learn about Roman villas, and get a close look at the spectacular\
      \ sculptural decoration, which has been digitally reconstructed. Learn why there\
      \ was a temple in the theater and hear why we think it was dedicated to Hercules.\
      \ Along the way, get to know the long history of how artists and archaeologists\

    reviews: "\u201CI am a professor of Archaeology at the University of Florence\
      \ specialised in Topography of Ancient Rome. I have followed the development\
      \ of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR\
      \ applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am\
      \ delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines\
      \ archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make\
      \ the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts,\
      \ and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they\
      \ may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this\
      \ goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\"\

      \ Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201C\
      As Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday,\
      \ May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the\
      \ Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of\
      \ all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was\
      \ enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential\
      \ to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public.\
      \ Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around\
      \ the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time\
      \ to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320.\
      \ --Dr. Monica De Simone\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Civic Museum of Rieti (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201C\
      This is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary\
      \ and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn\
      \ VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history,\
      \ Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer\
      \ to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested\
      \ in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"\
