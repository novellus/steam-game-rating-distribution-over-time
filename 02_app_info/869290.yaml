    review: 'As I suffer quite a bit from neck and shoulder pains I would like to
      recommend this game to everyone who suffers from the same. Most VR games have
      the player looking either straight ahead or down, but this game mostly had one
      looking up but also makes the player look all around and this combined with
      the vary varied arm motions that the gameplay encourages, makes this an excellent
      game to help loosen up one''s neck and shoulder muscles.


      Apart from these benefits, the gameplay has a nice progression with some fun
      speed challenges thrown in here and there (optional) and a friendly and easy
      to read visual presentation. In terms of graphics it''s about on-par with mobile
      VR, so don''t expect amazing graphical fidelity, but it really doesn''t matter
      when you''re playing.


      As a slight negative, if you are using the Valve Index controllers, you''ll
      need to either set op your own mappings or use a user submitted one (there''s
      a quite good one already available) as the default mapping plain doesn''t work.'
