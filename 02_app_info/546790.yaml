      entire bonus stages.<br><br><strong>Development:</strong><br><br>Comit is designed
      like early 90's platformers because it was actually created back then on paper.
      The first prototype was created in 2011. The current<br>incarnation started

    review: This is a good old fashioned platformer, which is fun to play even if
      it is a little on the easy side. Nice for just passing some time. Pretty good
      music as well.
