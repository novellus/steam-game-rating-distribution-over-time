    review: 'Pretty decent so far


      + Slinging around is fun

      + Levels are interesting

      + Hard to get hang of in a good way

      + Abilities are all useful

      + More open maps encourage a little creativity


      - Tutorial is a bit wonky, voice gets a little annoying

      - Enemies keep things interesting, but hit detection seems a little weird and
      they fly through walls

      - Location 3 really needs some light sources on enemies, makes it harder to
      play than it should be in my opinion

      - GLS seems like it needs to be refined a little, really hard to grapple onto
      objects sometimes even when in range.


      Other than that, pretty fun.  Definitely would be a good time sink with some
      sort of map creator and some refinements.  I think there should be some sort
      of visual indicator when the GLS can attach to an object on the cursor and maybe
      the cursor itself should be a bit larger.  Also some music would keep levels
      more interesting.  More visual variety in levels would be cool too (Maybe a
      small city to swing around as a throwback to the old Spiderman games or some
      supersized jungle).  And a level to dick around in would really be great so
      players could get good without resetting over and over.


      By the way, thanks for sharing your game awhile ago anon.  I didn''t even realize
      it came out until I checked your YT channel recently.


      EDIT: GLS is actually really fun to dick around with, but I feel that the push
      ability is slightly useless.  It helps when I''m swinging around like crazy,
      but other than that I feel like the maps are designed to favor the pull function.


      The thrust is REALLY fun and useful for dodging enemies and for moving around
      more open levels like Location 3 and 4 and for making tight maneuvers with the
      GLS.  I didn''t realize you could use it with the GLS until I accidentally misclicked
      (Add this bit of info to the tutorial maybe?  I didn''t notice it) and the thing
      turns the GLS into some psuedo catapult.  Really cool stuff.


      I haven''t played Deathmatch yet (no servers), but the map is pretty fun to
      swing around.  I think it would be a little better if it were more open though
      and the pillars were spaced a little farther apart.


      Second EDIT: The shield ability is a lot more useful than I thought.  If you''re
      about to overshoot your targeted area, pop a shield in the direction you''re
      launched in and boom.  No more flying.  Missed a grapple and don''t want to
      reset?  Look down, pop a shield.  You won''t fall for about 2-3 seconds.  Really,
      really cool stuff.'
