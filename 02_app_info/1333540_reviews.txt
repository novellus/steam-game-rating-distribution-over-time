But the true killer of any online shooter is players. Where are they?\n\nWeapons feel effective, variety is lacking, but casual is what they named it. Jump in and fire. If you had a group of friends to play with this could be a really fun game, but with the price tag of $40 US it there should be more to this game.\n\nTLDR: Not worth it right now. For $20 it might be acceptable.","timestamp_created":1598224995,"timestamp_updated":1598224995,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631561458110809326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1600091449,"developer_response":"Thank you for your honest opinion and were currently working on an update but its taking time since everyone is working in remote areas,anyway happy Gaming and thanks for your review.have a nice day "}],"cursor":"AoJ4q8LojvQCfJOvnQI="}
