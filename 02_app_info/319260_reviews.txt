Nothing pulls your senses more than a roller coaster in VR. \nYou can change the angle at which you ride and there are plenty of exciting vertical drops and speed.\nUnfortunately, this 'game', after just one week of VRing has demonstrated to me my susceptibility to cyber sickness. \nI managed, uncomfortably to get half way through the second coaster before I was too ill to continue... ... Damn it, I so wanted to ride a coaster, I looked high and low for a coaster sim and finally found it here, and bliddy eck I can't watch it as the main reality sense for me is nausia and drunkeness ;)\nIn fact, this was so bad for me that I still feel slightly, in the backgroundish of my senses, two days later giddy. So if you're like me then it's dangerous, but if you're okie with it then it's a must.","timestamp_created":1487801009,"timestamp_updated":1487801381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iO73s9oCepXtcg=="}
