I adore indie games. By far my favorite genre. And while I can get into some of the more main stream titles out there, there's nothing quite like playing a game that a small group of people, if not just one person, pours their heart into. \n\nSuper GMA is an 8-bit fighting game with 8 characters to choose from. And that could have been all that was put into it, but it isn't. Each character gets their own unique backstory in the campaign and once you beat it, you get to see the resolve to their story. Everything that you see and hear during the game was done by one person and that is where this game gets it's charm. Great music, with an interesting twist on fighting games where once you hit the enemy, you gain a bit of health back. Nice fair fighting. I have yet to play the local multiplayer but I look forward to doing so.\nThe punching sound effects are also very satisfying.\n\nA recent update went into the game making it a nice and challenging arcade mode. It's legitimately very enjoyable when you get a KO. I plan to beat the mode with every character. A nice touch is the ability to add your name next to your high score at the end.\n\nAll of this being made by one person makes me very excited to see what they come up with for games in the future.","timestamp_created":1534549980,"timestamp_updated":1534648620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494766741991043091","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvvKLqOUCcPrWqAE="}
