    review: I purchased this game because I liked the graphics better than the other
      games in the series and other people were saying that there are no time limits
      for the game plus it is less expensive than the other games. This is the only
      game in the series I plan on buying. It took me a little while to get used to
      playing the game, and I spent the first few hours just learning alchemy recipes,
      gathering materials, leveling up a little bit, making some useful items like
      bombs, making money, and filling requests from the cafe. I purchased several
      RPG games this year, and I like this game more than all of the other RPGs I
      tried to play this year. So far, I have been  able to play this game pretty
      easily without looking at the walkthrus, but had to look online to figure out
      how to make better weapons and armor become available.
