    review: "[b] There wasn't any good reviews for this so here I go: [/b]\n\nBefore\
      \ we begin: [u] NONE OF THESE DLCS HAVE THE CHARGER SRT [/u]\n\n[h1] TERMINAL\
      \ VELOCITY [/h1]\n\nThis pack unlocks the airport so that you now can chase\
      \ the most wanted rival escaping to the airport. It's a real cool place with\
      \ a lot of open areas and objects to jump over. It has different textures and\
      \ the airfield's end is just water, so racers and cops usually fall down. And\
      \ the cars from this DLC have a license plate reading: \"VELOCITY\"\n\n[h1]\
      \ CARS [/h1]\n\nThis pack mostly has normal cars you can see on street in real\
      \ life.\n\n[b] Alfa Romeo Mito QV [/b]\n\nThis car sounds like a hypercar though\
      \ it's really slow, slows down a lot when turning as well. Look hot though.\n\
      \n[b] Audi RS 3 Sportback [/b]\n\nThis thing looks like your standard Hatchback\
      \ ride, and it actually is. Honestly it's fairly slow though you can drift with\
      \ it, has good on and off road traction.\n\n[b] BMW 1 Series M Coupe [/b]\n\n\
      This car looks and sounds beatiful. It's pretty fine too, can drift pretty well\
      \ with track tires.\n\n[b] Ford Fiesta ST [/b]\n\nFar as I remember this was\
      \ the car at the trailer. It's pretty much same with the Audi.\n\n[b] Porsche\
      \ 918 Spyder [/b]\n\nThis car is slower than the normal 918 in retail. That's\
      \ all there is to it. Oh and it has an ugly vinyl that you can't get rid of.\n\
      \n[h1] MODS [/h1]\n\nThis is the only pack that has car mods.\n\n[b] DRIFT TIRES\
      \ [/b]\n\nThis thing is amazing. It makes your car slide a lot but if you know\
      \ what you are doing that isn't a problem. You can have really long and fun\
      \ drifts with this thing. And it's PRO mod makes the tire emit colorful smoke\
      \ which changes when you go through a body shop.\n\n[b] JUMP NITROUS [/b]\n\n\
      This thing gives you a hilarous speed boost if you use it mid-air. Though it's\
      \ pretty much useless and depletes really fast. So I don't like but if you will\
      \ spend a lot of time mid-air then you can use it.\n\n[b] RAM CHASSIS [/b] \n\
      \nThis thing is avaible in the core game for some reasons that I don't know.\
      \ Though it's really amazing to get rid of that stupid CRASHED screen for head-on\
      \ collisions.\n\n[h1] ULTIMATE SPEED [/h1]\n\nThese cars are really fast weak\
      \ and hard to control. And the cars from this DLC has license plates reading\
      \ \"ULTIMATE\"\n\n[b] Bugatti Veyron Vitesse [/b]\n\nThis car is a bit longer\
      \ than the original one that comes with the game. And it has silver rims and\
      \ a two-tone color scheme. It's pretty decent honestly, and can drift well.\n\
      \n[b] Henessey Venom GT Spyder [/b]\n\nThis is the fastest car in the game.\
      \ Looks pretty slick as well.\n\n[b] Lamborghini Aventador J [/b]\n\nThis car\
      \ is really ugly. It's really fast like anything else in the pack though. It's\
      \ a convertible as well.\n\n [b] Mclaren F1 LM [/b]\n\nMy favorite car after\
      \ Maserati. This thing is really nice. Fast and hard to control, just like everything\
      \ else in this pack!\n\n[b] Pagani Zonda R [/b]\n\nThis thing is beatiful. It\
      \ only has a carbon fiber paintjob with red lines. It can't be changed.\n\n\
      [h1] MOVIE LEGENDS [/h1]\n\nNow, I am not a person that likes movies, so I won't\
      \ talk about what movies these cars are from. These cars' plates read \"MOVILGND\"\
      \n\n[b] Aston Martin DB5 [/b]\n\nThis thing is really old but it's actually\
      \ pretty well. Looks amazing as well. It's just lovely.\n\n[b] Aston Martin\
      \ DBS [/b]\n\nFar as I know this car has a V12 engine. It screams a lot like\
      \ in James Bond. Looks way better than V12 Vantage as well.\n\n[b] Dodge Charger\
      \ R/T [/b]\n\nThe true american classic. My favorite muscle car as well. It\
      \ has a giant air filter in front too. It's pretty fast and handles really good.\
      \ My favorite car from the pack.\n\n[b] Pontiac Firebird T/A [/b]\n\nThis car\
      \ looks nice but it's slow. Just what you expect from an old car. \n\n[b] Shelby\
      \ GT500 [/b]\n\nI thought this was the 2012 model. Still is a true classic and\
      \ it's just fine. Pretty easy to beat as well.\n\n[h1] NEED FOR SPEED HEROES\
      \ [/h1]\n\nAll of the iconic cars from previous games! Plates read \"NFS-HERO\"\
      \n\n[h1] CARS [/h1]\n\n[b] BMW M3 GTR [/b]\n\nWhat else would you get this DLC\
      \ for at the first place? Sounds and looks amazing. Pretty fast too. Best car\
      \ in the game in my opinion.\n\n[b] Lamborghini Diablo SV [/b]\n\nI think this\
      \ is from Hot Pursuit? Still pretty fast for an old car though.\n\n[b] Nissan\
      \ 350Z [/b]\n\nTrust me, Nissans in this game are absolute crap. Except EGOIST.\
      \ They look amazing but hilariously slow without any mods. You can make this\
      \ thing amazing with right mods though.\n\n[b] Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34)  [/b]\n\
      \n\"rule 34 funy ahahhahaha xd\"\nJokes aside, just read 350Z\n\n[b] Porsche\
      \ 911 GT2 [/b]\n\nBest Porsche ever? It's actually fast and is pretty controllable\
      \ as well. You can use this without mods.\n\n[h1] MODS [/h1]\n\nI know I said\
      \ only Terminal Velocity has mods, but that's kinda true. These mods are only\
      \ for these cars and they are just liveries. You can't change colors in this\
      \ cars but liveries instead. Each car has:\n\nURBAN\nSTREET\nRACE\nABSTRACT\n\
      HERO\n\nI won't comment on these, they are pretty subjective.\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION\
      \ [/h1]\n\nDo I recommend it? Heck yes! It's the best DLC I've seen for a long\
      \ time. Even though this game is really old it's still amazing.\n\n[spoiler]\
      \ Thank you for reading to the end. If you are seeing I wish you a happy day.\
      \ Take care of yourself :) [spoiler]"
