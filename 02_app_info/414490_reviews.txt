I can't describe it any other way. Although Steam says I don't have many hours, a lot of the time I have spent is offline at friends' houses as they demand that I bring Crashnauts down, and despite playing it locally with friends maybe every second weekend the game is not stale and is still our current top local mulitplayer game. \n\nAfter introducing the game to friends and explaining the controls, it took about 1 minute for everyone to get into it, and headshots and crashpod kills were everywhere. I can safely say that Crashnauts will be in regular rotation with my friends, second only to Smash Bros. \n\nI want to also praise the developers. I was struggling to get 6 xbox 360 controllers to work due to the limitations of xinput, so I was in touch with the developer via the Crashnauts Discord. Within a week he had provided me with a beta that had the option of direct input which solved all my issues. I had some concern that this game was forgotten by the developers, but they are working feverishly on new contact. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get this game now. It is an an amazing multiplayer game right now and will only be getting better. \n","timestamp_created":1543183465,"timestamp_updated":1543183465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ot+5pucCf7+dswE="}
