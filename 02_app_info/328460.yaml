      the templars, and the red sixers gangs? We'll give you a piece, a rig, and let
      you try and prove yourself. No guarantees, but if you pull this off you might
      have what it takes to be one of us....<br><br><strong>Game Features:</strong><br><br><ul

    reviews: "\u201CAccolade did a great job with the conversion of the two styles.\
      \ It has opened up a whole new field which I'm sure others will attempt to mimic.\
      \ Steady balance of in car and on foot gameplay with explosive graphics. If\
      \ you're an action fan, your money has probably grown dusty, it's time to brush\
      \ it off.\u201D<br />\r\n90 \u2013 Gaming Entertainment Monthly<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n\u201COverall, I find the game quite enjoyable. While I believe it would\
      \ have profited from things like bodywork damage and better strafing, it\u2019\
      s perfectly playable nonetheless, and is definitely worth checking out.\u201D\
