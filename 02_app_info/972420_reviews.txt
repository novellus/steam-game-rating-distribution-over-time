A few of the hidden object games require you to find an object that matches a shown clue... like a flame is the shown clue so you must find a fire extinguisher. Some of the associations are really weird and annoying. All in all though, well worth the money when on sale.","timestamp_created":1586745120,"timestamp_updated":1586745120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0KLYuPECdpWtgAI="}
