    about_the_game: "A Judas Goat is trained to associate with sheep or cattle, leading\
      \ them to a slaughterhouse while its own life is spared. Mike\u2019s (Guy Evans)\
      \ life was shattered to pieces when he was enslaved by a creature of nightmares.\
      \ Now he\u2019s forced to lure people to their deaths to provide sustenance\
      \ for the monster. Trapped in a cycle of abuse and ever-deepening guilt, his\
      \ sanity\u2019s pushed to breaking point when he clashes with Lisa (Susanne\
      \ Wuest). The woman seems to know about his condition and even offers a possible\
      \ way out \u2013 at a price. But can she be trusted at all? Can anyone? Judas\
      \ Goat is a multi award-winning story of emotional dependence and violent desperation.\
      \ It delves into the murky recesses of modern horror - a world of monsters through\
      \ the eyes of their servants."

      \ story is pretty good too and manages to captures the feel of the world of\
      \ darkness. \n\n10/10 would watch more."
