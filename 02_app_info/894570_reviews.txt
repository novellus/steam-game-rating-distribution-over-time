A superb modification of the Supaplex puzzle game albeit very difficult, sometimes almost diabolically so. I recommend playing the classic Supaplex first and only then giving this a shot. Supaplex HARD requires the player to use some very obscure, peculiar techniques which I previously used to think were nothing but exploits of the Supaplex gameplay mechanics. However, in this game these my-so-called-exploits are perfectly accepted and in most cases you cannot complete levels without them. The quick save option is a tremendous help and lets you prevent rage episodes after failing a level because you only considered 99 moves ahead and not the fatal 100th. I may be exaggerating a little but it does require quite a bit of thinking ahead. In conclusion, brace yourselves - this grabs you by the balls from the very beginning and does not get easier, but you'll feel like a mastermind when you complete all the levels.","timestamp_created":1609765046,"timestamp_updated":1609765246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525139689445495605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww4rf5vYCfuKwwAI="}
