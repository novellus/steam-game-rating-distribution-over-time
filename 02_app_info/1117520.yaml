    about_the_game: G.A.C.K. started as a competition entry to build a S.E.U.C.K.
      remake, based on the C64 original. Since then, many changes have been added
      so the workflow is easier to understand and more comfortable. With the current
      version G.A.C.K. is a lot more than just a remake. It's a fully featured game
      maker with export options for many target platforms.<br>With this App you can
      create games that can be played by a single person or with two players simultanously
      on devices that allow multiple controls.<br>You should be able to distribute
      your game to many platforms.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>GACK has a
      GUI that is much easier to use with a mouse or touchscreen than with a joystick
      back then. OK, the Amiga version had that, too, but then there was a very hard
      limit on visible sprites. That's gone, too. You can produce the enemy occurrence
      you're used from games like &quot;WarBus&quot; easily on modern hardware.<br>Did
      I mention this baby has pixel perfect collisions for everything?<br>You can
      spawn attack waves at different visible trigger-positions, thus entering one
      wave, make ten enemies fly the same route.<br>The levels can scroll sideways,
      too. They start at the bottom and move upwards, but when you make them wider
      than the screen, the players can move sideways, causing the screen to scroll.<br>Options
      for horizontal scrollers and jump&amp;run games have been added as well.<br>The
      image and animation editors have copy/paste support and some other useful features.<br>Saved
      game files are astonishingly small, too. (At least for this century).<br><br><strong>How
      does it work?</strong><br>Basically you just draw images as &quot;Sprites&quot;,
      that's everything that moves, and &quot;Backgrounds&quot;, that's - yes - what
      not moves.<br>Next, you define how the animations for each player or enemy would
      look like.<br>Then you use the map editor to paint the levels on 2 layers. The
      background is just for show. The foreground can optionally stop the players,
      or kill them.<br>After the scenery is set, you simply add a bunch of baddies,
      save the game and heat the triggers.<br><br><strong>And then?</strong><br>You
      can export your game as a standalone game. We also have experimental export
      to HTML5 and configure an Android-Studio project for you.<br>This way, you can
      share your games with friends or even sell them on an online store. Will we
      see your game on STEAM? How cool would that be.

    review: "To say I didn't spend long using this piece of software is a bit of an\
      \ understatement. Minutes rather than hours. But trust me when I say this was\
      \ more than enough to ask for a refund. I wasn't expect a world beater, but\
      \ this ?!\n\n- You can't go full screen, so you have to create a game within\
      \ a small window.\n- When importing your own sprites, you can't specify your\
      \ own folders, eg. a folder on desktop. \n- Couldn't see a way to import own\
      \ sounds. \n- The menu system is very basic and because you can't expand to\
      \ full screen, is really cramped. \n- Clicked to import a sprite from one of\
      \ the built in demos and it crashed to desktop !\n\nI'm sure there's workarounds,\
      \ eg. put your sprites in the folders it does recognise, but it all felt like\
      \ software written in about 1987. \nToo expensive for what there is, and needs\
      \ some serious updates and fixes for me to come back for another look."
