    review: 'I got this game on Humble Bundle back in the day, I''m disappointed that
      a non DMR copy no longer seems to exist But for some reason this version is...broken?
      I can only get to the first 3 of the 7 pillar things you need to activate to
      stablize the islands. No matter what I try I can''t get the other 4 to spawn
      in the game.


      Waste of money.'
