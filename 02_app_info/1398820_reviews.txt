A retro style with a current social feel! Some things I like about it:\n1. It feel like playing one of my arcade machines\n2. Who doesnt want their garden to thrive?\n3. The game is explained just enough that makes you think about what you need to do in order for your garden to stay healthy\n4. While there are not tons of critters/plants/baddies to understand its great fun learning how they all interact and what they do\nI really do enjoy playing this game and look forward to the next round of mouse clicking madness!
