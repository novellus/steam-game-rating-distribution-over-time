Expect the odd crash and regular framerate hitches. The AI are only just passable, that will only give you a slight challenge once you've learned the tracks and gotten the hang of the basic bike handling. I can only assume Milestone have posters all over their office with \"MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT\" in large black lettering all over their walls because that's what all their games feel like.\n\nAll that said, there is a nice selection of tracks and bikes that are fun to control with a gamepad and a basic career mode that you can play through to unlock all the various Ducati bikes in the game in a short amount of time.\n\nGrab it on sale for a couple of bucks and you won't feel too ripped off.","timestamp_created":1609645025,"timestamp_updated":1609645025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ryU4/YCfpv5vwI="}
