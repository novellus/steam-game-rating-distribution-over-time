      \ mysterious universe of alien architecture populated by humanoid clones and\
      \ cryptic symbols.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare yourself for a slippage of time\
      \ and space into five distinct realms: cross the frontier through Fleshold Crossing;\
      \ take respite in Known Unknown; lose yourself within Scumm Engine; face impending\
      \ danger in the tower of Gog &amp; Magog; and experience the brink of sensory\
      \ overload in the psychedelic Tumblewych. The mysteries of what you ultimately\
      \ seek will be revealed: an understanding that reality is not fixed but rather\
      \ both malleable and multiple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If you enjoy lucid dreaming\
      \ and long for some virtual unreality your cup will truly runneth over.&quot;\
      \ Richard O'Brien (Rocky Horror Show)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA thirty minute VR\
      \ exploration of the arcane world illustrated in the drawings of Jess Johnson,\
