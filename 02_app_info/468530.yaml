    review: 'Pretty good point and click game that takes anywhere between 30-60 minutes
      to beat (maybe more if you backtrack to get 100% achievements). It''s atmospheric,
      has some fun twists & turns, and and it''s free! It''s best to go into this
      one without knowing any more.


      ALSO: the collector''s edition is worth the cost!'
