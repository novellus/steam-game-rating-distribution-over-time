Following a series of uprisings, the king was slain by his rebelling subjects, and the magnificent kingdom that once stood proudly among its contemporaries was no more. With nothing left in its coffers and a pitiful four citizens to its name, Avon is now no more than a desolate land infested by wandering thieves and monsters, and effectively dead as a nation.<br><br>Yet even at the darkest hour, there's still hope to be found. Or so it was believed by Princess Ariadne, daughter of the late king. Determined to right her father's wrongs and restore the kingdom to its former glory, Ariadne stands valiantly amidst the ruins, vowing to accomplish her goal by any means necessary. Will her perseverance carry her through? Or is such a foolhardy attempt ultimately doomed to fail...?<br><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features<\/h2><\/strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Kingdom Management<\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More than 20 Unique Characters to Recruit<\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An Engrossing Story With Multiple Endings<\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully Voiced Scenes<\/li><\/ul><\/ul>","short_description":"The once prosperous kingdom of Avon now lies in tatters with nothing left in its coffers and a pitiful four citizens to its name.
