    review: 'This is the new SimGolf, make no mistake. I''m only one hour in and it''s
      [b]flagrantly awesome hole-design bliss[/b].


      The crafting tools are brilliant and intuitive, and worth the entry price alone.


      Some other reviewers have pointed out that the future elements, while they do
      add flavor (and creative depth), they''re a bit heavy-handed... Reminds me of
      SNES F-Zero in how it applied arcade/pinball mechanics to racing. Fun, absolutely,
      but also loses the tradition of classic racing (or golf, in this case). I''d
      be extremely willing to pay extra for a "classic mode" DLC or good user mod.


      Workshop support was what sold me. This is very good...'
