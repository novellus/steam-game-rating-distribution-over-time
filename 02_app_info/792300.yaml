    review: "Korku filmleri seven bir oyuncuysan\u0131z bu oyunu rahatl\u0131kla \xF6\
      neririm, hikayesi ak\u0131p gidiyor. Ba\u015Ftan sona gerilim i\xE7inde oynuyorsunuz\
      \ ve tansiyonu hemen hemen hi\xE7 d\xFC\u015Fm\xFCyor. Her an sizi oyuna motive\
      \ edecek t\xFCrden bir geli\u015Fme ile kar\u015F\u0131la\u015F\u0131yorsunuz.\
      \  Her ne kadar bir korku oyunu olsa da, ayn\u0131 zamanda i\xE7inde bar\u0131\
      nd\u0131rd\u0131\u011F\u0131 bulmacalarda bir o kadar zevkli. Sizi d\xFC\u015F\
      \xFCnmeye itiyor.  Bulmacalar ne o kadar kolay ne o kadar zor her biri orta\
      \ \u015Feker g\xFCzel tasarlanm\u0131\u015F. Hikaye ilerledik\xE7e jumpscare\
      \ sahnelerinden birazda olsa g\u0131na gelse de genel itibariyle umdu\u011F\
      unuzu bulaca\u011F\u0131n\u0131za eminim.  S\xFCresi belki biraz daha az olsa\
      \ daha g\xFCzel bir \u015Fey ortaya \xE7\u0131kabilirmi\u015F ama hikayenin\
      \ devaml\u0131l\u0131\u011F\u0131 ve 2 farkl\u0131 karakteri y\xF6nlendirdi\u011F\
      imiz i\xE7in uzamas\u0131 gayet normal. iki hikaye de sonlanmadan oyunu bitirecek\
      \ halleri yok, sonu\xE7ta.  Hikayeyi daha iyi takip etmek i\xE7in notlar\u0131\
      \ okuman\u0131z\u0131 tavsiye ederim \xE7o\u011Fu zaman as\u0131l hikaye notlar\
      \ \xFCzerinden ilerliyor.  Yoksa tam manas\u0131yla hikayeyi takip etmek biraz\
      \ g\xFC\xE7.  Korku oyunu oynamay\u0131 seviyor ve ger\xE7ekten korkmak istiyorsan\u0131\
      z bu oyunu al\u0131n!"
