    review: "Ok, I just beat the game and want to share some of my thoughts.\n\nThis\
      \ game is a short platformer with a huge influence from Metroidvanias. I wouldn't\
      \ call it a Metroidvania per se because even though we have an interconnected\
      \ map and abilities that let you visit new areas, most of the new areas you\
      \ can visit with abilities are optimal, offering stats rather new upgrades or\
      \ bosses. \n\nThis is also the first game created by the dev and feels like\
      \ one of these browser games that I used to play ten years ago. That's not bad\
      \ by any means, but you have to be aware of what you are getting. The three\
      \ areas are distinct between them, but there is not much variety within themselves.\
      \ In the same area, most of the scenarios will look the same, which can make\
      \ it hard for you to recognize places you have been before. You have like like\
      \ 5 different types of enemies, and in latter areas, they are just variations\
      \ of previous ones.\n\nYou start the game with a short ranged gun. Notice that\
      \ it's not a pistol, so the shooting does not start right in front of your model,\
      \ but a bit farther from you. You have to play accordingly then. Then you have\
      \ four upgrades to get and this is one of the positive points about this game:\
      \ all of them are well welcomed. We have some acclaimed Metroidvania with lots\
      \ of contents that sometimes feels more like collectibles than upgrades since\
      \ you don't use them much. One example would be the weapons on Axiom Verge.\
      \ If I used 5 different guns in a single playthrough that would be more than\
      \ I expected. Here, all of the upgrades are useful for the game. You have [spoiler]\
      \ a double jump, good for platforming, a cannon, which opens some doors and\
      \ are stronger in combat, a \"scatter shot\" which makes combat easier and a\
      \ fireproof vest, useful in most parts of the games where there is lava.[/spoiler].\n\
      Another nice thing you start with is the speed on the character. Platforming\
      \ feels smooth from the start, you don't feel sluggish. I found it surprisingly\
      \ nice. \n\nThe boss fights were interesting and I'll talk a bit about each\
      \ one:\n[spoiler]\nCrab: The first and the most difficult for me. You have to\
      \ hit the inside part of its hands before the head since he covers his face\
      \ with them. The problem is the short range of your gun. I recommend exploring\
      \ a bit and trying to get a long range.\n\nCrocodile: My favorite boss. You\
      \ have a long corridor and he comes from the right. You have to kill him before\
      \ he bites you. It's not hard, rather easy, but I like the idea of an indirect\
      \ \"timer\" on this boss.\n\nShip Boss: Really easy. By this time I have already\
      \ got most health upgrades so I simply facetanked it. You just have to shut\
      \ down its cannons.\n\nKraken: Last boss, not hard. Have to avoid his tentacles\
      \ on the sides of the caves. Dropping on the lava makes it really difficult\
      \ to come back.\n[/spoiler]\n\nNow, I want to pinpoint what I liked (or not)\
      \ on this game:\n\n[h1]Good Things:[/h1]\n\n1 - Has tight controls and platforming.\n\
      \n2 - Does not overcome its stay. It's simple and straightforward and doesn't\
      \ have lots of upgrades, so, if it were longer, would probably become boring.\n\
      \n3 - Interesting boss fights. Besides the third boss [spoiler]which I was able\
      \ to face tank[/spoiler], all of the bosses require some strategy to beat, which\
      \ is a nice feature for such a simple game.\n\n4 - The sound effects are simple\
      \ but honest. I think they fit the game well.\n\n[h1]Neutral Things:[/h1]\n\n\
      1 - The graphics. They are not bad, just plain simple. As I said, if you liked\
      \ to play browser games you'll enjoy the graphics.\n\n2 - The story is quite\
      \ simple/inexistent.\n\n[h1]Bad Things:[/h1]\n\n1 - Short range gun is terrible.\
      \ Lucky you, you can get an upgrade to solve this problem quite quickly.\n\n\
      2 - Falling on lava when you don't have [spoiler]either the double jump or the\
      \ fireproof vest[/spoiler] will take a chunk of your health. \n\n3 - The maps\
      \ don't pinpoint where you are. But the corridors are long enough for you to\
      \ realize your location by yourself.\n\n4 - The corridors are longer than they\
      \ supposed to. There are not variety enough on the enemies or environment to\
      \ justify that.\n\n5 - The game does not give you the option to save whenever\
      \ you want, but only when you die."
