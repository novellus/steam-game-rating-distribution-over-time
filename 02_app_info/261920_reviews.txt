Does a decent measure of power, and you can compare your performance scores to other systems on their leaderboard.\nThe only issue I've had is just visual ones from their website where things are not perfectly aligned. However, I generally put these scores on the HWBot and do my comparisons there. \n\nOther than 3DMark, this is my go to Benchmark and I just love the visuals and the music from this application. Music quality is decent, highs reaches a good range, tweeter separation is clear, bass is slightly flat and lacks low frequencies but does still hit hard on a 12\" sealed box. Good dubstep example.","timestamp_created":1608592840,"timestamp_updated":1608592840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Nrmw/YCec2GvAI="}
