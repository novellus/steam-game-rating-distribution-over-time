It's also the first bullet hell game I've actually had some (if any) hope at beating, others I've played being Issac, and Enter the Gungeon. Both were fun, but not for me. This, this however strikes a vein of players not 'hardcore' enough to enjoy the harder games, but still interested in a bullet hell 'shoot'em up' sort of thing. That's not even mentioning that the game is in early access, and most likely has more wonderful content to come. And yet another plus; it's a small crew, as indicated by the Unity slide saying 'home version'. This means that it isn't a cash grab, and most likely won't go in that direction in the future. Overall, I'd give it a solid 7/10. All I really want at this point is some art of the revolver itself.","timestamp_created":1524973268,"timestamp_updated":1524973734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwh5Hhh+MCdK6gnwE="}
