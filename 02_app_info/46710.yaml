    review: 'Painfully dull, slow and boring game. The worst thing here is that the
      game is very limited. You buy some ships, you make them join the battle (which
      takes place on some sort of empty arena) and... that''s pretty much it. There''s
      no proper campaign, no proper goals and the only things you can control during
      the battle are moving direction, moving speed and guns. In other words, you
      can give your ships an order to shoot, or ignore the enemies completely. And
      that''ll be it. There''s nothing else about the battles in this game. That alone
      is enough to make the game feel bad, but, like I''ve already said, it''s also
      painfully slow and even at maximum speed every action takes forever for your
      ships to finish.


      As the result, this game is literally as fun as watching the paint dry. With
      only three kinds of commands, very slow speed and almost nothing to achieve,
      it''s a royal waste of both your time and money. Even with [b]90%[/b] it''s
      not worth it. Dixi.'
