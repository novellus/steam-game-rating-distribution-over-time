    reviews: "\u201CRainswept is proof that micAmic\u2019s growth continues with great\
      \ promise, their compositions becoming more complex and nuanced when it comes\
      \ to exploring psychologically dense stories.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://acloserlisten.com/2019/05/05/press-a-rainswept/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >A Closer Listen</a><br><br>\u201CTracks\
      \ mirror the heartbreak, loss and sadness of this game\u2019s story. Mostly\
      \ comprising of somber piano arrangements, low synths and soft violins, the\
      \ score fits Rainswept perfectly, giving more life to the game\u2019s voiceless\
      \ narrative.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://indiegamereviewer.com/top-10-indie-game-scores-and-original-soundtracks-of-2019/\"\
