    about_the_game: "The iconic Swiss-made BB\xD6 1100 series electric locomotive,\
      \ nicknamed the Austrian Krokodil or Crocodile due to the long nose either end\
      \ of the centrally-mounted driving cab, makes its way to Train Simulator with\
      \ a heritage spanning more than 90 years.<br><br>Entering service in 1923/24,\
      \ the locomotives were ideally suited to the steep grades of the Arlbergbahn\
      \ and proved themselves regularly in service for the BB\xD6 (the-then \xD6BB).\
      \ The design of the 1100 series was based on the Swiss SBB Ce 6/8 II but with\
      \ some differences to avoid complications, such as the four connecting rods\
      \ to the drive wheels from the motors mounted in each crocodile nose. The first\
      \ seven locomotives, numbered as 1100, were delivered in 1923/24 with the remaining\
      \ nine locomotives, which were stronger and slightly heavier were numbered 1100.1,\
      \ followed in 1925/26.<br><br>Initially all of the locomotives were based in\
      \ Innsbruck but were later moved to Salzburg where they operated over the Arlberg\
      \ and Tauernbahn, displacing the 1670 series as they proved their reliability\
      \ and effectiveness. In 1938, all locomotives were taken over by the German\
      \ Reichsbahn and reclassified as E 89 and E 89.1 until 1953 when they were again\
      \ reclassified under the newly renamed OBB to 1089 and 1189 following refurbishment\
      \ and upgrade work.<br><br>Despite the locomotives only delivering a maximum\
      \ continuous output of 1740kW (2300hp) they are able to propel trains weighing\
      \ several-hundred tons, on top of their 116-ton weight, to their top speed of\
      \ 75km/h (47mph).<br><br>Sadly, only one operating example of the locomotive\
      \ survived into preservation, \xD6BB 1189.02, while three non-operating examples\
      \ were retained. Two were kept as museum exhibits: 1089.06 at the Sinsheim Auto\
      \ &amp; Technik Museum and 1189.05 at the Strasshof Railway Museum. One remains\

    review: 'Amazing value.

      My favourite part of the add-on is the coaches. I would have got them separate
      but I saw this as a good way to get old fashion German coaches with the iconic
      Krokidil in one pack. I would have payed 12 dollars (CAD) for the coaches alone,
      but this brings it to another level. Not my favourite add-on, but it is the
      best value you can get.'
