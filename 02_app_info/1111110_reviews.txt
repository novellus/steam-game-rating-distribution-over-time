The developer certainly put significant time and effort into it. But it is slow and it is boring. In quick play I managed to tank my rating in the first two years, so I was getting no income, and my leaderboard ranking went from 100k to 1.5million or worse. It was actually kind of interesting to work my way back up as I figured out the systems. But the vs battle is slow, coin acquisition is slow. Time advancement is slow and tedious (I would appreciate a hot key to advance a day at a time) unless you fast forward, which allow you to stop until there's an event that forces you to at some unspecified future point, but it doesn't allow you to build up your coin collection before a battle, for example. I like the concept, but it needs a lot of work with playability.","timestamp_created":1594188417,"timestamp_updated":1594188417,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/pjClvMCd4PckwI="}
