Save your money.\n\n[h1]Playing as a cat - 20/20[/h1]\nReally the only thing this game gets right -- you are playing as a lion! You have animal friends!\n\n[h1]Acting like a cat - 0/20[/h1]\nIf the game hadn't told me once or twice that the lead character was a lion, I would have zero idea that he was one.  This is a generic platformer with a questionably-lion-shaped group of blocks as your character sprite.\n\n[h1]Adorableness Level - 0/20[/h1]\nFor a game with a lion protagonist, nothing is cute about it.  The game is made of of squares.  Probably about 50 squares overall.  It's just not much to look at.\n\n[h1]Polish - 2/20[/h1]\nThis game was designed in a way so that nothing is intuitive.  What is a part of the level and what is background is indistinguishable.  The level select screen is a confusing level in itself, without a lot of signposts helping you figure out where to go if you just want to play the game.  They tried to solve all of this by starting you out with 4 (!) tutorial levels, which tell you what the deal is with everything--since every gameplay element looks like a cube, it requires a lot of explanation.  At times, the screen will be overflowing with an unreadable amount of text giving you help, at other times you'll get nothing.  Even the settings screen is a completely non-intuitive blending of gameplay and menu.  \n\n[h1]FUN? - 2/20[/h1]\nI abandoned this game shortly after the tutorial.  Nothing about it draws you in, and it's just a frustrating mess.","timestamp_created":1588951045,"timestamp_updated":1588951045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518348574638366699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uJq3+vECed23hgI="}
