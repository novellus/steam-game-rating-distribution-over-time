To make matters worse, only one has watched the whole season.  Outcast is one of the best shows I've seen in years.\n\nAn amazing cast, great acting, excellent SFX, and a well executed plot all make this worth your time.  The pilot episode is free, so why not check it out?  I did out of curiosity and was hooked.  Now I'm watching for a second time with the GF and still thoroughly entertained.  This is definitely the surprise gem that I'll be recommending to all my movie buff friends.  \n\nOn sale or not, it's worth the money!","timestamp_created":1485426221,"timestamp_updated":1485426221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/KuT7dkCd+nDcA=="}
