As a game though, it is both effortlessly easy and annoyingly tricky.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nDanse Macabre 4: Thin Ice has a strange duality. From a certain aspect, it is easy as the chapters are short and compact, the adventure segments are fair, and the puzzles are varied.\nHowever, the hidden object scenes can be annoying with their similar-looking items, cluttered space, and their tendency to use several lists per screen. They are entertainingly challenging yet drag on uncomfortably long.\n\nAs usual for this series, we come here for the story. We investigate a new art-related murder, namely, the death of several people associated with a famous figure skater. As we progress, the mystery deepens and the body pile increases, giving us a sense of urgency few HOGs can bring.\n\nSure, this is still a HOG and limited by its genre, but as far as casual crimes mysteries go, Thin Ice will be among the more memorable and high-quality ones. It is just the bonus that as an Eipix product, it also has plenty of content to make up for its price tag.","timestamp_created":1556010144,"timestamp_updated":1556010279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566073238849639893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hZTcpOoCfsPmvwE="}
