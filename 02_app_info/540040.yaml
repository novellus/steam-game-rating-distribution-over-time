    review: 'Like the 3rd DLC, Hua Mei and Sylphy acknowledge your existence unlike
      the first two DLC where it looked like Hua Mei was the lead.  That said, in
      this one, your presence has muted Hua Mei''s slightly because it''s less about
      her and more about you professionally fulfilling your mission.  She still has
      her moments to shine, but it''s less blatant than the first two DLC where Hua
      Mei thoughtlessly charges in to each situation and created all sorts of chaos
      that further revealed the character.


      That said, storytelling, this is a step up from the 3rd DLC where it was just
      action-ey.  Here the story is laid out in a proper format so it doesn''t feel
      frantic or stilted.  Plus it does manages to insert an air of mystery like in
      the 1st DLC where not everything is as they appear.  It makes you eager to see
      the next DLC to see if this mystery will be resolved.  The 2nd and 3rd DLC are
      more standalone in this respect when they close their chapter without any loose
      threads.'
