    review: 'Putting aside the fact that the later skills cost millions of ink and
      would take an incredible amount of time to get. I spent 3 hours and only managed
      to finished all the common cards. I stopped playing when common cards were still
      appearing very often costing 500 ink and recycle for 75.


      I attempted to craft 10 cards and only 1 wasn''t a common. That''s 4,325 ink
      after recycling the other 9 commons for 1 random non common card.


      Until the amount of ink obtained is greatly increased I can not recommend this
      game and will no longer play it.'
