This isn't the first time Adventure 2 or Combat 2 have been included in a collection but the fact that they're considered an important enough part of Atari history to keep re-releasing really shows how dedicated Code Mystics and Atari are to actually [i]preserving[/i] these titles and there are definitely some I've never seen before. I haven't played every game but there are certainly some fun ones here, I find myself particularly liking both of the Frog games and Dark Cavern is a lot of fun. They even included some games from the much-maligned Atari 5200 and while the interface for those is a little odd due to how that system's controller worked I'm really glad they're here. I hope that Code Mystics and Atari will continue to put out further packages for Atari Vault. I think it's been the best platform for these games yet and 50 games for 5 bucks is a steal.","timestamp_created":1602003204,"timestamp_updated":1606631168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536817073822021484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgMOrifYCftufpgI="}
