      /><br>A story driven medieval fantasy adventure.  You awake without any idea
      of who you are, where you are or what has happened to you.  Explore this dark,
      cold world as you try to answer the questions you have.   Solve puzzles and
      complete quests for strangers who may be able to help you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Where
      are you?</h2>Find books, manuals and diaries that will give information on this
      strange land.  Using blueprints and raw materials to help you craft useful items
      and weapons will give you progression and using items in a clever way will allow
      you to complete tasks with ease.<h2 class="bb_tag">Who are you?</h2>Other characters
      have their needs too.  Helping them could be the key to your own discovery of
      who you are.<h2 class="bb_tag">What has happened to you?</h2>Solving puzzles
      will allow you to find out much more about how this all happened to you and
      more importantly why....<br><br>A small development team of just two people
      have developed this first episode, and will continue to release further episodes
      that will expand the story with many twists and turns awaiting on your journey.   Discover
      more about the world, your place in it and how you lost your memory.  Each episode
      will have a focus relating to the world, it's characters and the player's place
      in it.  Episode one shows you the world, how crafting items and finding information
      in texts can help you understand it.  Episode two will be directed more towards,
      the characters and the story of your place in Lightmare Castle.<br><br><img

    review: 'Honestly this game has a bit of potential but there are soooooooo many
      things that should have been fixed before you even thought about releasing it.
      I dont want to call the game a scam because it shows that there was some effort
      put into it but 5$ is too much for this game. Its like buying a cup of coffee
      but just getting the cup with no coffee in it and also the cup has a hole in
      the bottom...also the cup is half made...and the other half is made out of shit.


      When firing arrows you dont aim correctly you pull the arrow back to your eye
      which is a really weird perspective and when firing your arrows you can shoot
      your own bow with your arrow


      In the cut scenes the characters move around like they are having a seizure.
      The camera follows them around every where they look and it makes you feel like
      your character is flying around the screen.


      Besides a few villages their are HUGE areas of just empty flat nothingness that
      you have to stare at as youre running around the map


      Your scale compared to building and enemies is tiny! Either every player is
      a midget running around or this world is run by zombies.


      I could go on and on about every issue from glitches to sound, from story to
      graphics, but honestly I would be describing every part of the game which falls
      short in almost every way. Might be better in the future but right now Im not
      holding my breath.
