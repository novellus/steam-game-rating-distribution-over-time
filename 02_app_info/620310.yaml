      Esse jogo t\xE1 injog\xE1vel, muito bugado.\nFiz o tutorial, entrei na primeira\
      \ fase que desbloqueou, passei ela, bugou, todas as outras fases ficaram trancadas.\
      \ Ok.\nFiz outro save, passei o tutorial, tentei outra ordem de fases, e no\
      \ meio dessa de agora n\xE3o carregou uma plataforma. N\xC3O TINHA COMO EU TERMINAR\
      \ A FASE PORQUE A PLATAFORMA SIMPLESMENTE N\xC3O APARECE E N\xC3O TEM COMO PROSSEGUIR\
