To complete the levels (and especially without dying), you need to play in a very slow and calculated way. May be someone who is very skilled can play this at fast pace idk. I don't feel I improved too much after playing for a few hours.\n\nThe view/camera is also too zoomed in - not enough play area in view.\n\nAlso, since the levels do not have a guard-rail, you can fall off easily if not careful (i.e., if you're not slow XD).\n\nWeapon variety is good.\n\nIf you have a coupon, give it a try.. but again it's hard to enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1608548772,"timestamp_updated":1608550160,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513513505458831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6PLDwvYCf7n1uwI="}
