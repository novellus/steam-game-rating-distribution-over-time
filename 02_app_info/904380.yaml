    detailed_description: "<h1>A Word From The Dev</h1><p>&quot;<strong>Vambrace:\
      \ Cold Soul</strong> is a love letter to the games that left their indelible\
      \ marks on us. It's inspired by the gothic fantasy of Castlevania, the deep\
      \ lore of series like The Elder Scrolls, the replayability of roguelites like\
      \ FTL: Faster Than Light, and the sweeping, character-driven epics of our favorite\
      \ JRPGs. It represents our effort to seize those varied elements and condense\

    review: 'If you played darkest dungeon, you will almost certainly be disappointed.  And
      to be fair, a game that ''borrows'' so much of the trappings of DD should really
      have ''borrowed'' the combat mechanics and depth of progression too, seriously.  So
      if that''s what you are looking for, go look at Iratus or something that won''t
      savagely leave you hanging.


      Now, with this out of the way, Vambrace is a ok game.  Severly overpriced at
      $30, but I got it at $10 and I don''t regret it.  The combat is overly simple
      and procedural, and is mostly there to pace the story.  The crafting is also
      super simple, and the rpg/progression is nearly non-existent (companions don''t
      level and each have ONE single item slot, items have, at best 3 tiers of quality).
      The main character skills up a few times during the story, but that''s barebone
      to the point of triviality.


      So why am I even giving this the thumbs up then?  Well, the universe, world
      and story work well and is somewhat original (although you do wonder why they
      lifted their races straight from D&D''s Forgotten Realms, more ''borrowing''...)  The
      ambience is very nice, their art direction is on point (although, it''s pretty
      much DD with a blue/cold tint) and I got immersed. The gentle grind of running
      expeditions and the brief exploration of the classes and items was pleasant
      (if extremely shallow).  Overall, I had a nice time.  Mind you I would have
      been furious at full price, but at $10, there''s enough there.


      So caveat emptor.  Know what you are buying: a short VN (visual novel) like
      game with DD inspired visuals and a patina of DD mechanics that''s only skin
      deep.  If you are ok with this, and get a price you feel is appropriate, there''s
      a universe where this is a decent buy.'
