But here lies the problem, you'll never find anyone online. It's like many other VR titles with mp, it's dead out there. The game will always attempt to look for another player before starting a bot match. Bot matches surfice but they're boring opponents. You can really get some curve on your throws, but the bots chuck in straight lines. They are accurate but not very interesting.\n\nThis title just isn't exciting or deep enough to stand on bot matches alone, but that's who you'll play against.\n\nSo don't bother you'll lose interest quickly. It's a shame, this would be an otherwise fun title rendered pointless.","timestamp_created":1498245055,"timestamp_updated":1498245055,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4oaiX69wCeYLcfA=="}
