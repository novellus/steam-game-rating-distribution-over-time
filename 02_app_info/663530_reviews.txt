That's forgivable in a standard roguelike with a turn-based, grid-based world, but here, it makes simple actions like trying to use items in battle a complete nightmare. Inventory key --> WASD to select item --> use key --> inventory key again. That's not acceptable when doing all that requires standing still while the game continues in real time.\n\nThe basic combat mechanics are also very poorly designed: attacks happen when you /release/ the appropriate key, which makes it feel clunky and unresponsive. The range of the basic attack is also really, really short, with the end result being that combat is no fun at all.\n\nIt also seemed to me like it might have some rather nasty balance issues, but I didn't get far enough for that to become much of a problem.","timestamp_created":1510208670,"timestamp_updated":1510208670,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546167492866516113","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1545667569,"developer_response":"Thanks for taking to time to post your review. I'm sorry that you didn't enjoy the game and hopefully I can provide some info on the controls that can help.\n\nFirst of all, you can reconfigure the keys the way you want and save the settings.\nThere is a graphic in the Artwork section which explains all the keys.\n\nGenerally, it's not a good idea to be rummaging around in your inventory when there's a monster in your face :). There are shortcut keys for selecting and drinking potions, selecting wands and selecting and reading scrolls, that do not need you to go to the inventory. Once you have these setup with your preferred keys, you will find its much easier to fight - and you can go to your inventory in quiet moments when there is no danger.\n\nNote that your speed of attack (delay between swings) depends on a) your strength and b) the weapon. The stronger you get, the better you will be at wielding the heavier weapons. This is deliberate as the game is supposed to be more about brain power than 'speed of click'.\n\nEDIT 24/Dec/18: The melee swing now activates on Key Down instead of Key Up.\nDownload the latest version  (1.7.0) to get this change and other new features.\n\nI hope this helps and entices you to give it another go.\nbest regards."}],"cursor":"AoJwk/Hcz98CceLoigE="}
