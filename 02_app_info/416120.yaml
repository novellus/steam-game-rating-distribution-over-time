    review: "My review after playing it, level 75/100:\nNot recommended: Different\
      \ levels have very different appeals, and you are required to do both kinds\
      \ of levels, whether you like them or not. I'd 100% recommend this game if there\
      \ was a \"skip level\" button.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't like hard execution challenges\
      \ much; I played through Super Meat Boy and Celeste once, and that's enough\
      \ for one lifetime. If you like games like those, then this review probably\
      \ won't apply to you.\n\nThis is a puzzle platformer where you can walk along\
      \ two different tracks, with the goal being to stand under a cube on both tracks\
      \ at once. In the beginning, this is used to move platforms around so you can\
      \ ascend and whatnot. Later levels introduce more blocks, which give you more\
      \ movement options. I gave up on level 75 because I couldn't work it out, but\
      \ I had a lot of fun trying. Ignoring levels 25-30, this game is worth the price.\n\
      \nPros: Decent music (Another review claims that there are only two tracks,\
      \ but there is more music after level 30). Visual design is good; you can tell\
      \ what's going on and it looks nice. The puzzles aren't hard until past 70ish,\
      \ but require thinking in a different way than usual. The first level I particularly\
      \ liked was 10, where I actually had to stop and consider where I needed to\
      \ go to solve it. After level 30, the puzzles become significantly more intricate\
      \ and interesting. I especially like how the later mechanics (purple respawn-point\
      \ blocks, yellow block-moving blocks, and others) mesh with the game's main\
      \ two-track mechanic; it was fun to see how they all interacted. I found myself\
      \ continually surprised and amused at how they all came together to allow progression.\
      \ I loved the twist at 56, although the return of the bounce pads was unwelcome.\
      \ The puzzles are generally satisfying, with significant exceptions.\n\nBig\
      \ cons: Massive difficulty spike around level 27. Unfortunately, this game includes\
      \ levels with two very different kinds of challenges, and you are required to\
      \ do both:\n    thinking challenges, where you have lots of time between steps,\n\
      \    and execution challenges, where you need to do specific steps one after\
      \ the other quickly.\nIt's fine for puzzle games to have a little bit of execution\
      \ challenge in them, e.g. on level 15, which is the first level where you to\
      \ move in midair in both planes at once. Everyone has a different tolerance\
      \ for that stuff. For me, levels 25-30 were a tedious, frustrating slog. I spent\
      \ maybe 8 minutes going through the first 25 levels, and then around 20 minutes\
      \ just on level 27. This is all the more tragic because levels 31 onwards return\
      \ to thinking-challenge only, and were really, really good. If you can bring\
      \ yourself to grind through to level 31, it's worth it. This could be solved\
      \ by a) including a skip level feature, b) unlocking all the levels by default,\
      \ or c) including a bullet time mechanic as Waddlen suggests. Also, some user-avoidable\
      \ bugs forced me to reboot my computer (linux).\n\nLittle cons: The fractal\
      \ or whatever on the bottom of the skybox flickers, which is distracting when\
      \ you're looking from overhead. The platforms have a little bit sticking out\
      \ to makes landing easier, but you have to jump to get on the main platform;\
      \ this is frustrating when red blocks are directly over the platform. You have\
      \ to turn the camera to see where you are in different planes; this makes execution\
      \ challenges where you have to line up with green boost blocks in multiple planes\
      \ much more luck than skill. Some levels have \"cheesy\" solutions, where you\
      \ avoid the intended route. In particular, if you cheesed level 53, I recommend\
      \ going back and doing it the intended way. It's very satisfying.\n\nBugs: I'm\
      \ on Linux; these probably don't apply on Windows etc. Only one big bug, but\
      \ it's a really terrible one: if the game window loses focus while you're in\
      \ a level, it still swallows all of the inputs to your computer, so that keyboard\
      \ becomes unresponsive and mouse only moves the game camera. Losing focus includes\
      \ alt+tabbing to another window or using the volume control. It is not possible\
      \ to return focus to the game e.g. by alt-tabbing back. Computer must be restarted\
      \ to fix. I can avoid doing these things, but still a massive pain. Also, the\
      \ game briefly freezes when you start a level for the first time in a session;\
      \ this is resolved by exiting to menu and loading the level again. Also, the\
      \ mouse curser is supposed to be replaced with a lambda shape/japanese character\
      \ thing, but isn't when you first start the game."
