I am very glad to see someone creating a video game from Vaishnava history - I've been meaning to do the same, myself, for a while, though I always lack the time - in a world where we are being constantly lectured on multiculturalism, all the while ignoring anything Indian that doesn't start 'Mus' and end 'lim'.\n\nUnfortunately, the graphics quality isn't brilliant, and subtitles for cutscenes would be helpful for those players who don't already know the story. However, for such a low purchase price, I suppose I can't complain.\n\nOverall, not a bad game. It may not look perfect, but - as those of us who remember the early-2000s Dawn of War games know - not as bad as it could have been. More importantly, it works, and the story seems pretty accurate. The narration isn't terrible, either, though that may just be because I'm used to hearing Indians speak.\n\nTry it. It's Â£1.69, for a rather fun game based on a story I'm sure many would find interesting; what have you got to lose?","timestamp_created":1565960459,"timestamp_updated":1565960459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47704082727432251","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r4qhzewCdt260AE="}
