    review: "DarK City: Vienna is a detective Hidden Object story that is good to\
      \ play if you're a fan of the HO series. You start by investigating the mystery\
      \ regarding a masked figure (a direct inspiration from the Phantom of the Opera)\
      \ and a mystical disappearing muse in the bonus chapter. \n\nPROS:\n- Male protagonist!\n\
      - Good graphics;\n- Good music;\n- Journal entries;\n- Fast travelling map;\n\
      - Varied hidden object games;\n- Bundle of extras good to try;\n- So many good\
      \ mini-games;\n- Two sets of collectibles that you can spot easily;\n- Feels\
      \ like Charles Dickens' novels mixed with the Phantom of the Opera and any detective\
      \ story.\n\nNEUTRE:\n- It does not give the masked figure's sidekick's point\
      \ of view.\n- The masked figurine isn't a vampire, though he looks like one.\
      \ :)\n\nCONS:\n- The story could be improved;\n- A little bit of mystery and\
      \ imprevisibility wouldn't hurt;\n- Voice acting could be better, but it's good\
      \ as it is;\n- Some subtitles don't appear in the male detective's deductions.\n\
      \nOver all, it has been great fun to play this game. Opera houses, competitivity\
      \ between artists, secrets, love triangles, orphans, opera singers, mystical\
      \ swami, masked entities, you name it. It was fun and informative. \n"
