If you consider goofy looking Xbox 360 Avatars as something scary then I have no idea how low the bar is for \"horror\".\n\nThis game reminds me of Juken Jogoku (also on Steam), and while that is a pretty cheap, cheese horror game, it is far better.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609454660,"timestamp_updated":1609454660,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmqW+3fYCd+CdvwI="}
