      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BOMBASTIC BROADSIDES!</h2>Cannons are the heart of\
      \ combat in Maelstrom. Cannonballs are physics controlled, with a significant\
      \ firing arc and hang time, meaning prediction and good aim are necessary to\
      \ deal damage effectively. On the receiving end, players with good reactions\

      \ Maneuvering to keep your armor between you and your enemy is vital to staying\

    reviews: "\u201CMaelstrom is a unique and original twist on the classic Battle\
      \ Royale formula with naval combat, out-of-match progression, and sea monsters!\u201D\

      Maelstrom\u2019s a nautical battle royale, pitting fantastical ships against\
      \ each other in damp arenas. The ships are fast, the cannons are powerful and\
      \ there\u2019s no risk of being sniped by some invisible bastard. It\u2019s\
      \ lovely\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/05/08/maelstrom-review-early-access/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun - Fraser Brown</a><br><br>\u201C\
      It's a fun and fast-paced game as you swivel around to unleash broadside attacks,\
      \ try to stay out of the line of fire as your cannons are reloaded, grab currents\
      \ to speed yourself up and dart between the islands, and race to collect the\
      \ floating goodies dropped when another ship is taken out.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

    review: "An sich macht es echt Spa\xDF mit hohem Suchtfaktor.\nKein pay2win. \n\
      Man lernt die Mechaniken relativ schnell und kommt anfangs gut vorran. Klar\
      \ sp\xE4ter wirds grindiger.\n\nDie Probleme sind:\n1. Zu wenig aktive Spieler\
      \ dadurch kommt es zu langen Warteschleifen und wenn man dann mal ein Game gefunden\
      \ hat wird relativ viel mit Bots aufgef\xFCllt.\n2. Schlechter Ping. Egal welche\
      \ Leitung. Der Ping ist wenns gut l\xE4uft bei 130ms. Dadurch entstehen ruckler\
      \ oder Standbilder. K\xF6nnen manchmal fatal sein aber meist sind sie nur nervig.\n\
      \nMein Fazit: \nF\xFCr Zwischendrin mit 2 Kumpels machts schon Bock aber auf\
      \ Dauer wirds relativ langweilig. Weil es frustrierend ist jedes Game mindestens\
      \ 2. zu werden. Au\xDFer man inted komplett rein.\nProbiert es aus und macht\
      \ euch euer eigenes Bild vom Spiel.\n\nLG Chris"
