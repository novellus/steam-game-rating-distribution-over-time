You play as a woman trying to save her fiance from a beast, and in the meantime, learn more about the situation you're in and who you are trying to find.  \n\nAs usual, the animation is absolutely beautiful when it comes to the movement animations.  All of the chain animations and short little film aspects are done very, very well for a hidden object game.  They are very smooth.  The storyline also is fairly good.  It definitely is a fantasy setting, and I like how you do eventually find the beast.  I will say that the ending did seem a little underwhelming.  I don't know what ties Isabella to the vampire, nor what the box does.  I can only assume that perhaps she is his lover, or she somehow brings about part two of his plan.  I really don't know, and I wish I did.  Of course, we did go through the main goal of the game, which is to save Isabella's fiance.\nI also would have to say that I like how there's five different settings in the game.  It gives a great place to stop for the moment, and helps progress the game a little further along.  The hidden object games are a little strange in that you only have 4 objects you look for initially, but when you find something, the word is replaced with something else to find.  \n\nOverall, a very good game and I do recommend playing it.  It has a good story and has amazing visuals!","timestamp_created":1607420731,"timestamp_updated":1607420731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ457vvoPYCe/iSuAI="}
