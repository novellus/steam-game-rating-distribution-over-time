The game is hard but it isn't an unfair challenge, none of my deaths have felt cheap. I like the visuals too. It has that creepy vibe to it and there's some nice detail too like the worm wiggling around in the skeleton's eye socket for instance. Another plus is the music. It's pretty dang good and really adds to the atmosphere. Overall I would definitely recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1561605601,"timestamp_updated":1561605601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.649085640907287598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47s68y+sCeK6zxAE="}
