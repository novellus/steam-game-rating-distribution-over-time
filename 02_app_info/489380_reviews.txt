(But with an important, easy bug fix. Read Below!)\n\nVR seems like it was made for archery games. Unlike holding a gun in VR, pulling a bow feels natural and intuitive. QuiVr delivers that gameplay in a simple but engaging loop that has kept me coming back.\n\nQUICK BUG FIX TIP: Right now, QuiVr seems to have a bug that keeps you from collecting equipment. You can fix this issue by running QuiVr Vanguard once. If you do that, QuiVr should work correctly.\n\nQuiVr has come a long way from its simple static, wave-after-wave gameplay (though that experience is still available via QuiVr Vanguard). It's still a wave shooter, but there's a lot more to it. Power-ups, boss critters, enemies that require tactical thinking, and puzzle levels all round out the experience. Do it right and you'll get a piece of equipment that you can use, and you can upgrade and enchant your equipment as well. There are a lot of simple subsystems mixed in - not so much that they're distracting, but enough to give the experience a more polished and immersive feel.\n\nQuiVr shines in multiplayer, where you can team up to cover all your angles and have each others' backs. Puzzle levels scale up to player number as well, so the challenge stays solid.\n\nSummary:\nGraphics: 3/5\nImmersion: 4/5\nFun: 5/5\nComfort: 4/5\nFitness: 3/5\nNumber of charged shots required to take out a teleporting enemy: 1","timestamp_created":1609613311,"timestamp_updated":1609613474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjY+c4vYCc6fovwI="}
