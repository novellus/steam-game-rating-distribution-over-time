    review: In general quite a fun and pretty well made little game. Loved the idea
      and aesthetic. The main let down and the reason why I can't recommend it is
      the save system. Sure it's a roguelike, but having a system where the player
      is not able to save his CURRENT run and come back to it later is just plain
      stupid.
