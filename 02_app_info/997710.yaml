    review: This game reminds me a great deal of Slay the Spire, but with better graphics.  Combat
      takes place by playing cards from your hand.  With Slay the Spire, you are following
      a path to the end scene.  In this game, you are navigating a rectangular grid.  Neither
      game has a lot to offer.
