    review: This was an amazing experience from start to finish. Not only were the
      individual elements of music, art, writing, editing and directing, all individually
      great; the way they all came together really raised it to a new level. Definitely
      up there out of all VNs I've played. It's so cheap too, there's no way anyone
      should miss out on this deal.
