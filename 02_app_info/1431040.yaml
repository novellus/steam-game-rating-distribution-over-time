    review: "Unbelievable fun game! It's football as it was in the old games, and\
      \ pure arcade fun.\n\nHowever, In the short time I played it I already encountered\
      \ a few bugs:\n 1) A goal that wasn't counted (It said goal kick)\n 2) Having\
      \ the wrong coach (Arg vs Ita with boths coaches being the same)\n 3) Losing\
      \ the world cup and the world cup menu being corrupted\n 4) A similar thing\
      \ when winning the world cup\n 5) When purcahsing an item, it doesn't appear\
      \ as purchased unless you exit and re-enter the menu\n 6) Slowdowns when in\
      \ menus\n 7) Even though the power-ups are quite self-explanatory, a proper\
      \ explanation would have been nice. I am unsure exactly how they work.\n\nIt\
      \ is a really fun game so it is a shame that some of these bugs are popping\
      \ up."
