    review: 'A great puzzle game with a nice and interesting story.

      Yes, the game has its flaws as it gets quite repetetive after a while but some
      of the later puzzles are real headscratchers that are very rewarding when you
      solve them.

      the story is quite heavy and well executed even though the game would have profited
      from being a tad shorter as it is.

      It is quite text-heavy as well so you will need to read a lot to make progress.

      Overall this one man project is definetly worth it''s money and deserves more
      attention than it gets. 8/10'
