WHY?\n\n[b]in what ways does blood scrolls surpasses dbz mini warriors?[/b]\n\n- actually tells you how to use beams, grabs, and parries\n\n- superior music\n\n- characters have a lot more health now, meaning matches dont end as quickly\n\nthe game is slower paced but that was probably a design choice. and the A.I is easy even on normal, and only becomes a challenge if you select the hard or above difficulties.\n\n\nif i had bought this while it was still set at over 300 Gs, i would refund the game. but because it costed a mere 40 Gs and i dont see this purchase as a complete waste, i will be keeping this game in my library.\n\nif you like the characters, music, and stages, then this is probably for you. unless you prefer the version of the game that has dragon ball z characters.\n\ndev is working on a sequel to dbz mini warriors on gamejolt called dragon ball super mini warriors. it would be awesome if he were to actually add new gameplay mechanics to the new game. and i hope he makes parries actual parries in his new game. arent parries all about predicting when your opponent will attack, and then timing it juuust right and hit them with a parry? parries should last only for an instant. it would increase the skill ceiling of his next game, which would be a pleasant change.","timestamp_created":1588051186,"timestamp_updated":1598427538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpZTtlPQCcbyAhAI="}
