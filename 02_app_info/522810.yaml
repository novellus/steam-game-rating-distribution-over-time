    short_description: Hidan releases a baffling jutsu, and Asuma bears the brunt
      of the attack. The jutsu is a special trick which links Hidan with Asuma's body.
      In that instant, Shikamaru uses his Shadow Strangle Jutsu to stop Hidan's movements,
      but this jutsu does not last long.
