    about_the_game: Hunt down the killer who murdered the Wolf god! As Wolf's last
      avatar before his assassination, will you revive your god, take revenge on his
      killer, or destroy the pantheon and bring about a new order?<br><br><i>Avatar
      of the Wolf</i> is a 135,000-word interactive fantasy novel by Bendi Barrett.
      It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the
      vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>In a savage land where the
      gods manipulate mortals like pawns on a chess board, Wolf's divine power controlled
      you and protected you. But since Wolf's death, the eyes of Hawk, Spider, Bear,
      Gazelle, and Eel are upon you. The embers of Wolf's power still burn within
      you; your remnants of divinity threaten to topple the pantheon.<br><br>Forsake
      the gods and join the Rising Sun, a heretical sect that defies divine rule.
      Embrace the anarchic, self-serving ethos of Spider and her seductive avatar.
      Obey Wolf's feral impulses and slaughter your enemies as head of the last Wolf
      enclave, or forge a lasting peace without spilling a drop of blood.<br><br>The
      gods are fading. Will you hasten their demise or harness their divine power?
