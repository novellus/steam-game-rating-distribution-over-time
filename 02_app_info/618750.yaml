    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2><br>An unlikely gathering in a dark
      room...<br>Why are three young ladies and a crude mercenary here together?<br>Then
      it appears clear that the place they are in is full of dangers, that some things
      aren't what they seem, and that a superior force is going to play cat and mouse
      with them. <br>You'll have to be mightier than the mighty, grittier than the
      gritty, trickier than the tricky, but in the end, YOU can decide who makes it
      out alive... if any. <br><br>This game is a mystery RPG that will keep you on
      the edge of your seat with its plot and many twists. You can also play it in
      its story mode if you wish not to focus on the battles.<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><br><ul
