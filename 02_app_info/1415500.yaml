    review: 'I didn''t know you could make Sudoku bad? The screen is fuzzy, the colors
      run together making most of the difficulty of the puzzle trying to discern if
      you are looking at a 7, 8 or a 9. You can''t pencil in options, so once you
      have figured out what numbers are there you are just gonna have to remember.


      Also if you click on an empty space it automatically puts a 1 there. Clicking
      brings the number up, Right clicking down. Bonus, sometimes when you click off
      to a different square the old square Also goes up a number. Congrats on teaching
      me that nothing is sacred in this world, and you can in fact screw up something
      as simple as Sudoku.'
