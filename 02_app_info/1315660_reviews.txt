[/h1]\n\nI purchased this game to play with my other friend and loved what it had to offer. The developer has already addressed the issue of having a small player base and that is fine as of now. However, The game is also well optimised for low-end desktops/laptops and I had no issues with connectivity. The game had numerous surprising moments which made me and my friend laugh. In a nutshell, it was thrilling, exhilarating and unique. \n\nThe game had a minor issue too:\n- Camera angles as the player grew in size XD\n\nTo conclude, the game has a lot of potential to grow as a whole. And one must give it a try.","timestamp_created":1606559935,"timestamp_updated":1607785500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607699927,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review!
