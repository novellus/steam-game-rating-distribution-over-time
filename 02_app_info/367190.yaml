    about_the_game: 'Free demo of the CopperCube 5 game engine: Create games without
      programming. Create 3D games, apps and even 3D websites quickly. Includes terrain
      editor, low poly modelling tools, 3D models, precreated game AI, effects and
      more. There are also plenty of features for advanced users, like JavaScript
      scripting and shader support.<br><br>Create your own 3D worlds and 3D models,
      set camera controllers, materials, behaviors, click ''publish'' and your game
      or app is ready. As Windows or Mac OS X apps, WebGL websites, Flash .swfs, or
      Android apps. You can do all this without programming.<h2 class="bb_tag">High
      performance 3D engine</h2>CopperCube includes manually optimized 3D engines
      for all supported targets, running with OpenGL, Direct3D, WebGL and Stage3D.<h2
      class="bb_tag"> Simple-Click game system</h2>No programming needed: Wether you
      want to create a simple 3D game, a complex, epic adventure, or a first person
      shooter: Select from lots of created behaviors and adjust them accordingly.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Terrain Editor</h2>Create your own 3D worlds directly in the
      editor, textures can be painted quickly with automatic texture blending into
      the terrain. There are also tools for placing grass and bushes, and creating
      trees.<h2 class="bb_tag">Physics Engine</h2>Next to the the built-in blazingly
      fast collision and repsonse system, there is also a full physics engine integrated
      when publishing as Windows .exe and Mac OS X .app.<h2 class="bb_tag">Character
      Animation</h2>You can model and animate characters using any 3D software, export
      it into one of the supported file formats and then import them into Coppercube.
      Also, it is possible to download existing 3D models from the web and use them
      in the editor.<h2 class="bb_tag">Low poly editing tools</h2>You can edit your
      own 3D models directly in CopperCube: It includes a simple 3D modelling tool
      for creating levels, models and items.<h2 class="bb_tag">Cross Platform Script
      system</h2>For advanced users, there is a Javascript API working on all publishing
      targets. Additionally, when using Flash, you can use ActionScript 3. And for
      WebGL, there is even a second big JavaScript library with direct access available,
      which is even open source.<h2 class="bb_tag"> High quality Light Mapper</h2>The
      editor includes a high quality light mapping tool. Place your lights, click
      on ''calculate'' and your 3D levels will look great.<h2 class="bb_tag">Native
      WebGL support</h2>Unlike in other 3D engines, CopperCube''s WebGL code is handwritten
      and highly optimized: Your 3D game will download quickly and run fast, even
      if run directly on a website. CopperCube''s WebGL client is just about incredible
      200 KB in size!<h2 class="bb_tag">Many publishing targets</h2> Create 3D games
      for these targets, with one single click: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Windows
      (.exe) apps <br></li><li>Mac OS X (.app) apps <br></li><li>WebGL websites (.html)
      <br></li><li>Android (.apk) apps <br></li><li>Flash websites (.swf) </li></ul><br>With
      the WebGL and Flash targets, your games work basically everywhere, even on iPhone
      and iPad.'
