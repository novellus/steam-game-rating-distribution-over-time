    review: 'In all honesty and good faith I cannot recommend this game, as I didn''t
      enjoy it at all, and I believe that even for a tenth of its price you could
      buy a better game.


      If you want you can watch my first impression and some considerations regarding
      the game and the studio (one man team) in the following video.


      https://youtu.be/66hqI4P99lQ


      I think everyone should also take into consideration the statement released
      by the developer on June 22nd, date that follows the production of my video,
      where I point out things that were then addressed by Cenokga in the following
      statement: https://cenokga.com/my-experience-after-first-game-release-a-letter-from-the-developer/'
