It was fun, addictive, and made me feel smart when I could finish a puzzle quickly. So I expected much the same experience on the pc version, besides the obvious control changes. Unfortunately that wasnt the case. After paying 1.99+tax. I opened it up, and what was I greeted with at the very start? Advertisement, an ad displayed on the bottom half of the screen. Which was not some random misshap. No it was left there on purpose. Probably out of sheer laziness to remove it, and un willingness to.\n\nSo I carried on, and went to the mode select screen. Everything so far in the menus have been for a low resolution screen. Nothing has been updated to work on modern screen resolutions. So that made it harder to navigate around, and find what I wanted. When I played the Puzzle Mode. It had said to swipe to rotate, and to tap to select a cube. So that wasn't changed either. I couldnt zoom out using the mouse scroll wheel to make it easier to see the whole cube from a distance. I felt claustrophobic the whole time I was playing. It was up in my face, and I did not feel it gave me enough distance to play comfortably.\n\nTouch controls are key to scoring high on this game. It is much faster, and feels good. I have to admit. This game was pretty good on mobile, but on PC I just can't recommend this. It feels cheap to me, like it was thrown on steam without much thought put into it. If you absolutely have to have this game then try it on mobile.","timestamp_created":1504288648,"timestamp_updated":1504288822,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.687072038650512695","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr7qmn94CcceehAE="}
