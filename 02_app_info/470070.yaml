    review: "If this were any other franchise I would be willing to just say \"it's\
      \ fine\" and move on, but it's so clear to me that the mistakes of trying to\
      \ milk this franchise into something episodic is the reason The Fall and Mankind\
      \ Divided are currently failures from a plot standpoint, which only continued\
      \ in MD's Season Pass.\n\n[b]Desperate Measures:[/b]\n(Was a preorder bonus,\
      \ it was eventually released for free later.)\nThis is straight up a side-mission\
      \ that shouldn't have been cut out of the main game. For some reason you\u2019\
      re not allowed to use your progress from the main game either, so this is pretty\
      \ much a micro-campaign where you start with 13 upgrade points instead. It\u2019\
      ll also only take you maybe 30 minutes at most. It also contributes next to\
      \ nothing to MD\u2019s story. Basically, I have no idea why this exists. But\
      \ you can play it, I guess? If you needed more evidence that Mankind Divided\
      \ was mistreated, here it is.\n\n[b]System Rift:[/b]\nYou do an infiltration\
      \ mission for Pritchard and it\u2019s very hacker focused. It\u2019s nice to\
      \ see Pritchard return, but it again doesn\u2019t contribute much to MD\u2019\
      s story and it takes place in the same city. Also despite taking place almost\
      \ immediately after MD\u2019s ending, it doesn\u2019t acknowledge your main\
      \ game progress. Which means this is another mini-campaign where you start with\
      \ a clean inventory and skill tree again. Also the story is blatantly supposed\
      \ to get you to play Breach when you finish it. (Don't play Breach.) Overall\
      \ it doesn\u2019t do anything notable for MD and Deus Ex content really should\
      \ be more than just \u201Cyou can play it I guess.\u201D\n\n[b]A Criminal Past:[/b]\n\
      A lot more interesting, but that\u2019s not saying much. Jensen recollects on\
      \ a mission he had to do in a prison, which took place between HR & MD. The\
      \ story actually gives good reason for why you start with no inventory or augments\
      \ unlocked this time, so that\u2019s good. You\u2019ll pretty much be forced\
      \ to use stealth for a good chunk of it but considering the circumstance of\
      \ the mission\u2019s story that\u2019s to be expected. Despite the fact that\
      \ I liked this DLC the most out of the three, it\u2019s a little too short and\
      \ it still doesn\u2019t do much for MD\u2019s story. If they had only focused\
      \ on A Criminal Past for MD\u2019s DLC and expanded upon it though, it probably\
      \ would have been on par of HR\u2019s The Missing Link. (It\u2019s also worth\
      \ noting that the DLC crashed on me near the end, and I had to reduce MD\u2019\
      s access to my processor cores to get around it. Just beware.)\n\n[b]Bonus items:[/b]\n\
      lmao.\n\nOverall the entire pass is a wasted opportunity to add meaningful story\
      \ to MD and is kind of a waste of time. Even if a sequel for MD finally happens,\
      \ I\u2019m doubtful much from this season pass is going to matter. Two of the\
      \ DLCs pointlessly ignoring your main game progress helped absolutely nothing\
      \ too. If you're all in with Deus Ex regardless, then at least get this pass\
      \ on a sale."
