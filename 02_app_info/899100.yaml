    review: 'Edit November 2020:


      I am very dissapointed that the dev did not bother to continue with development
      of this game. I originally praised this game in my gameplay and impressions
      video on Youtube, but after only a couple of updates he vanished. Many promises
      were made, almost none fulfilled so stay well clear and do not give this dev
      your money.


      Older reviews:


      Edit: The game now supports full locomotion, snap turning etc.


      Gameplay based on the latest update 9/8/18:

      https://youtu.be/DDYsKK9knVo


      Sum is like a breathe of fresh air for survival games and in VR we have very
      little choice in them. In playing I found it immersive and fun and while the
      basics for a survival are there such as hunger, hydration, crafting and hunting,
      the game does need work.


      Check out my gameplay video:

      https://youtu.be/wOW66hZ4Aaw


      I found the walking to be different, on the Rift you have to press and hold
      the stick in, then wave your arms in an exagerrated motion to walk. Currently
      there is no snap or smooth turning so you do need a 360 setup up, I have a 3
      sensor Rift set up so it work good for me. It has a learning curve, but after
      my first play I had learned a lot and will be ready to survive much better on
      my next.


      There is cooking in the game, even without the pans it is possible to cook basic
      recipes to help your hunger, just do not eat raw mushrooms as they will harm
      you.


      At this time I don`t think you can build an actual base structure, but the dev
      has said he will be adding building, sickness, weather effects (it rains right
      now but does not effect you yet), more hunting and more!


      If this dev sticks with it and continues development as promised this could
      be a really good survival game, right now it has gotten off to a very good start!'
