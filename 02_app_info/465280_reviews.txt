I bought the game with 90% off - at that price it's worthwhile. I would not pay full price. \n\nI enjoyed the story, and the overall visual and gameplay style reminded me of Monkey Island.  The visuals are nice.\n\nThat said, some things I didn't like were:\n- The debug screen coming up when you hit LT and RT. I don't know how this is still in there when there are years of complaints about it. \n- The game mechanic is a bit awkward at times. Why do I have to look a person up and down and associate an item with that particular spot of them, not just associate it with the person? \n- Who on earth thought the control for the cypher/dials was acceptable. \n- Sometimes the controls were a little janky... I used an Xbox controller, but honestly, I think this type of game is better with a mouse, where you can click anywhere on the screen, not have to navigate to a point for a hotspot to show.","timestamp_created":1609680148,"timestamp_updated":1609680148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4rqa5PYCcMaIwAI="}
