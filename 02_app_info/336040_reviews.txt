This game is brilliant: the single player is enourmous for a free-to-play, with increasing difficulty as you proceed in the campaign, and refreshingly so (finally a game that genuinely challenges the strategist in all of us!) Forget SIM City, forget Magic:the gathering, forget 3D Chess: this game has ALL OF IT, with humour and a fascinating amount of strategies, even more so with the latest v3:reinforcements release. This game is SO BIG that it reminds of the good old days of £30 PC games with full content, a great single player AND brilliantly fun multiplayer (once you get to grips with single player of course!). It was a no-brainer to buy the tripler for £2.99 after the first few rounds as quality and challenge shines through and you know when a top game that only comes around once in a blue moon grabs your attention. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the 'Legendary' or 'Rare' cards - having played this game for more than a year, I can safely say it is all about a good strategy, and with v3 there is even a mode called 'Pauper' where NO legendary and rare cards are even allowed :D. With the plethora of monsters, equipment and spells to pick from, there really is something for everyone and the variety in strategies plus the new daily challenges AND the testing single player campaign (that you can now play 4 times over with the different modes) is simply BRILLIANT - this is THE BEST GAME (I've even sold my now dust-collecting Xbox).
