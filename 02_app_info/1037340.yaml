    review: "Well, first of all, the synopsis is misleading - that description is\
      \ actually about background story that happened the past of actual plot. The\
      \ actual story happens at an institution in spacecraft, not earth and the game\
      \ is not about some kind of a big scale monster war - it is more like a group\
      \ survival from a few of murdering beasts.  \n\nThat said, the game feels a\
      \ little short (approximately 2.5 hr) - at least compared to VNs of similar\
      \ prices.  While translation quality is decent from a view of a native Korean(me),\
      \ I can't really say the amount of plot worth a current price, and the plot\
      \ itself is not that particularly creative, just average one.\n\nAlso, this\
      \ VN lacks several feature like auto mode or skip mode(it can be only manually\
      \ skipped via Ctrl key, and doesn't support window mode very well(The window\
      \ is almost large as full screen mode and its size can not be altered). I think\
      \ these feature can be improved with a proper patch,  but it lacks those feature\
      \ currently.\n\nIn conclusion, this VN feels just average(or slightly below\
      \ average considering lacks of some feature mentioned above) except its short\
      \ length for a price - that is why I give this \"not recommended\" rating. However\
      \ it is also true this game can be finished withing 2 hour(maximum hour available\
      \ for refund)  if you decided to skip all bad endings, so it might be worth\
      \ checking for yourself."
