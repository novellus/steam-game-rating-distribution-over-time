    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Solitaire Club" is a Card game. The game was developed and published by rokaplay.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      This is a solitaire card game, it involves clearing all cards from the screen,
      by using combos and wild cards.


      There are no difficulty game modes to choose from. But all the levels have their
      own difficulty. There is a tutorial for those who are new solitaire or who need
      a refresher course in how to play solitaire.


      There are eighty-four levels spread across seven chapters. The first level is
      automatically unlocked, while the rest are locked; completing the current level
      will unlock the next level.


      All levels have a three star rating system. The stars are earned from playing
      the game. The star rating system represents how many cards are left on the screen.
      There is an opportunity to replay levels for better star rating.


      Gold Coins are earned from playing the solitaire levels. These coins are used
      to purchase various themes. Most of these themes are a bit pricey and it would
      take some level grinding to earn enough coins to purchase them.


      There are eighteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
