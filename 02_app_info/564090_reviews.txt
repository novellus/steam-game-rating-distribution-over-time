There's a map. Thats good. Story is odd. Good but odd. Pretty sure you havn't run across this one before. The added content is also decent. Explains a few things in the main story. Still leaves questions though. Not alot of do I use this with that kind of thing. Also the HOG scenes are pretty good. 1 or 2 things you might need the hint button for because most of said object is obscured behind something else. I'm looking at you rats. Also using hints won't effect anything nor will clicking like a maniac on HOG scenes. There no you clicked to much bs. I reccomend it.","timestamp_created":1537146409,"timestamp_updated":1537146409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569215059280395508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gprE8uUCeYfnqgE="}
