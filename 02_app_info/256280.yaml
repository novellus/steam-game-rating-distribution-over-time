    review: 'Friendship ended with Slenderman

      Doll dummies are now my new best friends


      Crawl through the mansion with latern that actually is much better than flashlight
      while following the obvious linear progression of a map, occasionally encountering
      dummies that can''t move when seen. And occasionally shoot two times at dogs
      with revolver.


      My main experience with this DLC consisted of getting half way through it, then
      BOO, I fell through the floor. Then loaded my latest save and saw that it doesn''t
      reload latest state of the world, with various objects missing, so I couldn''t
      progress.


      Eh, mysterious and spooky.

      aka

      Eh, abandoned and buggy.'
