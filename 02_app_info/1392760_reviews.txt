But honestly there is very little thought put into this. The characters have short stereotypical personalities. The puzzles are all the exact same and even show you how to solve them, they are too simple. \n\nI will admit I like the artwork and the backgrounds are very nice.  Beyond that there is nothing here.  The game isn't even completed. Until this game gets a major update and vast improvements and actually finished. It's not even worth it.","timestamp_created":1608950697,"timestamp_updated":1608950697,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wum7zvYCduKfvQI="}
