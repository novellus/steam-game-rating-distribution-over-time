The creators have mastery of textures and lighting. \n\nHowever, the space designs themselves are mixed, and nearly everything else is lacking. It is a poorly conceptualized story poorly told, with poor writing and poor acting. Despite trying to write a science-fiction story, the writer of the story is obviously not fluent in science fiction, and blunders through many well-trod tropes, giving us nothing new or exciting. \n\nAnd the pacing is terrible. Every time the story is about to build in tension, create some atmosphere, or grab our attention, it manages to break its stride and ruin its momentum. It was so frustrating that every time I thought the game would achieve transcendence, it instead fell flat on its face. \n\nPlaguing the story are far too many references to sci-fi movies the author is obviously a fan of. Those are fine in easter eggs, but in this game they are constantly shoved in your face. \n\nI've more nitpicks, but there's no point in continuing. The upshot is that while I love this genre and had high hopes, this game fails to deliver and I cannot recommend this.","timestamp_created":1609731739,"timestamp_updated":1609731781,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609754099,"developer_response":"Ah man,, I'm so sorry that you didn't like the game. I am and have been during production very critical of my own work. I've been incredibly tense during production regarding the narrative and dialogue because I wanted to avoid following tropes in general. I also wanted to create a more positive narrative and while I'm hinting at a darker tone, which was done on purpose, I really did want to keep things light and have a sad yet feel good ending. It's something really difficult to do, it's much easier to have a bad guy do bad things or drop in evil alien no:26654 I just did not want to go there. Playing with tropes, for sure, but not indulging in them and trying to advert many tropes in the process. I've tried to play around with them and I guess nothing landed for you. What I've learned is how people perceive things so vastly differently so I am always nervous when I get a new review.\n\nFor what its worth I have not been careless when it came to the story. In fact I've had the general foundation of what I wanted it to be including the ending from the get go. In the four years I worked on it, I've gone over it countless times and adding in things to what I perceive to be a more rounded narrative. I have to accept the fact that what I want the story to be is not what people might need or even expect from it and that's just a risk I have to take. I'll agree my writing isn't always the best and I am certainly not trained in it but I wanted to create a narrative that came from the heart and that had something to say in the end.\n\nI really did put a ton of effort into everything, including the pacing and while it starts slow (a bit too slow) I always felt that when chapter 2 starts it picks up and keeps it going steady. What Id like to know is what narrative part(s) fell flat for you. I'm curious to know what you kind of expected versus what you got in the end. Maybe something I can work with / learn from.\n\nThe only thing I will always fight for are the VA's/ They're amazing and I'll take the blame if the dialogue wasn't to your liking, that's on me. I wanted to avoid clean cut deliveries and attempted to have the characters react to things according to their personalities. Even in that aspect I would do things differently.\n\nAnyway, super long reply, I know, again I'm sorry you didn't like it and will continue to take criticism into account for whatever I'll do next. It always hurts when your work just doesn't gel with someone. I experimented a ton in STARDROP regarding almost everything and some payed off some didn't. People either seem to love it or not at all and that's okay. \n\nHope the next game you play is much more to your liking! \nTake care."}],"cursor":"AoJ4mLbf5fYCdImkwAI="}
