I am not putting negative yet because there are some planned updates  which will address my current issues with the game.  In case you're wondering, this is another wave shooter with flying drones and no locomotion.  It stands out because of the amazing graphics.  Also, weirdly, the current environment is very small.  Drones are sometimes just a foot or two away from your face.  Don't buy this game if you have claustrophobia, you do feel like you're in a small room with bots flying almost 360 around you (more like 250).  Although, drones can end up directly behind you.\nThere are currently only two types of drones.  One that shoots at you and one that has a laser coming out of its sides.  After each wave, their numbers increase.  After about wave 9 or 10, they are just everywhere.  You can either dodge attacks or smash them with a hammer if you have a hammer equipped.  You can choose your loadout at the beginning which is just either dual-wielding guns or a gun and a hammer.  As you advance in the game, you can unlock 3 more weapons currently I believe.  However, unlocking those weapons is quite a grind.    (please note: unlike the other reviewer, I had my hammer unlocked right from the start)\n\nI did not see any difference in the waves, just more of the same.  Combat did feel satisfying, mostly because of the graphics and animations, but once it got too crowded, it seemed frame rates took some drops.  There were also slow motions, explosions, and visual animations / sounds that were triggered for reasons I wasn't sure about.  \n\nI don't think this game deserves a positive recommendation yet.  It's currently on sale for $4.49 and I'm giving a neutral recommendation.  I think the fun/content in this game barely meets a 5/10.  Just barely.  Mostly because of the good graphics.  But the gameplay is just too simple.  The only difficulty is in the sheer number of things on screens.  There's so much that dodging bullets becomes more of guessing right on which way to move to avoid them.  \n\nIf the game delivers on their promised updates, then I'll happily recommend.  The promised updates includes more environments and more enemies, etc.  This game badly needs those updates to give you a reason to play more than 30 minutes.  \n\nIf the game does not deliver, then I will gladly change my recommendation to NO.\n\nSale Price Rating 5/10","timestamp_created":1514787313,"timestamp_updated":1514787494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55289149284362793","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwh9uX2OACdOm+lAE="}
