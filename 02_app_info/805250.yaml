    about_the_game: "This demo is designed to give you a taste of what a typical day\
      \ on the job is like. You'll have a chance to go through a single shift on the\
      \ job, working your way through 7 passengers and their accompanying luggage.\
      \ Can you stay focused? Or will you black out on the job? Give it a shot and\
      \ find out if you've got what it takes, your first day is free during recruiting\
      \ season! We'll really take anyone we can get...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo\
      \ stocks you up with a top of the line Bagotron luggage scanner, a full sized\
      \ passenger scanner, a hand held Objectofinder (to help locate contraband on\
      \ passengers), and a reversible double sided switch-face dual usage stamp. You'll\
      \ have less than a minute per passenger to locate and eradicate all contraband\
      \ on their person and in their bags. The timer decreases with each passenger,\
      \ but don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd that's\
      \ it! Get out there and keep the skies safe, agent! And remember, stay frisky."
