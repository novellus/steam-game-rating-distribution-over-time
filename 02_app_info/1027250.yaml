    review: 'Played on Switch for a few hours, liked it. Bought it again, but on Steam.

      It''s a very good JRPG with some unique aspects: the fact that you awaken skills
      in battle at random is cool.

      Some of the achievements (namely, the one that requires you to beat the game
      in under ten hours) required for 100% are a bit crazy, but doable (unlike Octopath
      Travelers achievements..)

      Good OST, better than Dragon Quest XI S but not better than Final Fantasy or
      Octopath Traveler.

      Definitely grab this!'
