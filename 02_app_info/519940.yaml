    review: 'I played this at a trade show and that is what got me into VR.  It is
      a lot of fun.  You won''t be playing this game for 20 hours... but it is a great
      game that has a short learning curve, aka, let your friends play, or if you
      want to play something for just a couple minutes with little time invested.


      As for people saying it is too hard, I actually have the opposite complaint,
      the speed ramp up maxes out after 100 rows or so, and if you can hold that,
      you can just play forever.  I played to 1000 rows just to see if there was a
      "Great Job, you beat the game" or award or something... spoiler alert... as
      of 1100 or so rows, there isn''t.  Once you hit that point, it gets boring.  I
      wish the speed ramp kept going.'
