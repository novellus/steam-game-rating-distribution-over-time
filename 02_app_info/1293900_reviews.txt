Also I believe the maps are randomly generated so thats a plus. I've had no cons with this game so far, so as of right now I recommend you to turn on some jazz and catch some chickens. 10/10","timestamp_created":1606978664,"timestamp_updated":1606978664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5I7Zk/YCe6j3tgI="}
