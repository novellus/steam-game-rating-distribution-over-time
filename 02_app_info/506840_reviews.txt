Random scrolls in pots (you get powerful spell on Level 4, after loading useless text scroll you have found several times already), not being able to buy spells at all, not being able to predict the behaviour of spells when levelling them (for instance trajectory), some spells auto aim nearest enemy which is a pain when trying to kill some other more powerful etc.\n\n2/10","timestamp_created":1541314082,"timestamp_updated":1541427313,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589010417461395264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lseO8uYCctKBrgE="}
