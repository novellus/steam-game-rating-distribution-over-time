    review: 'Great graphics style, from what I could see some great ideas for physic
      puzzles in a 2d platform. The character of the game comes across well, with
      the cute character freeing fellow animals from the evil hunters. Unfortunately
      the jumping in the game is so unresponsive you have to mash the jump button
      in the hope it will jump making the game near impossible to do the simplest
      thing
