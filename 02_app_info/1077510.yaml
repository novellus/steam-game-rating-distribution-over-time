      \ with your own imagination, the game offers a wide variety of gameplay dynamics.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Breaking Box, you control a box with a superpower allowing\
      \ it to grow and then break into multiple smaller parts of itself. Working together\
      \ with various items, it will allow you to explore every inch of this world\
      \ and unearth the secrets beneath.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach NPC in the game has\
      \ been given a special and often hilarious AI to bring more joy along the journey.\
      \ On top of that, there are also boss fights for extra fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nAs Napoleon once said, \u201CEvery action adventure game carries a sandbox\

      \ more fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Test Recruiting:<br />\r\nOur game mechanics\
      \ and level designs are original and bold. So, we want you to join us as early\
      \ as possible to test it out.<br />\r\nJoin our test group, where we will send\
      \ you the latest updates about the game, listen to your feedback and make Breaking\
      \ Box the best we can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Development Progress:<br />\r\
      \nBreaking Box is currently in the stage of mechanics development and level\
      \ designing. Nine levels are already rolled out with around four hours of gameplay.\
      \ In the meanwhile, we are making more content.<br />\r\nWe have designed 60\
      \ unique gameplay elements you can interact with. When putting these many variables\
      \ together with the core box-breaking mechanics, we believe there will be an\
      \ enormous amount of distinctive levels coming out of it. We are planning to\
      \ put out 28 levels before fall 2019.<br />\r\nAt the same time, we are also\
      \ making the online and local multiplayer modes. New levels will be designed\
      \ specifically for these multiplayer modes.<br />\r\nFinally, how is a level-design\
      \ focused game complete without a custom level editor? We answer this question\
      \ by crafting a level editor for you with which you can create a level with\
      \ your own mark."
