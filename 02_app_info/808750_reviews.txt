It won't download, you can only stream it.  I've purchased videos from steam before and had no problem watching them.  I rented this one and it will be the last.  I let it buffer for 5 minutes, then it played and studeered once 25 minutes in, then at 45 minutes into the movie it stopped, won't play.  I tried to skip back and ahead and the movie wont play.  This was on a sony vaio laptop with an i3 CPU hardwired gigabit connection to a 300Mbps internet gateway.  8GB of ram and a solid state drive with windows 10 64-bit with latest update.  Movie was good so far.  Good sound, effects and hot bangkok dancers.  I didn't like nicolas cage in this movie, too depressed looking.","timestamp_created":1528714234,"timestamp_updated":1528714234,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533799529075622559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYGe9+MCcMbZogE="}
