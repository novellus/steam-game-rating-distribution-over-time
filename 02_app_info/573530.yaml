    about_the_game: "The plague destroyed the world you once knew. It destroyed cities,\
      \ towns and countries. When the plague was first identified by doctors, researchers\
      \ started working on a cure immediately. The infected people were transported\
      \ into hospitals to isolate them from other people. But this was not enough\
      \ to stop it. Researchers failed in finding a cure and there was nothing anyone\
      \ could do. Slowly the plague started affecting all countries worldwide, and\
      \ then that's when civilisation collapsed, and that is when the plague infected\
      \ your country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou remember the plague going through your\
      \ body, then the next thing you knew, you awoke in a hospital with doctors doing\
      \ tests on you, they were all wearing masks and protective clothing. You remember\
      \ the screams going through the hospital as the infected patients started becoming\
      \ aggressive. Then you went back to sleep and awoke in the hospital, not alone.\
      \ The plague has also not affected you, you were one of the few that were lucky.\
      \ But now you will have to escape, but can you do it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs\
      \ you progress through the game, you will unfold the story and discover what\
      \ happened to the world. But how far are you willing to go?"
