    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      Currently, this game has 4 positive reviews and 7 negative reviews. I bought\
      \ this game on sale for $2.49 since I figured I might as well take a chance\
      \ for such a low price. I mean I buy 2 chimichangas at the 7-11 for the same\
      \ price and that's as much as a gamble as this.\n\nBoy was I wrong! At least\
      \ the Chimichangas at 7-11 are usually good. This game is just bad, bad, bad.\
      \ I can't find too many nice things to say about it. It's got almost free locomotion!\
      \ That's good. You can't turn, that's bad. The guns are pretty accurate, that's\
      \ also good. The enemy AI is bad. There's more than one gun, I think there's\
      \ 4-5 total. That's good sort of. I think there's only 2 enemy types (and a\
      \ dragon apparently that I have yet to see), that's really bad. There was an\
      \ attempt at a story. There's some nice looking scenes sort of. Everything else\
      \ is not good. This game is a mess.\n\nSo you start out and the tutorial consists\
      \ of some text graphics. Very basic information about what the buttons do. Then\
      \ you're left to your own devices. Well, it took me a while to figure out that\
      \ your'e supposed to go to the trading post and then stand on the light, press\
      \ A (Oculus Rift) and then select the quest and press A again to activate the\
      \ quest. \n\nSo you go to this dark corridor. Your flashlight on your gun barely\
      \ illuminates anything. Your gun overheats quickly. That's okay because the\
      \ zombie AI is dumb and they walk slowly towards you and you can easily just\
      \ backtrack. Just keep shooting, they are quite the bullet sponges. Sometimes\
      \ they drop stuff. You pick it up. You find this object. You click activate\
      \ again, and voila the first quest is done. \n\nWell, that wasn't that bad.\
      \ What are all the negative reviews about? Well, rinse and repeat the above\
      \ about 4 more times before you see a different area. Then guess what? You go\
      \ back to the same area you started in. Just slowly kill stuff. More zombies.\
      \ Walking slowly. Shoot once, shoot twice, three times, maybe on the fourth\
      \ they die. Repeat over and over and over again. \n\nSo this clunky quest system\
      \ repeats itself. There's a store. You can buy and sell stuff. Not sure that\
      \ any of it matters and most things drop anyways. There's upgrades. I never\
      \ figured out how to upgrade my weapons. If anybody knows, please let me know.\
      \ In any event, this game is not worth buying. If it was free, I would give\
      \ a tepid recommendation.\n\nRate 4/10. Recommended for those who love to backtrack\
      \ in games, like clipping issues, and obtuse UI/quest/tutorials. Welcome to\
      \ Groundhog Day in Space VR.\n"
