I have run into very few bugs so far mostly concerned with quests, sometimes they seem uncompletable for some reason, however all that I have had to do was exit completely and reload.\n    Overall very satisfied with how this game runs, the controls, action, visuals, characters the whole deal.","timestamp_created":1609878744,"timestamp_updated":1609878744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvIWQ6vYCc+rnwAI="}
