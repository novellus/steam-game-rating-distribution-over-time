      /><br><br><strong>Ashley: The Emptiness Inside</strong> is a third-person psychological
      horror game in which you explore the restaurant that burned down many years
      ago. This place keeps many dark secrets covered in ash. Learn the history of

      Hidden caches, secret passages and mysterious puzzles are waiting for you on
      the way. Look for information everywhere and you will find answers to your questions.

      dream that turned into a nightmare. You see the walls approaching you, the dusk
      envelops the corners of rooms, and your heart beats more and more. The cozy
      place where you felt happy became quiet and empty. You hear the whistle of the
      cold wind instead of the visitors laughter, you see dim lamps instead of bright
      festive lights, you feel loneliness instead of joy and you smell death instead
      of the fresh dishes aromas.<br><br>Uncover the secrets of a mystical restaurant
      in atmospheric third-person horror game. Unfulfilled dreams and real nightmares
      waiting for you. For many years the grim restaurant has been keeping echoes

      whose bodies become ashes for long ago. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1336970/extras/Header_03_Features_Eng.jpg?t=1597322841"

    review: nice puzzles, not too hard, good story.  I do think this game would benefit
      from voice over the intro and ending, even a cut scene that is drawn out if
      you can't do animation.  Have the radio play more than one song, or at the end
      do credits with that song that can be played on the radio.  overall worth $10.
      I did get this at halloween on sale though. Some issues with being able to see
      through wall but otherwise this is a good puzzle game.
