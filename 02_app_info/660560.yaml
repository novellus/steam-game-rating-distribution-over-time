    review: Fun game(sometimes buggy depending on the current hatch lmao)! IMO i think
      it needs some good game pad control integration to make it easier to just fish
      and have fun as well as making the menu navigation easier also. Just my opinion
      though, regardless one of the better fishing games out there. Keep up the good
      work and updates sir! I would recommend this to novice plunkers and avid fishermen!!!
