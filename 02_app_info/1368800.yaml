      \ tank designed in the early 1940\u2019s. It was based on the Chi-Ha medium\
      \ tank, and differed from it in enhanced secondary weaponry. The tank is armed\
      \ with a 47mm Type 1 cannon with 120 rounds of ammunition, the range of shells\
      \ available consists of high-explosive fragmentation and armor-piercing shells,\
      \ and it is additionally equipped with one 7.7mm hull machine gun and one 7.7mm\
      \ Type 97 AA machine gun. A 212 hp diesel engine can accelerate the tank to\
      \ a maximum speed of 44 km/h.<br><br>Ki-44-I 34 Shoki<br><br>The single-engine\
      \ Ki-44 fighter was developed in the early 1940\u2019s by the design bureau\
      \ of the Japanese Nakajima company. The main requirements for it were a high\
      \ flight speed - at least 600 km / h and a climb rate of 5000m in no more than\
      \ 5 minutes. All available Japanese engines were relatively low-power, so it\
      \ was decided to install the engine of a Ki-49 bomber. To test it, a separate\
      \ fighter squadron was formed (47th Chutai &quot;Kawasemi Buntai&quot; ), which\
      \ took part in the fighting in Malaya in 1942. The main armament of this model\
      \ of the fighter is represented by two 12.7mm Ho-103 machine guns and two 7.7mm\
      \ Type 89 machine guns.<br><br>All premium vehicles allow you to earn increased\

      \ in the game for Golden Eagles) you will earn more Research Points and Silver\
      \ Lions during each battle for a set amount of days. This is cumulative with\
