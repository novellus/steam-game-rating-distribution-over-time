Yes, its old. It came out in 2005. However, it was way ahead of its time. With the graphics maxed out, it actually looks just as good as some of the more popular mmorpgs today. It has pve and pvp. The pvp WAS the funnest part for me, however there are not many players left who do pvp. You guild can buy a guild hall and actually have guild wars taking over other peoples guild halls. Theres different pvp modes as well. You can make a pvp only character that is instantly the highest lvl (level 20). Because of the lack of players, I suggest mostly sticking to pve. There are a lot of players in the big cities, more than you'd expect. Once you leave the city you're in your own instance of the world where you will only interact with npc's, monsters, and players in your party. You can add henchmen to your party to enjoy the benefits of playing in a group without actually having to find people. Unlike GW2, this game is pretty linear and you must stick to paths. Theres no climbing and your character can't jump. You can map travel to different places just by clicking on the map, which really makes things more enjoyable. You can pick a secondary profession to be a mix of two different classes.\n","timestamp_created":1608595827,"timestamp_updated":1608595827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5734596848487854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k43yw/YCeNGHvAI="}
