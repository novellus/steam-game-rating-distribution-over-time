Heragos can use the honing machine to improve his weapon in three different specs: sharpness, weight, and durability. An NPC blacksmith is required to upgrade the weapon to the next level. Players can collect beetles by slicing clot worms, digging up beetle nests, and opening beetle chests, and can use them in the stat menu to dynamically increase\/decrease sub-stats of Heragos.
