    about_the_game: "Over 8,000 years ago, the Khemri played the first ever games\
      \ of Blood Bowl against the Slann. However, as the kingdom died off so too did\
      \ the game, that was until its rediscovery many centuries later. So with the\
      \ game\u2019s revival, it was inevitable that these ancient players would return\
      \ to play again, joined by the legendary Star-Player Setekh.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nBeing dead already has its advantages, not only do they possess the Regeneration\
      \ skill but due to certain arcane devices dragged up from the tombs of the dead,\
      \ some Khemri players also benefit from Block and Pass too. This means that\
      \ the Khemri team surpasses the other Undead teams when playing the ball as\
      \ they can run and pass almost as well as similar players of the living races.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving a few faster players who can pass and run with the\
      \ ball has its advantages but not if their team mates can\u2019t keep up with\
      \ them. With the majority of its team made up of shambling Skeletons and lumbering\
      \ Mummies, the Khemri Coach needs all his centuries of experience not to lose\
      \ his most useful players early on in the game."
