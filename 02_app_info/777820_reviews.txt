But for the sale price of 1.15 euro and the game does having some charm, thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1594054622,"timestamp_updated":1594130542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546347260475158691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw27XllPMCd7qpkwI="}
