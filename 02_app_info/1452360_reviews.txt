Try it if your really looking for a cheap game but I feel that this is asking for to much of the players time with how basic its Mechanics GameplayLoop is.","timestamp_created":1607395765,"timestamp_updated":1607395765,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sJ2QoPYCetOMuAI="}
