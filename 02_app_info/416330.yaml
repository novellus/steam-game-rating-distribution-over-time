    about_the_game: Revolt is a 3D dual stick shooter set in the future, where a devastating
      virus has wiped out most of humanity, and machines have risen up to exterminate
      the remains of the population. You must take control of Guy, a resistance fighter
      who has infiltrated into enemy territory, to battle against the robotic hordes
      and blast through a series of sabotage missions deep in the underground catacombs
      of a robot factory and beyond. Turning the enemy's technology against them,
      you'll wield powerful weapons to fight your way to the heart of the cybernetic
      machine core to discover the source of the deadly virus and uncover who or what
      is behind the plot to wipe out mankind.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><strong>==
