The concept is awesome! But the mech is a bit hard to control and feels a little unnatural during turns, the attacks the player can use feel strangely numb and not as satisfying as they should be. The game doesn't let you upgrade your mech as time goes on with better attributes or a skill tree with cool abilities nor does it offer any unique mechanics in future levels or introduce interesting enemies. \n\nA random example of a game that takes advantage of offering new mechanics/enemies without actually having any sort of character leveling system/skill tree is a game like Freedom Planet. Technically, every level is the same idea. It's a 2D platformer that has the player run to the right of the screen and make it to the goal, but every level feels unique, has their own interesting enemies/bosses, and has challenges that make them stand out from other levels. Pizza Titan Ultra sadly doesn't do this. Maybe one level takes place with a lot of water and others don't, but that's not nearly enough of a difference to make the level stand out.\n\nIt's a damn shame too, this game is a great idea but gets pretty stale really quickly.","timestamp_created":1585191419,"timestamp_updated":1585191419,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513492226600646973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x6+xivECcrmO+wE="}
