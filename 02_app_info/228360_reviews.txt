It did feel like Monkey Island and my favorite part was the fights against other bikers while riding your motorcycles.  However, the final boss could've been done better.  The fact I had a time limit to solve some of these puzzles, I think I had Ben go off the cliff at least 5 or 6 times.  But it's an enjoyable point and click adventure game and stands the test of time.","timestamp_created":1609995175,"timestamp_updated":1609995175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xZjM7fYCf8CYwQI="}
