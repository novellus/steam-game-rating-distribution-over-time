    review: 'This game is a mix of Papers Please and Among Us mini games, the latter
      to a lesser degree, and the former as a main inspiration. It gets really hard
      really quickly, but afaik there''s certain elements that are not randomized,
      so its definitely manageable with repetition or good memory. If you liked the
      memorization and multitasking of Papers Please this is a game definitely up
      your alley.


      As a person with terrible short term memory it was a pain to handle things after
      a certain point, but i definitely got farther than i thought i would. I think
      this game would definitely benefit from people writing down things on paper
      and checking them off screen.


      The story is definitely filled with charm from the voicelines each night and
      on each egg nog review from the eggnog connoisseur, and theres a sense of humor
      which delves on the absurd, which i really enjoyed.


      The art is pixel art and its pretty good and gets the job done because everything
      needs to be very legible at all moments, and it definitely does exactly that.
      I love the art on the window to show the city you picked, and also some of the
      ending screens were pretty detailed.


      Sound wise the music is pretty chill and the sfx were pretty ok, nothing really
      spectacular, but it works. I liked the credits song even though its not my style
      of music.


      FEEDBACK: I do have a few really minor complaints, but hopefully the devs will
      fix them if they do agree with me. Mainly key turning is awkward, also the floppy
      and robot mouth hitboxes are really precise, or at least they are when you are
      trying to be quick. I also found it annoying that i realized i had to reject
      an eggnog after generating the QA sticker, and i had no option to generate a
      new QA sticker, i had to stick with my previous wrong decision even at a point
      where i felt i could fix it. Also i didn''t understand the labyrinth part of
      the bomb, nothing looked clickable.'
