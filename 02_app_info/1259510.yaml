    about_the_game: "Tragedy strikes as the once magnificent entertainment and film\
      \ company, Rotnic Entertainment, vanished in thin air. The ones inside trapped\
      \ and restless to escape. Explore twisted, screeching halls and meet terrifying\
      \ abominations all desperate for revenge. Your anniversary is coming up soon,\

      \ you can receive a $10,000 reward if you find some studio... are you up for\

      \ From exploring an abandoned building haunted by stalking ghosts to parkouring\
      \ through a foggy cave, the main game is split into different lands, each with\
      \ their own bosses and mechanics. Each land is different and offers unique mechanics\
      \ and gameplay. With a flashlight in hand, you must find your way back home\
      \ and stay alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct 0 is an introduction to the game, you\
      \ learn the backstory to Act 1. You'll learn who you play as and why you should\

      \ minutes to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct 1 starts off slowly. You can explore\
      \ by your own free-will, take your time, explore around. As you explore, you'll\
      \ be haunted by the horrors of the remains of Rotnic Entertainment. The game\
      \ will then quickly pick up the pace and you will start to learn the crazy world\
      \ of Venge. You'll solve some simple puzzles as you are introduced to 5 unique\
      \ bosses. Each boss has its own unique art style and mechanics. Act 1 takes\
      \ about 1-3 hours to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct 0 - Free (Demo)<br />\r\n\

      \n=======<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVenge is an indie game created by Ekrcoaster, this\
      \ game contains 6 Acts (2 released currently) and plenty of unique minigames\
      \ that build off of the main game. The game is replayable with multiple endings\
      \ and sequences of events. The game starts slow but steady, as the game goes\
      \ on, it builds in intensity as you discover more and more. Explore and battle\
      \ creatures unlike you've ever seen. Each one different and each one challenging.\
      \ This game learns as you play and adjusts itself accordingly to give you the\
      \ best experience. Each new act will come with new adventures and so much more.\

    short_description: Tragedy strikes as the once magnificent entertainment and film
      company, Rotnic Entertainment, vanished in thin air. The building, employees,
      and any trace of them gone. This indie horror game will take you through the
      deepest and darkest pits of the once glorified company...
