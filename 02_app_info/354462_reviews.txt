There's something you should know about it.\n\nThe fake goddesses you need to kill are really high level. I'm not sure how high level you gotta be to kill them but it has to be at minimum level 100 or even 200?\n\nThat causes an issue. If you are on your first playthrough and not doing a newgame+ you might want to grab the conquest ending or any of the individual nation share endings.\n\nWell you will need to grind to level 200ish to just to do these quests which is something not a lot of people want to do unless it's in newgame+.\n\nSo if you are on your first playthrough this is probably not helpful. If you are in a newgame+ with things unlocked to help you grind, it's decent enough.","timestamp_created":1555907197,"timestamp_updated":1555907197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.691408097743988037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hPfSoeoCcoDevwE="}
