Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you have fun playing. In our house, our standard way to play is with two people on one computer. A grown up relaxes in a chair and controls the base. A child stands and operates the whompers and the cannons. About 15 minutes of whomping every other day or so seems to help chase away some of the current blues.
