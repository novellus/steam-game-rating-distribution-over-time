The level design is less encouraging towards taking alternate paths and finding secrets than the first one, the boss fights are just lesser versions of the first game's bosses (i.e. the Gladiator Dozer (Stage 3 of CotM2) takes several tactics from the Glutton Train (Stage 1 of CotM) while offering less opportunities to attack, not to mention Gremory (Stage 7)'s first form is outright taken from the first game (Stage 8). The option to forgo an ally by ignoring them or simply killing them for their power is also removed. \nZangetsu continues to be the all-around character until the Soul Eraser is acquired, which is equivalent to Ultimate mode in CotM, in addition to upgrading your subweapons. [spoiler] In Episode 2, the Soul Eraser is forgone for the Zanmatou, the blade made to seal demons. Unfortunately, it demotes your strength to its base by removing Soul Eraser's bonuses. [/spoiler]\nDominique is the Bloodlines expy of the group, wielding a polearm. Just as Miriam of the past, her jump is higher, and her weapon is longer. Her subweapons are magic spells, with the important ones being heal-focused. Golden lanterns drop the Resurrection Anthem, meaning in order to have everyone alive, you have to ensure that everyone dies before Dominique. If you happen to lose her, then you've essentially lost a life.\nRobert is a bizarre character. His rifle weapon travels instantly across the screen, allowing you to kill some enemies before they've even truly appeared. His subweapons are nothing to brag about aside from the D. Cannon, which is practically necessary with its kickback giving the player a vertical boost. Rapid switching between him with his wall jump and the next character's hover ability are necessary to exploit the game into getting one where they need to go.\nHachi is a meme dog with an enormous hitbox unlike any other. The ability to completely ignore spikes as well as an invincibility button subweapon says a lot about modern game design. The game feels justified in throwing dozens of enemies in one area simply because of invincibility. A character like this completely ruins the flow of what's already painfully slow gameplay.\n[spoiler] The past characters Miriam, Alfred and Gebel come back in the Final Episode, but they function just as they did previously. Gebel is needed for so many secrets and paths - the game torments you constantly with this fact by offering one block tall pathways that are raised, meaning Robert can't crawl through them, or with faraway doors that can't be flown to using Hachi and Robert's combination hover and wall jump. [/spoiler]\nJust buy the first game. It's better and cheaper.","timestamp_created":1609805804,"timestamp_updated":1609805804,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556239783763885498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnub55/YCdt7GwAI="}
