The audiovisual style is spot-on with a nastily sweet OPL2-esque soundtrack.\n\nOn the minus side, the view can get somewhat chaotic at times, and combined with the occasionally unfair bullet hell obstacles, the ball is lost regardless of what the player tries to do; and the physics can be somewhat off on some instances.\n\nNonetheless, a great game, made with love. Strongly recommended.","timestamp_created":1609759881,"timestamp_updated":1609759881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48s7K5vYCfrSuwAI="}
