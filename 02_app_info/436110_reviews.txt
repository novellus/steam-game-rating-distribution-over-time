I did pay for the DLC to support them though I cannot recommend a payment for the game in its current state. It has a severe bug (e.g. bow won't reappear if you cancel during draw); crippled fighting (the bow will just go off when the monster is close) and above all the clunky- and slow movement speed. Still these guys are on the right track if they fix that and add more content to it.","timestamp_created":1539518180,"timestamp_updated":1540642806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj/Pd2uYCe/7VrAE="}
