It feels like this should have been automatic considering a person who don't want the extra content could skip the DLC.\n\nThe second issue was the controls. I'm unsure if the performance of the game engine is dependent on the PC specs, but to me it felt like the bounces were unplayable fast. A danger comes in and I try and move a little to the side quickly, and I end up bouncing right into the wall and then back into the object I dodged. Thankfully there is also a cheat key to press for lives, so you can offset the bad game engine by removing the risk of game over. Which is a bad solution to a problem that shouldn't be there to begin with.\n\nAnyway, if all you want is the nude adult pictures, it is possible to get it for anyone regardless of PC specs. But getting a meaningful gameplay session seem to be a bit uncertain and not something I got out of my purchase.","timestamp_created":1595079363,"timestamp_updated":1595079363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m/GIsfMCfL6JlgI="}
