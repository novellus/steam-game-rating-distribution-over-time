There's a lot of things i don't like in the game\n\n1.To swing your melee weapon you have to hold Left Click Button and let go to swing all the weapons even with the daggers you still have to hold LCB and let go to swing, in normal games you can press once to swing your weapon.\n\n2.If press F or the scroll button to throw to weapon there's No cancel button if you change your mind and there's No cross hair.\n\n3.The enemies are not that fun to fight, some of them spam the block button, sometimes when they fall into certain places they teleport somewhere else, sometimes when you get hit you fly backwards and they all behave the same way.\n\n4.There's lack of variety with the weapons and enemies.  \n\n5.In the options you can't change key bindings.\n\n6.There's only one music the game and becomes so annoying when it keeps replay over & over.\n\nOverall even thought i bought this game on sale I feel like i got ripped off and its not worth buy for $12","timestamp_created":1609304935,"timestamp_updated":1609304935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pZGD2fYCeM/WvgI="}
