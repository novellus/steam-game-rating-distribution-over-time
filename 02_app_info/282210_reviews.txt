This is more of a space ship combat game where you build an empire, instead of a build an empire game with some space ship combat, if you catch my meaning. If you go into this thinking you are playing an interplanetary version of Beyond Earth or Alpha Centauri, you'll be disappointed. However, if you accept this for what it is (a fleet battle game where strategy is an asset to a better win, not a requirement to win), then you'll enjoy this just fine.","timestamp_created":1609663248,"timestamp_updated":1609663248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6P7Z4/YCdN6AwAI="}
