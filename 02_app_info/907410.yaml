      /><br><br>Hard Times is an extreme urban survival game where you have to put
      yourself into the shoes of a homeless man, taking on all the challenges that
      daily survival places in the great metropolis of indifference.<br><br>You will
      have to look into junk, beg for money, escape corrupt policemen and citizens
      maniac about decorum. You will feel hunger and cold. You will suffer in the
      long rainy nights and be glad when you can get a decent meal.<br><br>You will
      have to learn to build your own tools by yourself, craft and recycle objects
      to gain resources. You will make artifacts of all kinds, including furniture,
      work benchs, kitchens, beds, cardboard boxes, storage containers for your little
      treasures and much more.<br><br>You will probably have to give up your innocence
      to survive. Small thefts and looting will become a gesture of self-preservation,
      beyond any moral judgment. You will know the thrill of introducing into an abandoned
      property to take possession of it.<br><br>You can choose whether to become a
      squatter and build your base in the city, live in a homeless camp or move your
      stuff daily with a cart to sleep every night in a different place.<br><br>You
      will be hunting for rats and fishing radioactive fish to cook them in the live
      fire of an old rusty bin. You will contract illnesses, use drugs and experience
      on your skin as cold and indifferent the great metropolis can be for those who
      live Hard Times.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/907410/extras/200w_d.gif?t=1587982717"
