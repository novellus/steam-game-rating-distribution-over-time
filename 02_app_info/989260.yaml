    review: " I try all the baseball games so I decided to check this one out.  worst\
      \ game ever. \ngraphics look like a N64 game.  The ball wizzes by in a comical\
      \ fashion like it was programmed with one line of code.\n\nCatcher mode did\
      \ work.  As soon as I pressed the trigger the mitt disappeared.\n\nUmpire mode\
      \ feels like it was tacked on at the last minute.  There's a Cube with the default\
      \ Unity font shows if you called it correctly.\nNo sfx.  One line of code type\
      \ of stuff.  \n\n"
