    review: Really pretty artsy puzzle game. It's something like sudoku or another
      logic puzzle, but the visuals are designed from the bottom up based on the rules
      of inference that you'll figure out as you play, which makes for a kind of minimalist
      appearance. If you're in the mood to spend an afternoon with some clever and
      well-designed puzzles, you ought to try it out. Overall it isn't all too complicated
      and the new elements are introduced at an even pace. I finished it in about
      2 hours and enjoyed it a lot!
