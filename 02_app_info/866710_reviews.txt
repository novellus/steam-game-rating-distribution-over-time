In this game, you're a doctor returning to practise in a small town with a mysterious past.  Things have gotten stranger since you were last here, and you're plunged into the mystery immediately upon your arrival.  Note that the game begins with a chase scene from the POV of the scared young woman trying to locate the doctor; this is actually the prologue and tutorial. \n\nPros:\n- excellent length with lots to do\n- interesting story to draw you in (one or two confusing transitions, but minor)\n- lovely art (atmospheric too - I like the glistening rain-damp streets etc)\n- wide variety of puzzles (mostly moderate level, a couple a little harder)\n- wide variety of HO scenes (with one exception, well-crafted; one scene didn't accept a large bicycle wheel for \"wheel\")\n- two sets of collectables, both used to decorate your new home (for once, this was an enjoyable feature, not just rather confusing):  (1) black/gray pearls for buying new furniture and upgraded flooring etc; (2) fish tank items (um... for your fish... as you might guess ;)\n- decent music and voice acting\n- fully interactive map that manages the quasi-3D concept *well* (most are awful)\n- very good bonus chapter (note that there are more collectables here)\n\nI could go on, but there's a lot to recommend this game, and very few cons.  I suggest getting it on sale only because the Steam prices for the Big Fish games are very high, and there will be a sale eventually.  Either way, it will be money well spent.\n\n~Imp","timestamp_created":1594336946,"timestamp_updated":1594337105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.636638879776000977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xrL5mvMCdbSWlAI="}
