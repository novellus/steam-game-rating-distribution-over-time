    reviews: "\u201CGreat graphics; optional tactical control of carrier battle; lovely\
      \ details. Demanding hardware requirements for high graphic settings; thin sound\
      \ effects. A great simulation that both novice and veteran PC pilots can enjoy.\u201D\
      <br />\r\n95 \u2013 PC Gamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CIf you've got a DX2 or\
      \ better and fancy a fun, but ultimately short lived game that falls halfway\
      \ between flight sim and blaster, then go for Pacific Strike. For anyone else\

    review: This game is considered a classic. It was made when games came with 2-inch
      thick manuals that were as fun to read as the game was to play. Obviously it's
      an old DOS-based game, so don't expect great graphics (especially since it was
      released during what I call the "muddy phase" of sims, where clear graphics
      were sacrificed for the cutting edge effect of 3-D immersion), but this is about
      as comprehensive a Pacific Theater sim as you can find. Why no one has re-booted
      this game I will never understand. It's a lot of fun.
