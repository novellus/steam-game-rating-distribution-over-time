It's so stylish and wonderful to look at, and all the levels are clever and creative. It's deceptively simple - you move, and occasionally hit one button - but getting a good score in each stage is truly difficult. But you don't *need* to get a good score to have a good time, and if you have a lot of difficulty in any segment, the game gives you an option to skip it.\n\nThe story is pretty sparse and really just a long metaphor about pulling yourself together after your world falls apart, but this works in the game's favor, in my option. It's all about emotion and style, which grants it more substance than most games with drawn out, detail heavy narratives. I teared up at the end.\n\nAnd oh goodness, that music. SO good, and it accentuates every part of the gameplay and story. It's all just so seamless.\n\nReally, the only two issues with the game are the very short length (though I can't really imagine it being much longer and still having the same impact, plus you can always go back and try to get higher scores), and the difficulty and weirdness of the achievements (this is a nitpick since Steam achievements are mostly meaningless, but I do like getting as many as I can and after playing through the whole game, I only got one, lol).\n\nEven so, I highly recommend this, even at full price!","timestamp_created":1610082169,"timestamp_updated":1610082169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ioaY8PYCcN66wQI="}
