I played some Quake Champions and Diabotical in the past. Both are pretty fun and I absolutely love the feeling of the guns in QC as well as the movement. I'll be honest, there are aspects that I definitely prefer in QC and Diabotical over Master Arena, but MA just feels unique.\n\nIn my first hour of MA, I didn't really like it. But after I got a bit used to the game, I had really fun.\nThe game has it's flaws, but it's still in alpha and the devs are working hard on improving it.\nThat said, the game doesn't really have any bugs, apart from some rare crashes (had like 2 in 48h) and very few other things, that usually get fixed really fast.\n\nThe community is still really small, but there are a few very active players and the devs are very active as well. Just join the official discord and you'll have a good chance at getting someone that you can play a few matches with.\n\nThis game really deserves a chance, so if you like AFPS or want to give them try, please consider trying MA. You might not like it instantly but try to get used to the unique movement etc. a bit before judging the game.","timestamp_created":1609021424,"timestamp_updated":1609021579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ475vK0PYCeILFvQI="}
