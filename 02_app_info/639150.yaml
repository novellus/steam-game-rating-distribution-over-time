    review: 'First off, to play this DLC you have to spend $12.08, already starting
      off bad for a Timore game. Let''s get this out of the way however. Like the
      previous installments in this game, the game spends its majority of your playthrough
      trying to scare you with 1 thing and 1 thing only; Jumpscares. While this game
      puts in some background music to try and boost the atmosphere, it doesn''t work
      as seconds later you''re bombarded with jumpscares. The game does have a considerably
      more interesting concept than its base game. However, it doesn''t take long
      to realize the ''choose your unique response'' isn''t under your control at
      all, which was the only thing the game seemed to try and do different from the
      others. It fails to scare with lazy jumpscares and an even lazier ending, including
      the use of recycled resources from previous installments. The game is simply
      not a horror game when it comes down to it. Like its base game, it can be acurately
      described as: Jumpscare Simulator. The developer certainly needs to learn that
      the use of constant jumpscares DOES NOT WORK THE 6TH TIME AROUND, IT DIDN''T
      WORK THE 5TH TIME, TIME TO CHANGE IT UP. This game is not worth your money at
      all, especially considering you have to buy the terrible base game to play it.


      Edit: If you''re wondering how I''m reviewing this with 0 hours of play. The
      game adds your hours of play from the DLC, to your hours of play for the base
      game'
