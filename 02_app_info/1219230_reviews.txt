Bingo Hall is not meant to be a single player game. It is not \"dabbing\" the numbers for you, that is the summary screen telling the players which numbers have been called. \n\nIf you choose \"local\", you are responsible for providing players with physical (or virtual) cards to play along with and a way of validating numbers when BINGO is called (similar to a normal bingo hall that you would go to). \n\nIf you choose \"online\", there is a companion app (https://remotegoat.games) that all your players can join your game with and is a great streaming option. The companion app will provide them with virtual cards based on the number of cards you selected. When a player believes they have won and presses the BINGO button, the game will auto validate the numbers and pattern based on what you have selected as a host. If they win it will stop the game and announce the winner, otherwise they will get a \"strike\" for not actually having a BINGO (3 strikes and they can no longer submit for that round).
