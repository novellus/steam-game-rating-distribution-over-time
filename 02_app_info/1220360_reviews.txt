All three of my previous M.I.S.S. coverage of these developer came in May of 2019 and all three of those games were obviously made by the same person, but listed under different developer names here on Steam.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQBW5eLMgq8\n\nThis is just more of the same corrupt nonsense and just one more reason that Steam should be ashamed of what they allow on the Steam platform.  THIS is the kind of trash that gives both Steam and indie developers a bad image and reputation.\n\nZero score.  NOT RECOMMENDED.  This trash isn't even worth a nickel, much less $16 USD.","timestamp_created":1580112717,"timestamp_updated":1580135146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.73495328426361084","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoZzZ8+8Cc6e17gE="}
