      notes: 'This is a visual novel in which players follow an amnesiac as he uncovers
        the truth about a mark found on his arm. As players explore a mysterious mansion,
        they engage in dialogue and action choices that affect the story''s outcome.
        Some actions lead to instances of violence, with players using various items
        to defend themselves or attack enemy spirits. It has blood/gore, some partial
        nudity and sexual themes and one torture-esque scenario. '

    review: Figuring out the stories of the monsters is fun, even though the controls
      and ui feel bad. The game has a good atmosphere. The translation is a problem
      and it gets in the way of the puzzle solving, but nothing a quick reload can't
      solve.
