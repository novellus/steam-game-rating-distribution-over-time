    developer_response: Thank you for the review. I recommend updating Java on your
      computer for the lag.

    review: The game is very light weight and contains multiple level. It is very
      fast pace and would love to see Y-axis mechanics being implemented on it. The
      crosshair needs a little buff. Works Perfectly on my Intel Laptop but is quite
      laggy on my Ryzen Machine. Overall it is amazing and would love to see more
      improvements being done.
