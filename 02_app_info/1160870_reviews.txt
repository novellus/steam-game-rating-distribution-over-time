It has a compelling story, crystal clear sound, incredible graphics, hyperrealistic physics, meaningful dialogue, intuitive UI, a masterful soundtrack, character you empathize with, and voice acting that evokes emotion like no other. Its a tour-de-force that shows what indie developers are capable of. And with insightful commentary on modern society, this masterwork instantly becomes game of the decade. It truly is the game all other games strive to be.\n\n15/10, would shepherd gorillas in a circle again.","timestamp_created":1578890668,"timestamp_updated":1578890668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":16,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569011688232421875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/vTNzu8Ccc/W6wE="}
