If you didn't like VVVVVV, you still might like this one, because you are less constrained in your controls.  There is much more depth to its art design as well.\n\nThe Pixelated art design is great!  It is a very colorful, up beat approach to the dungeon aesthetic and the the music is quick tempo, helping to drive you towards your goal.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:  No time trials here (which makes me very happy) and achievements are dished out mainly based on regular playthrough.","timestamp_created":1510944614,"timestamp_updated":1513975732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540028095245361328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8or/v+ACdLzEiwE="}
