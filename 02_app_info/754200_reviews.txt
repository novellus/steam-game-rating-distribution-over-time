I foolishly bought the \"Deluxe Edition\" 'cause it was cheap, but this DLC sadly wasn't worth the additional 28 cents I forked out. \n\n   Chuck in the soundtrack, dev, and we'll call it even.\n\n   Verdict: 0.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1512816301,"timestamp_updated":1512816797,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625237524509429932","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1530146172,"developer_response":"Thanks for your review. \nAs much as I would love to put the soundtrack as well, since its from Kevin MacLeod under the Creative Commons license.
