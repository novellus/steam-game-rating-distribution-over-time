    about_the_game: "A great war once raged between the Sun and the Moon. Long battles\
      \ were fought to claim the skies, undulating between day and night as one God\
      \ would gain power over the other. Until one day, the Sun prevailed, banishing\
      \ the moon and locking the world in a state of permanent dusk. Plant-life began\
      \ to overtake the land, quickly reclaiming the realms of men and forming colossal\
      \ forests. Even the beasts were affected, Sun-sickness causing animals\u2014\
      and at times, even humans\u2014to become frenzied and violent. Under the reign\
      \ of an unending day, the world was tearing itself apart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      In this story-led action metroidvania, play as the world\u2019s final chance\
      \ of salvation: the last Spirit of Darkness, created by the Moon to seek a way\
      \ to restore balance to the celestial cycles. Traverse a dynamic, two-dimensional\
      \ world populated by wildly overgrown forests and Sun-maddened beasts. Exploration\
      \ is rewarded with currency, new powers, and lore. Run, jump, and\u2014in Spirit\
      \ Form\u2014fly to Explore levels scattered with secret paths, chests, and hidden\
      \ powers. As you battle your way through crazed owls, enraged wolves, and momentous\
      \ boss fights, you will steadily uncover a deep, myth-like tale that spans from\
      \ the very beginning of time itself."
