      \ soldier skin that comes with the pack would be held responsible for an astronomical\
      \ body count. Boasting unique head gear, enemies won't even have the privilege\
      \ of seeing your face before you dispatch them. Now that's cold.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nFurther adding to your arsenal, the pack also features 7 days worth\

      \ be the one on the wrong end of a stray bullet. Ensuring you're prepared for\
      \ such an eventuality, the Sniper Pack features 10 Resurrection Coins for the\
      \ Co-op mode to bring you back from the brink multiple times and give you a\
      \ freakish air of invincibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the Sniper Pack\

      \ on XP earned, 75% more Warface Dollars than you'd usually earn for your antics,\
      \ and 50% % faster item unlocks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Warface Sniper Starter\
