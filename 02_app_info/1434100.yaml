      /><br>Running through the underground, climbing walls and soaring the skies,
      there''s no place our hero can''t reach! Traveling with Cannon Lines, Molty
      will take on the most demanding and varied platforming challenges to reach Carrotland''s
      furthest and oldest Mailboxes: endless pits, giant boulders, steep slopes, bouncing
      platforms, sharp spikes..... tough roads! But when the power is out, you can''t
      send an e-mail!<h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome to Carrotland </h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1434100/extras/MailMole_Worlds_600p.gif?t=1604772488"

      freezing heights of Yeti Ridge, make new friends, race against unusual mech-rivals,
      solve puzzles and find all of the delicious collectibles scattered around Carrotland,

      /><br>In Peaceful Plaza, Carrotland''s main hub, you''ll meet a happy bunch
      of villagers, which are currently worried because of a fishy power outage. But
      worry not, as Molty will help to fix the power lines and receive some accessories
      as a reward! An elegant top hat, a goofy straw hat, a lovely bunny headband
      or a flashy jetpack will make Molty look like the coolest mail mole around!'
