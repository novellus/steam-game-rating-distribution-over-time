    about_the_game: You are a pilot who woke up high in the mountains after a plane
      crash. Snow is everywhere, harsh cold and you need to get out of here. Try to
      survive while you explore the darkest and most frightening corners of this place.<br><br>Beyond
      The Thaw is a storytelling and slightly walking simulator with elements of stealth,
      horror and adventure. We squeeze cinematography out of the Unreal Engine and
      work hard to create beautiful and cohesive gameplay scenes. Every detail should
      be meaningful, storytelling is more important than beautiful style.<br><br>As
      the player progresses, it is necessary to make quick decisions that require
      interaction with the game through the QTE (quick time event) - to run, hide
      from opponents (creatures and people), solve puzzles, plunging deeper into the
      game's history and conflict.<br><br>We have provided additional activities -
      fishing, chopping wood, riding a snowmobile, searching for herbs, so that you
      can just catch your breath and enjoy the process, but at the same time, each
      of these activities will work to reveal the plot.<br><br>You will meet both
      negative characters and positive ones. But at first glance, you never know who
      is in front of you. You always need to be on the lookout and face danger.<br><br>There
      will be a lot of collectibles in the game, it won't be easy to find them, but
      once you find them, you can learn more about the game world.<br><br>Key features:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> Frightening cold atmosphere<br></li><li> You are prey<br></li><li>
      Cinematic experience<br></li><li> Mystical story<br></li><li> Realistic graphics<br></li><li>
