    review: '6.5/10. The gameplay was unappealing; the story was interesting but left
      too much unspoken about the past, future, and overall state of the world.


      Technical details - presentation: nothing special going on. It''s a VN. Runs
      at a normal fullscreen, which I''m appreciating after trying to play a bunch
      of old adventure games with exclusive fullscreen at 360p. The art style is the
      teensiest bit interesting, but nothing too eye-catching.


      One thing I found incredibly annoying was the time delay after pressing buttons.
      It usually takes a full second or more for a new screen to appear after you''ve
      clicked a button, exacerbated by things like the quicksave button bringing up
      a dialogue box that says "saved"  with an additional button to click. Not a
      deal breaker but still very annoying.


      Gameplay: If you''re on the store page you''ve see it already, but this VN has
      match-3 gameplay: you have a grid with a bunch of symbols and if you match at
      least three in a row, they go away and you get points. The context here is that
      the main character is using this to  dominate the other person''s mind to get
      them to reveal information they wouldn''t normally. This is a Japanese otaku
      game, however, which means that there''s a sprite of their character next to
      the game, and when you score points the character moans like they''re getting
      penetrated, and as you pass certain thresholds they say something and then some
      of their clothing is removed, culminating with an orgasmic squeal when you get
      enough points. This is in effect a "mind break" scenario. This happens with
      mostly women, but there is one guy.


      It''s really just awkward, not erotic, because you''re focusing on the puzzle,
      trying to get these matches as fast as possible, while the character is squealing
      and squirming. It''s just a distraction.


      Anyway, there''s that. If you fail you get kicked back to the main menu. And
      some of the later ones are somewhat difficult.


      There''s also a fake Twitter where characters say things related to the plot.
      Minor spoiler: there is ONE point in the game where you must read through this
      (properly tagging the posts as "read") to get the correct ending for the chapter.


      Related to the above, there are moments where you can choose where your character
      goes (cafeteria, music room, rooftop, etc.). Most of the time this doesn''t
      really matter, but there''s at least once instance where you have to do things
      in a specific order.


      Apart from this there are also dialogue choices, initially just one for most
      moments, but later on it expands to two.


      Story:

      As the store page: you''re a new student at a school with 7 mysteries. You join
      the occult research club and begin exploring these mysteries.


      And that''s about as much as can be said without spoilers. There''s a lot, [i]lot[/i]
      more going on here. The lines on the store page "beneath the surface lie dark
      and sinister secrets" and "repeated playthroughs will yield new facts" can be
      taken as hints, but there''s still a lot of other stuff going on here that you
      won''t experience until 5 or 10 hours into the experience. The majority of the
      game is focused on things not indicated on the store page.


      As a result, it''s hard to review without serious spoilers, but there are a
      few broad statements which can be made.


      This game feels like as though it''s the second in a trilogy. There''s a wealth
      of lore here that just goes completely unexplained, along with references to
      past events and foreboding comments about the future. In a general sense this
      is mostly good, but be prepared for (a lot of) stuff that doesn''t resolve.


      This story is darker than it appears. Not quite edgy dark fantasy dark, but
      I was surprised a few times at where they took things.


      Certain events will likely prompt you to use a walkthrough. Hold off as long
      as you can, but if you play through the whole thing and can''t figure out how
      to proceed, use a walkthrough. I got most of the way through, but at the very
      end there were a couple things I just missed.


      Things like author intent and allegories are always dicey to work around, but
      one of the big reveals near the end of the game is really, really sketchy if
      viewed within the context of an allegory. It''s implying something that I''ve
      heard from Christian fundamentalists, so it''s a little weird.



      All in all it''s very, very difficult to appropriately discuss this game without
      getting into spoilers that would affect the experience. If you like anime stuff,
      slice of life, and (very, very) slight fantasy and noir elements, give this
      a shot.'
