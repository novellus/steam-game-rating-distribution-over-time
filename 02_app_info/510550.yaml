    review: 'personally one of the best bloody games ive ever played. the graphics
      story and graphics make the game one of the best games of all the time. it reminds
      me of one time where i was at disneyland tokyo and i was just sitting down after
      having a really exhilarating ride on the tron ride in disney world tokyo japan,
      i had just sat down on the bench located closest to the rides exit. it was placed
      in a seating area to sit around where the hyperion auto cafe was in tokyo. i
      was sitting there thinking and i thought to myself: "what if i were to make
      a game called something like i dont know congo merc where the gameplay is as
      good as is like in real life and then you go fight people upper congo lower
      congo congo everywhere!! i thought that would be a good idea" oops i meant to
      end the speech marks before anyway i thought that''d be a really good idea so
      i got to work coding. i coded and coded and coded and oh yeah im not sitting
      at the bench at disneyland tokyo japan anymore im at home on ps4 with my friend
      jay and we''re talking online about making a game called congo merc which could
      be a game with good graphics and story and video audio. he said it good idea
      so i got to work coding and i had an issue...! the game had bad graphics on
      the grass. so i took references by going to my neighbours astro turf (my neighbour
      has astro turf) and asked him for some astro turf. he said yes one clipping
      only so i took one clipping only and coded it into the game and finally got
      the grass in the game. with the game that id thought of at tokyo disneyland
      finally complete, i set to making the audio. i needed a sound of a gun since
      congo dandies in congo brazzaville have guns when people get in their way. so
      i got a gun sound by getting abuela tatis shoe and smacking it against the side
      of my room wall (my room wall is pretty thick meaning my parents didnt hear
      it and ground me!) with everything done, i went to export the game to upload
      to the stream greenlight program, before my computer crashed and i lost everything.
      so that is why i am here today, good job on the game even though mine looked
      a lot better and good luck in the future when making more games like congo merc!'
