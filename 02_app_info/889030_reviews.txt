The story is paced really well and the 5 hours passed very quick. This game doesn't have many choices and none of them are affecting the progression - which is great because i really grew tired of these VNs making you brute force all possible paths for tens of hours to finally get the \"real\" ending.\n\nThat being said, i completed this episode in one session because the story was really engaging. Grand Kokro tells a story about friendship, love and trust, along with metal illness and the \"bigger plot\" going on. It's a mix of great, wholesome and sometimes funny moments, as well as the dark ones which - not only once - managed to make me shed way too many tears. \n\nSome characters are a bit on the stereotype-y side but never to the point where it gets annoying and luckily these traits mostly are getting dropped as the story progresses. Most characters are really well written, the dialouges feel like actual people talking and their motivations are understandable. The protagonist - Elijah Grand - was very relatable to me on a personal level and i was always feeling what he felt (hence the tears).\n\nThe VN-framework Seram Studios have used has a lot of flaws - for instance you cannot enable fullscreen, if you resize the window, the texts and controls are buggy. This was only a minor inconvenience for me, because i played it via Steam Link (which basically scales the window's content to the tv's resolution). Otherwise you would have to find a way to scale the VN to fullscreen without affecting the actual window's size - i wouldnt know which software you could achieve that with.\n\nGiven the price and the length, there are few reasons to not play/read Grand Kokoro, if you are remotely into (BL) visual novels\nOne of the perfectly valid reasons to not read it is that the VN is everything but light-heared and some its themes may trigger you - please read the developer's description if you have known triggers.\nI absolutely loved Grand Kokro (Ep. 1) and all that's left for me now is waiting and hoping for the second episode.","timestamp_created":1548025056,"timestamp_updated":1548025056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597887873649597168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsPnetugCeOzpuAE="}
