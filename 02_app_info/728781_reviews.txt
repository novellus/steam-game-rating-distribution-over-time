I hate to say that I was disappointed. I got her good, neutral, and mutiny endings, and while I did enjoy the extra scenes with her, they were too short, especially the rope play one, which was the biggest let down as it ended so soon after it began. This DLC did not come with any new CG, which was the absolute biggest disappointment. I see that there is CG in the steam screenshots, so if there was a bug that for some reason skipped the CG, I would love to fix it. until then however this will have to be one DLC I do not recommend.","timestamp_created":1544600327,"timestamp_updated":1544600327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559763312339782715","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tdLW0OcCf6iOtQE="}
