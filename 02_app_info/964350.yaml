    review: I found the controls slightly difficult when choosing different options.
      The game leads you in a certain direction and I was unable to get any other
      endings. I'm not a hardcore gamer though and I'm sure others figured it out
      when I couldn't. I liked the side scrolling like set up and interactions.
