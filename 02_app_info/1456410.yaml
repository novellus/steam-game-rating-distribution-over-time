    review: Paper Shooter! is a game that you can just get lost in. Upon purchasing
      the game I played for over 3 hours without break and could easily have played
      for longer. Every time I started a new round I found myself trying different
      strategies and learning new ways to play. If you're looking for a game to just
      sink your teeth into for a couple of hours then I'd definitely recommend Paper
      Shooter! It's exactly what it says on the tin. 10/10 best early access game
      I've played in a long while!
