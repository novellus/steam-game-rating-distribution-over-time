    review: 'Though not as consistent as [I]Ominous Objects: Family Portrait[/I],
      this casual point-and-click adventure is an enjoyable sequel.


      Though not quite as long as the previous game, there''s still a lot of content.
      Generally, the puzzles and hidden-object scenes are also less interesting. The
      story starts strong, but loses coherence in the late game as it struggles to
      bring together an overly complicated plot. The characters are also less fleshed
      out, which may be part of the problem. The bonus adventure is especially weak
      as it rushes through with very little context.


      Still, it''s fun to play. Just make sure you start with the superior first game!'
