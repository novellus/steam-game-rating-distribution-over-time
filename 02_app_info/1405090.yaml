    review: 'Extremely shallow RTS. Not worth the price at all.


      All the factions are identical, just different skin / theme.

      Only 2 units, builder and soldier.

      Only 4 buildings. HQ, Barracks, Resource and Tower.


      Because of this, gameplay is always just "make more dudes than the other guy
      faster". No unit synergies or strategies.'
