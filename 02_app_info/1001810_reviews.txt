All I can say is that the gameplay itself is very very weak. The campaign depends on luck: there is a weird deadlock when you don't control all the checkpoints but you destroyed the AI.\n\nCluncky controls don't help much either\n\nOverall rating is 3/10 - no explanations or whatsoever and you will need to retry the levels more than once. The mouse controls don't work 70% of the time","timestamp_created":1569184744,"timestamp_updated":1569692188,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555481553077697754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1r+8vO0Cd83b0gE="}
