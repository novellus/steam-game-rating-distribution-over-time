    about_the_game: '<i>Turmoil - The Heat Is On</i> is a brand new campaign with
      tons of oil to dig up and convert into cash! It is designed to make you feel
      right at home, but at the same time offer lots of new mechanics and fun features.
      Here''s what you can expect!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A new town (and mayor!)
      and a new oil-rich map divided into three areas.<br></li><li>In each area, new
      drilling mechanics are introduced, powered by a new underground substance: magma.<br></li><li>You''ll
      see familiar faces like Edward and Fred and William. They brought their goods
      with them in train wagons, so you can instantly stock up on all your favorite
      drilling gear.<br></li><li>There are also new people, like Philip, who runs
      a shady card game in the saloon.<br></li><li>Jack is a new character that runs
      a magma tools operation from his shed. He likes chicken.<br></li><li>Anthony
      is also back from last time. Instead of dealing in diamonds, he has his own
      store where you can sell and buy all sorts of underground treasures.<br></li><li>The
      new mayor is not quite like the old one. His tips are free, and he uses a different
      auction system. But shares still cost money!<br></li><li>There''s a cat walking
      around the village! He doesn''t do a whole lot, but what can you expect from
      these creatures?<br></li><li>And last but not least: a couple of brand new music
      tracks!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Evolution</h2><br>A lot of the content in
      <i>The Heat Is On</i> is based on learnings from Turmoil. We noticed that not
      all of the players used natural gas to its full potential. That''s why we''ve
      lowered the entry level for using gas. From the start, Left and Right Inc. will
      have built-in gas intake capabilities. No more expensive upgrades needed, high
      oil prices for everyone! Overall, the exploitation of gas has been made more
      straightforward. Experienced players should however not be afraid that the game
      has become less challenging. Playing the drilling game is still all about making
      smart decisions under time pressure, especially in the final area!<br><br>The
      metagame in this new DLC-campaign offers more depth. Instead of diamonds, a
      total of 9 underground treasures are available. Collecting them all (by trading
      or digging them up) will offer great benefits. Besides this, the village offers
      even more things to do, like playing a card game for money.<br><br>Creating
      The Heat Is On has been a joy for us, we hope you''ll have as much fun playing
      it!'
