Took 10 hours to complete the main story and then the bonus story which unlocks upon completion. Ran full screen on my ultra-widescreen 21:9, which is always a plus since not all games, even new ones, eliminate the dreaded black bars. Has several degrees of difficulty and a hint system is also available, so no need for a walkthrough to play. Recommended 7.5/10.","timestamp_created":1609462498,"timestamp_updated":1609462498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrZjc3fYCeYChvwI="}
