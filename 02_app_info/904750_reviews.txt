I enjoyed it and it made me think on the puzzles, had a decent story, was very fun and interesting. I honestly loved it and i admit it took me longer than it should've. fun dinosaur dynamics with creatures that don't get the spot light often and you can tell work was put into making this game.\n\nHowever i would've loved to have had it been a bit longer, maybe reintroduce the carnivore that scared Zniw into running in the beginning and add a whole second arc to the adventure in the scattered woods or surrounding towns. though i'm sure the developer was getting tired of programming and needed a break so i understand the ending wrapping up like it did.\n\nLoved it, and would Love to see more in the future.","timestamp_created":1609122717,"timestamp_updated":1609122717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41IPM0/YCcZb7vQI="}
