You can't really navigate or explore, but the setting is nice looking and peaceful. The soundtrack is ambient and not distracting (good thing) and it was great to relax.\n\nIt's not perfect though, there's some choppiness at the tips of the mountains when moving your head. Additionally, it would be nice to be able to control the day/night cycle, turn off the words and navigate a bit. \n\nI'm glad I bought it.","timestamp_created":1505008898,"timestamp_updated":1505008898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/anhtN4CcZD5hAE="}
