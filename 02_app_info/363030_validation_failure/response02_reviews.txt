Some of the available extra balls can be obtained fairly early, while others require some patience and skill.\n\nThis table features the expected amount of bonus modes, some of which are multiballs with interesting twists, while others are single ball modes, which favour a steady hand. Each bonus mode is activated by meeting certain specific requirements, this way the table keeps repetitive activations of bonus modes to a minimum. You can basically combo liberally through the ramps and orbits while getting the next bonus modes ready over time, or you can focus on certain targets to speed up the process, if you so desire.\n\nA great feature of this table is the possibility to choose between 3 difficulty modes. After a few minutes spent on the easy difficulty, raising the difficulty really alters the feel of the table in terms of ball handling, time limits and, of course, the scores you'll rake in for successful shots. This feature is interesting for seasoned veterans and new players alike, as it offers a challenge for those who are looking for one, as well as an opportunity to grow for less experienced enthusiasts, who are determined to push themselves to a new level of play.\n\nOnce you figured out when and where the ball gets ejected after hitting a corresponding sink hole, you will have a very fair chance of catching it. Rarely, if ever, will a ball get ejected in a way that makes it impossible to catch, at least from my experience.\n\nIf you happen to be looking for a new table, consider this as a very good option.\n\n","timestamp_created":1436873073,"timestamp_updated":1436873073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638231992721557617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4luSTxs4CfKOBQQ=="}
