Lots of shots following people around walking to funky music. Not enough SEEING the games and SEEING the development. \n\nIt's so bad that you don't see all of the games...in a movie about making 12 different unique games.\n\nAnd don't let the title fool you, only 30 minutes is dedicated to the jam itself, then its 30 minutes of presenting the two winners to some big name companies, which just isn't waht I was expecting.\n\nAlso for how much they are charging the movie isn't even an hour long, and if you cut out all the bit-tune montages it'd be closer to 30 minutes. \n\nAgain I love the idea and certain parts of the movie were really interesting and fun to see. But so much time is wasted on looking at big houses or shiny looking events than the actual development of the game. If that's your thing then enjoy but for anyone wanting to watch a close hour long film about the JAM itself and the stress/drama it causes and how teams work so well in such a small amount of time. This just isn't for you. Disappointed.","timestamp_created":1523115405,"timestamp_updated":1523115405,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47JWw0OICfYXbnQE="}
