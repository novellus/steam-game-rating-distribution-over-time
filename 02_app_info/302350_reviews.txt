CHECK. [/b]\n\nIncredibly hard to write about a game that I can’t seem to distance myself from. The 90s were my formative years as a gamer and Under a Killing Moon is right up there at the top. It was a monumental release for its time.\n\nWhen a game earns the ‘classic’ moniker it means, amongst other things, that even the negative opinions about it have their place. That’s the whole point: its historical value stands beside your opinion, being informed and shaped by it, not above it.\n\nThis is such a game for me, it deserves to be looked over again and again, never forgotten. Even if it is to find it overly cheesy and riddled with 90s tropes. Even if the stellar cast seems wasted with very few lines. Even if you find yourself hunting for them pesky pixels. Even if, in the end, it’s just a cautionary tale of how the mighty are fallen.\n\nNothing I could write would add anything significant to a library of reviews and analysis already done about this game. This here is just for the record, almost like an obligation, a reiteration of vows.\n\nFor me, the only thing that matters is you, and how will you feel after playing it. Your move.","timestamp_created":1609250163,"timestamp_updated":1609250163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k5my1/YCca+5vgI="}
