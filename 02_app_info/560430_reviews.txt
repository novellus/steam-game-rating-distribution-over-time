The amount of multiple things you need to concentrate on is large and present in this game and you have to be fast in order to survive and move on. The thing that makes me angry most about this game is that once you fail or make one mistake it'll cost you the entire level and you'll have to do the entire level all over again. And once again each level you have to focus on multiple things making some of the levels hard. But this game was really cool for its time and even is now.","timestamp_created":1609795079,"timestamp_updated":1609869745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ttvt6fYCcsrBwAI="}
