    review: "Do not buy this, its utterly appauling. The people who made it dont understand\
      \ the rules of rugby or the players. world class players being given below average\
      \ ratings, no instructions how to play it. The graphics are shit dont for one\
      \ moment think the video is what its like. This is so utterly poor and I want\
      \ a refund for a totally shit game clearly made by amateurs. To ask \xA330+\
      \ for this is fucking scandaleous"
