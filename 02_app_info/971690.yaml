    review: 'Toast marshmallows, punch a bunch of other cakes, shop for toppings,
      balance the ice cream, kill wasps, go to the beach, crack fortune cookies and
      it''s just so cute not to play.

      Guess you''d have to play online and ''matchcake'' with other cakes to unlock
      more games but then, it''s equally as fun too.

      Played the demo first and didn''t even have to think twice about buying it.


      Note: Yes, turns out as the developer commented that you won''t really need
      to be online and do matchcaking to get the other games, flavors etc. I find
      that playing online and playing solo is both fun. The bots won''t take it easy
      on you!'
