      /><br><br>Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and
      management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress
      and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton
      crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll
      probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board
      as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your
      Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the
      foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on
      and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are
      also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee!<h2 class="bb_tag">Meeple
      need things to live! </h2><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/900010/extras/divider.png?t=1598585804"

      /><br><br>Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple
      will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food!  Make
      sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station.
      Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings
      or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the
      damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive
      place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station
      and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining!
      Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in
      many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors-
      so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire.<h2 class="bb_tag">Trade!
      </h2><br>At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't
      effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you
      can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources
      and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update,
      we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan
      to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly
      construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are
      new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system,
      you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different
      planets.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fight off lazy pirates! </h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/900010/extras/divider.png?t=1598585804"

      shields and turrets work wonders against bombers.<br><br> <br>We have so many
      big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their
      scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly

      over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to
      share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based
      trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really
      can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future!  Seriously,
      we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies.
