This seems like it would be very fun, and it is extremely effective when it works, but unfortunately the ability is incredibly unreliable, for multiple reasons. \n\nThe throw to deploy the satchel charge isn't like throwing a grenade, which works very well in this game. Instead it's a very short range underhanded lob that the game seems to treat as though the charge came out of your characters foot, because if you stand behind any kind of cover when you throw the charge it's practically guaranteed to end up stuck to the cover instead of flying toward the enemy.\n\nSince the charge doesn't go on cooldown until you've detonated it this then either fouls your cover, forcing you to abandon it so you don't blow yourself up making your ability unusable until you've moved away from the area and can safely detonate the charge.\n\nIf you experience lag at the time of throwing the charge it seemingly appears at a random place without showing you its arc on the screen, and sometimes simply disappears without any effect.\n\nThe flashbang grenade doesn't seem to affect bosses, which is kind of silly, since it's not like you can kill them in the 5 seconds of stun you get every 30 seconds with this. It should at the very least debuff them in some way.\n\nNone of these issues affect the grenades in the game, which begs the question why the charge isn't thrown like a grenade. That would give it the range and reliability to be a top notch power and make the demolitionist a great class to play, but as long as your character can't reliably throw this thing, and can't throw it far enough to actually deploy it where its useful it's hard to reccommend spending 20 bucks on this class.\n\nI will amend my review when the issues with this class are fixed.","timestamp_created":1530997086,"timestamp_updated":1530997086,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567213118076324463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw87Kiu+QCc6TApQE="}
