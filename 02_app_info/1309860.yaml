    about_the_game: You are Nancy Bradford, a talented daughter of famous scientists
      who died under mysterious circumstances 20 years ago. Your recent studies, concentrating
      on mind control, draw attention from a prestigious Neurotech Institute as well
      as the CIA, which resulted in an unusual offer. Continuing studies within the
      walls of a top-secret laboratory and getting a huge grant is surely enticing,
      spying on the other hand sounds like a risky job. Brace yourself as it's just
      a kick-off for a deadly game!<br><br>Third instalment of the Family Mysteries
      series plunges you into a sea of action, double agents, brainwashed patients,
      murky experiments, nerds and conspiracy theories. A thrilling example of spy
      fiction with upfront overtones of X-Files, that should satisfy even the pickiest
      fans of the genre as the story unfolds at a breakneck pace and keeps you immersed
      to the very last minute!<br><br>Avoid being uncovered, save the mankind and
      discover the old family secret, which will shed some light on the past!<br><br><img

    review: "[h1] A mediocre game [/h1]\n\nYou are a scientist with a mysterious past\
      \ and you get a shady job offering you cannot refuse. The third instalment of\
      \ the \"Family Mysteries\" has nothing to do with the great detective story\
      \ of part one or with the sci-fi abomination that was part two. It's a mediocre\
      \ game but OK. I was not bored.\n\nPositive\n+ The story is fine\n+ The graphics\
      \ are really nice (as usual)\n+ Cutscenes \n+ The sound and music are good\n\
      + Map \n+ Collectables\n+ There is an extra chapter, which is OK\n\nNegative\n\
      - a handful of potholes\n- no Journal, just objectives\n- The narration is just\
      \ OK\n- The Character portraits are not that good\n- the minigame were not very\
      \ good\n\nIf you're interested, buy it on sale.\n"
