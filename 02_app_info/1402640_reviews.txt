To view it you need to go into the folder of the game and open it there.\n\nThe Guide is very helpful and has some nice extra things. Like a good guide it shows you who loves/hates what gift and how to increase the one you want to love you. You can use it to find out how to unlock the secret ending (and in a way all the achievements).\n\nThe only thing that bugs me about it the order of things. I'd like all the parts to do with Sota be one page after the other and Lenga to be one page after the other and so on. Right now it's per day so E.G: you picked Rald, all the ups and (no change) for the Spa massage are there. Next to that is Spa Bath - Sota Route 4 pages down (page 58 to 62) is Spa Bath - Rald Route. It's not all grouped in one part (like other guides). \n\nIn the end all the info you need is there and you can read a nice little story at the end. The minor part is over shadowed but the rest.","timestamp_created":1598617428,"timestamp_updated":1598617428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.661066710948944092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgsTBmvQCcuemngI="}
