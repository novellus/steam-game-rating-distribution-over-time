    review: "There is a lot of game here for a very low price. 5 hours in and I have\
      \ barely managed half the levels. The mechanics are good. Charges move consistently,\
      \ so often a solution is to create a lucky path rather than using control elements.\
      \ The challenges are quite varied tasking you in different ways. At times it\
      \ is frustrating and at times rewarding. The graphics are rather crude and simple,\
      \ music is meh and the interface is acceptable. No bugs or crashes. Runs fine\
      \ on Linux. My main problem with these types of games, is I find them too short,\
      \ but this isn\u2019t an issue here. The developers put in a lot of content.\
      \ The sub-circuits are well made and fit naturally in the game. Overall, it\u2019\
      s a challenging game that should keep you entertained for quite some time for\
      \ a pittance.\n\nAdditional:  Completed after 50 hours. The level design is\
      \ outstanding. Willing to pay for more."
