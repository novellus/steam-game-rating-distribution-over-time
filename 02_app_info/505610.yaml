    review: "[SPOILERS BELOW] \n\nZombie's films have been known to have shock value\
      \ expecially when it comes to the explicit violence, language, and sex. This\
      \ one was no different! From beginning to end there's all 3 of those things.\
      \ The ending of the film had my jaw on the floor and I loved every second of\
      \ it. Doomhead is one of the most menacing villains I've ever seen in a horror\
      \ film and even he made my skin crawl with his crooked smile and switchblades.\
      \ Though, the only problems with the film I had was that I really wanted more\
      \ backstory behind the people who were running 31 and how they got those people\
      \ to agree to be part of the game. Also some of the scenes could have been shot\
      \ a little better. The chainsaw fight was extremely shakey and it was hard to\
      \ tell who got hurt or who was swinging until the scene was over. \n\nAside\
      \ from that, I did enjoy the film! If you like Rob Zombie's work then I highly\
      \ recommend it!"
