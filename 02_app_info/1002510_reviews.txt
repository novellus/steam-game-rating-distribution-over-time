The ending hit me harder than it should have and it hurts. It's an amazing story that's well executed and I'm happy I spent my time on it. I'd also recommend Her Lie I Tried to Believe. especially before this one, because although a bit different in terms of store it also has a twisting end that hits you.

I'm off to play the next game!","timestamp_created":1609823112,"timestamp_updated":1609823112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtOm76PYCeMnNwAI="}
