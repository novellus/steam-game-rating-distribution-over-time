It is in 3D!!!! Where you as a main character are mortal so you have from age 18 to old age to make millions or just some scrap, After death you can play onward (what happens after is not yet implemented). You can specialize in 4 branches web developer, mobile apps, game dev and app dev (not yet implemented). When creating own projects you can mix and match those categories. But own projects are for later stages of the game as it depends on amount of fans you or your company (separate count) has. You can also buy furniture and decoration stuff to place it in your office. To summarize the game has potential, can't wait what the future updates will bring.","timestamp_created":1608379316,"timestamp_updated":1608379316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8pa4vfYCfq61uwI="}
