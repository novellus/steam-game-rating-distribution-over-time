      /><br>Hoards of Glory is a dice placement game for 1 to 4 players OR take on
      Viking AI characters in a single-player game! Players take on the role of a
      Viking captain, traveling the known world seeking companions and treasure. Each
      turn represents a year in which you acquire wealth, attack competing players,
      and defend yourself from retaliation. But depending on how wealthy you are and
      the luck of the dice, rarely can you do all three at the same time. Hard choices
      will have to be made to fulfill the pattern objectives on your player card and
      win the game game and the favour of the king!<br><br>Developed as an answer
      for how to playtest an upcoming Kickstarter boardgame campaign during a pandemic,
      Hoards of Glory has grown into a full video game offering! A game takes about
      15-20 minutes and is accessible to players as young as 8 years old.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>It is a simple game to learn, but not so easy to win, particularly
      if Veridandi of the Norns shows you no favor when you roll your dice!<br><br>Each
      player has a Boast they must live up to, represented by a Boast Card. To win,
      they must be the first to fill in all the Tasks on their Boast Card by rolling
      dice, and matching dice results to slots on the card.<br><br>Players begin with
      five coins and four dice, each one a different color; Red, Green, Yellow, Blue.
      Four sides represent wealth, but one side is a shield and another a spear. Players
      roll these dice and use the results to fill in their Boast Card, Attack other
      players, Defend themselves from attack, or earn more coins, which are then used
      to buy more dice. Who will be the first Captain to complete their Boast Card!

    review: "I actually like this little game. \n(I don't have time to write a full\
      \ review -but this game severely needs more reviews, so I'll do a SHORT one.)\n\
      \n*AI seems balanced and I feel challenged even on Easy (but I'm a noob too,\
      \ so keep that in mind)\n* surprised me w/ amount of strategies there are.\n\
      * can save the game & come back to it later\n- music is alright, but I got annoyed\
      \ with it after 15 mins since I think it's only 1 track (not counting the song\
      \ at the main menu)\n* I like being able to move the dice around before committing\
      \ to an action. it helps me organize my thoughts\n\n* sound effects are good.\
      \ there aren't many, but they are there for everything you would expect to make\
      \ a sound. ie: spear attacks, defending, coins jingling off each other when\
      \ you collect them at the end of a round\n*voice overs= what's here works, but\
      \ it's not a story-based RPG or anything, lol, so Idk what you expected. there\
      \ are voice lines every so often like when someone wins a reward they go \"\
      YES!\", when you use a defend die \"I'm Holding\". just little lines like that\
      \ which make the game feel more alive is a nice touch. I'll have to play more\
      \ to see what else they say in certain situations\n\nAll in all, I like it.\
      \ it's simple, but there's strategy to it and enough animation and physics to\
      \ make it more interesting than...say a real life dice game. :D\n\n(will update\
      \ later after I've played a few games. I spent my time playing Single player\
      \ vs. 2 Easy AI)"
