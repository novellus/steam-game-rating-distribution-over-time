    review: 'It''s definitely a nice addition to the original game, but some of the
      routes were clearly worse than the others. But at the very least we got to see
      more of the 4 girls, Rise, Chiho, Ayaka and Ritsuko we all know and love and
      that''s always a positive. While I was happy about Ruriko finally getting her
      well deserved spotlight, the ending felt pretty odd, at least to me. Nonetheless,
      I''m happy overall, especially since Princess Evangile was my first ever visual
      novel.


      As for best girl... It''s so hard to choose between Rise and Chiho. On another
      day I might say Chiho, but right now, I''d say Rise!'
