    review: I have yet to drop this game sense i bought it and im writing this because
      i have found my one and only (current) gripe with the game and it is that some
      of the small thrusters don't have a Left/Right counterpart AND IT REALLY TRIGGERS
      MY OCD BECAUSE I WANT MY MECH TO BE SYMMETRICAL... anyways 9.9/10 please keep
      up the good work and this probably wont stop me from playing the game
