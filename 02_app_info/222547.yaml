    about_the_game: "The Class 422 \u20184BIG\u2019 was a slam door classic across\
      \ the south coast routes of England and is now available for Train Simulator.<br><br><br>The\
      \ 4BIG was similar to the standard 4CIG EMU but contained a buffet car in place\
      \ of an intermediate trailer, thereby consisting of two driving trailers, a\
      \ non-driving motor coach and a buffet car. The first 4BIG was delivered into\
      \ service in late 1965 from BR York Works, and up until 1972 were regular units\
      \ on south coast passenger services.<br><br><br>The fleet of 4BIGs lasted more\
      \ than 40 years in service, initially on Brighton line services, later on the\
      \ Waterloo to Portsmouth route and eventually across the Southern network. Following\
      \ privatisation of the UK railway network, 4 BIGs were operated by Connex South\
      \ Central up until 1997 when some were transferred to South West Trains. The\
      \ redundant units were refurbished and re-allocated to other EMU classes. Despite\
      \ being replaced by more modern EMUs, such was their popularity that many 4BIGs\

    review: 'As much as I love these old slam door units, this pack is a waste of
      time and money. All you get is one livery and three scenarios, and the one career
      mode scenario they made is completely stupid. The train doesn''t even have a
      headlamp, but they expect you to drive in the dead of night for those 1000 points.
      It''s impossible to see! How are you supposed to complete a nighttime scenario
      when you don;t have a light?!


      If you have the Class 421/423, skip this one entirely. To my knowledge, nobody
      uses it in third party scenarios, so just skip it.'
