      \ Duplex, are brought to life in the breathtaking new Ligne Grande Vitesse:\
      \ Marseille Saint-Charles to Avignon-TGV route for Train Simulator.<br><br>Construction\
      \ of the LGV M\xE9diterran\xE9e began in 1996, designed as a dedicated high\
      \ speed line that spans over 160 miles to connect the South-East of France to\
      \ the nation\u2019s capital, Paris. The LGV M\xE9diterran\xE9e extends from\
      \ the end of the LGV Rh\xF4ne-Alpes in Valence and terminates at Marseille via\
      \ Avignon and Aix-en-Provence.<br>Opened in 2001, the LGV M\xE9diterran\xE9\
      e is operated by SNCF\xAE with TGV Duplex high speed trains, operating on the\
      \ 25kV AC catenary system, capable of reaching 320 km/h. These revolutionary\
      \ high speed trains slashed journey times to the South coast of France with\
      \ TGVs now handling the vast majority of all journeys in France, covering some\
      \ 750 km (470 miles) in around 3 hours \u2013 faster than some domestic airlines.<br><br>The\
      \ line serves a total of 4 stations, featuring three purpose-built structures,\
      \ the Gare de Valence TGV, a uniquely built multi-level station allowing easy\
      \ transfer between the high speed and local services, Gare d\u2019Avignon TGV,\
      \ made popular by its close proximity to Avignon city centre and Gare d'Aix-en-Provence\
      \ TGV, allowing easy travel into the north of Marseille and Marseille Airport,\
      \ accessible by regular bus services. The final station is Marseille-Saint-Charles\
      \ - a terminus station previously built to serve the surrounding area and the\
      \ French Riviera, access to this station is via the classic French main lines.<br><br>Due\
      \ to the undulating nature of Southern France\u2019s terrain, the LGV M\xE9\
      diterran\xE9e features many steep inclines and declines, not to mention the\
      \ impressive number of vast cuttings, tunnels and viaducts that traverse the\
      \ landscape, the longest tunnel being over 8 km (5 Miles) long. Not only is\
      \ the outstanding scenery a wonder to behold, the LGV Med. regularly sees 300\
      \ \u2013 320 km/h operation providing a fast, reliable service with the beautiful\
      \ southern France countryside flying past the upper and lower windows.<br><br>The\
      \ route is equipped with the TVM430 (Transmission Voie-Machine) signalling system,\
      \ a revolutionary in-cab signalling system designed for operating high speed\
      \ trains in high capacity. Conventional signalling is not practical for very\
      \ high speed routes, as drivers have very little time to see and react to what\
      \ flies past the windscreen. TVM430 displays information in the cab telling\
      \ the driver what speed he should be travelling at, without the need for conventional\
      \ track-side equipment.<br>Included with the 100km Marseille to Avignon high\
      \ speed route is the iconic TGV Duplex in SNCF livery.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><ul\
