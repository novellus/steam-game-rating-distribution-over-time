Adds uniqueness and distinction from other games on the market.\n-Sounds: From the ambient music to sound effects, the devs nailed it. The sounds monsters and zombies make is so creepy. Being able to hear accurately where monsters are relative to my position easily could have killed immersion but it did anything but that.\n-Graphics: Really good for a vr game in early access. Texture quality is awesome. I only expect it to get better as updates progress.\n-Enviroment: Dead bodies, TVs that give hints, high texture quality in miscellaneous items. I just wish I could interact with more things. Something about VR turns us into kids again and we just have to pick up stuff.\n-Objectives: I like how this game isn't just a repetitive hack and slash through hordes of zombies. There's objectives and purpose. You need collect certain items to get a result. Having to go room to room and experience what the devs put so much hard work into. Even something as simple as that adds to the experience.\n-Scary: This game is actually scary. From the tensness you feel not knowing when danger will strike and it is inevitable. Jump scares are there but not so much which is good. The environment and sounds paint a perfect horror picture.\nGameplay: The perfect mixture between horror and action. It's not a stressful psychological horror where the game is just mental torture to see how many jump scares and helpless encounters you can stomach. It's also not constant violence that eventually feels like cutting grass. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.\nExperience: This is the most element that will make or break a vr game, period. I felt like I was in a horror world. I was scared out of my mind being snuck up on in vr but also having the power to defend myself unlike most horror games that coin themselves psychological horror games.\n\nMiddle (or unsure how to feel)\nGunplay- Pretty Arizona Sunshine-esque except you manually reload your weapon. Reloading can be a little bit more realistic but at least you get to go about the motions unlike games with auto reload (hate those). I would like an option added to turn off the laser. I enjoy having to aim down sights for an accurate shot.\nWeapons- The current weapons seem polished and accurate to how they function in real life. I just wish there were more. (Yes I'm American) I need all the wampons and ammos.\nStory or backstory?- I am getting a vibe of a plot, story, or backstory here. I'm not sure though as I haven't spent much time in game. This review will be updated as I experience more.\n\nCons\n-Lighting: I get that dark equals creepy but in VR dark just looks like walking around with a black t-shirt over your eyes. I also record gaming videos and dark colors or the absence therein give me nothing to work with in editing.\n-Voice Over: Can honestly do without the voice over in a game that seems to be more horror and slow paced. There are some intense moments and battles but during the build up to them when things are slow it doesn't make any sense that the character being played as has something super loud to say. (IMO)\n-Hands: At this point with VR in 2020 I would really like it if instead of seeing only my hands I could see my entire body in game. It adds to immersion in my opinion.\n-Interaction (with self and environment): I talked about wanting to pick up more things and interact with them although most games abuse this into almost being completely gimmicky it still adds to immersion. I have trouble locating my ammunition to either pull some out to reload or to simply stock up. Items on my person seem to get in the wah when i try to grab something on the ground which can be annoying.\n-Sprinting: I'd like an option to not have to swing my controller around to sprint.\n-Lack of Multiplayer: I feel like I must play this with someone. I just get a Call of Duty Zombies vibe from this game and I'd love multiplayer capability. Even if it's with random people.\n\nVerdict\nThis game is Early Access and I treat it as such. I see so much potential in this game. However, I had to double check if this game was in Early Access because it seems more polished than a lot of those kinds of games. Seeing it's still in development is actually exciting to me. I like this game a lot and hope it gets better. I would mostly like to see multiplayer support above all other things. There's nothing I found in this game that ruins it for me or renders in unplayable. I reccomend this game on the notion that it is decent and can only get better. Good purchase for the asking price. Well done. üëèüëè","timestamp_created":1587278289,"timestamp_updated":1587278888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxLfMyPECftnzgQI="}
