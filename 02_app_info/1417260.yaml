    review: You'll find no better way to blow stuff up on the ground. Not too hard
      of a learning curve, this was my first module getting into DCS and though it
      took time to learn the systems it was pretty easy to use the displays once you
      get the hang of it. MAV is a bit clunky sometimes.
