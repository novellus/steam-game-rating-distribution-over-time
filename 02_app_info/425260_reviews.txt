I can't wait to see what else they have in store for this hidden gem!Remember this game is in ALPHA; (and I will be adding more to my review the more I play the game to give more in depth detail) but in it's current state it is still VERY fun to play and well worth the price.Edit#1) The game is still very satisfying to play, and with the addition of the map editor, more additional content is always great! Still enjoying the game! (don't let my hours fool you, most of the time I am playing offline)Final Edit. The game has been abandoned, I have tried reaching out to devs no response. Sad. Could have been something. Move on folks.","timestamp_created":1495918430,"timestamp_updated":1600288827,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591962873935699463","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ457SpzPQCdNOLeg=="}
