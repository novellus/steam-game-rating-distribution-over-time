However, thanks to Rebellion, TRO has been updated and remastered, and the result is great. The campaigns contained in TRO are extremely difficult as the developers expected you to have played and mastered the original campaigns in the first game, but the challenge is still satisfying and entertaining. When the original missions in the game have become commonplace for you or too easily completed, TRO gives you more meat to chew on. Strategy plays a big factor (as does the new cloaking ability) and the Chinese units are interesting and fun to play as.\n\nUnsure of the reason for so many of the negative reviews. Just because it is \"hard\" does not make it a bad expansion. Certain missions have annoying sections, but the point of this port is to provide BZ players a remastered and improved copy of an expansion pack many missed out on playing. And the size of this expansion isn't negligible either. You're given two full-sized campaigns including an entirely new set of units. This is a bargain for the asking price (especially in the BZ98R + TRO bundle Rebellion has provided), nearly doubling the content of the original game.\n\nI highly recommend The Red Odyssey expansion to any fan of Battlezone, just be aware that it requires you to understand the deeper mechanics of the original game.","timestamp_created":1514009904,"timestamp_updated":1589260002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwreTRg/ICc+WNkwE="}
