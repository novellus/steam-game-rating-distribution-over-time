(Mr. P....)\n\nThe things that I can only comment about are:\nCaptain Quickdraw - OMG his voice was painful.\nSkills - Apparently the hero units had them. I think I only really ever used them in the beginning, once or twice perhaps.\nArtifacts - The Passive ones are great. The Active ones... never found a need for them. Ever.\nDifficulty - Never found the game too hard, but I did reach a point where with the right ship and upgrades I would dominate every sea battle. As for the land battles, same thing happened once I unlocked two hero units.\nJokes Collectibles - Seriously how is it possible to have 1001 Pirate Puns?!\n\nStill worth some time if you look for a tongue-in-cheek pirate game.","timestamp_created":1595318932,"timestamp_updated":1595318932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwouKauPMCec/UlgI="}
