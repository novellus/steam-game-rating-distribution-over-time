Along with the fact that while you play sometimes it just doesn't record that you pressed a button, or will say that you pressed the wrong one. This error gets even worse the faster you start to type. I did complete everything it has to offer, and exceed its expectations... but then after that there is nothing else to do. No more challenges, nothing. \n\nIn short, if you want to learn to type and are just starting or aren't very fast. This will be good for you to try, especially if you're okay with some errors every now and then in the software. \n\nIf you actually want a software that will continue to challenge you, and will continue to progress, then this is not the software for you. Especially if you can already type decently and don't do well with the software errors.","timestamp_created":1585019214,"timestamp_updated":1585019214,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571070492267608643","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi7ughfECcdjE+gE="}
