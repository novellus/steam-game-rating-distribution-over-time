The game starts with some random fetch quests that probably wouldn't have annoyed me if the walking speed wasn't so terribly slow. Once I got out of the apartment I realized all the dialogue and plot seemed pointless and random. I refunded it.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n+ Unique art style\n+ Okay music\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n+ Slow walking speed\n+ No auto walk when you click on items. You need to be on top of them first to interact.\n+ Boring dialogue.","timestamp_created":1530930948,"timestamp_updated":1530930948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498947381973266602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+oymueQCd9u2pQE="}
