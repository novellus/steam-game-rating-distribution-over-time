It has just under a dozen different game modes, tons of levels, and changes things up with some modern innovations and custom modes. Some of the extra stuff involves having to play certain carts twice to remove them, having some cards visible but unable to be played until another card is used, and more.\n\nGreat game and goes on huge sales frequently!","timestamp_created":1609383632,"timestamp_updated":1609383632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyKuv2/YCfbz9vgI="}
