      \ railway lines come together in the stunning new Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network\
      \ route for Train Simulator.<br><br>The broad network of railway lines connected\
      \ some of the north east\u2019s largest town and cities with collieries across\
      \ the Pennines, with the first line opening in 1825 that connected the collieries\
      \ near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees via Darlington.<br><br>At this time, the\
      \ line was a mere 25 miles in length, but by 1860 it had grown considerably\
      \ with extensions and branches to virtually every corner of Weardale and Teesdale,\
      \ covering more than 100 miles. The original line is probably most famous as\
      \ being the world\u2019s first public railway to use steam locomotives when\
      \ they were first introduced in 1833.<br><br>The area was linked with a prestigious\
      \ and long list of railway heritage, with several railway-related works and\
      \ engineering facilities to be found throughout the network. Darlington Railway\
      \ Works, responsible for the building of many steam and diesel locomotives,\
      \ was built in 1863 and survived until the Beeching Axe in 1966. Shildon Railway\

      \ Dr Beeching, whose sweeping changes to the British rail network in the 1960s\
      \ closed many of the branch lines to passenger traffic. As collieries closed\
      \ and freight traffic reduced, by 1980 there was virtually nothing left of the\
      \ famous routes as they were once known.<br><br>Towns such as Crook, Tow Law,\
      \ Barnard Castle, Piercebridge and Bishop Auckland \u2013 once bustling railway\
      \ towns \u2013 lost their stations and trackbed lifted, and today visitors to\
