    review: 'This is just the worst (EDIT: after the free episode 2 came out and games
      without content on steam, i cant say that anymore) game on Steam. Playtime for
      the whole game is around 2  (EDIT: now 4) minutes. All parts of the game, handling,
      graphic, sound are awfull. The best part of this mess is this sentence from
      the storefront-description:


      "The most interesting feature of this game is that if you shoot the goons and
      they don''t die, you have to shoot at the places surrounding the attackers to
      kill them."



      Here is a full walkthrough of the game (i played it twice to see, if the abrupt
      ending is not just a bug):

      UPDATE:


      Episode 2 came out as a free dlc. While it is still a mess, e2 is better then
      the first episode. Graphics, sound and handling are still awefull, but it is
      much more playable. Playtime around two minutes. But i am impressed, that the
      dev is still trying to make a full story and invest time to add new content.  It
      is still a bad game, but i cant say anymore, that this is the worst game on
      steam.



      Here is the full walkthrough for Episode 2:

      In the moment i wrote this update, the dlc is not included on this storepage.
