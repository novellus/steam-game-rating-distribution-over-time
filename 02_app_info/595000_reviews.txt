There is more visual polish here than in say, the VR spiderman games (though the Far From Home one has much more actual game than this) and it is pretty neat walking around the firehouse in VR. Slimer also looks great and I really liked the animated Ghostbusters logo who talks to you (sounded like Patton Oswalt but I'm not sure). Unfortunately part 2 kind of squanders this setup, but I would love to see a proper, full ghostbusters VR game with this level of Visual fidelity. I do actually like these little VR promos Sony does for their movies, but the price is a bit silly for the amount of content. Good way to kill 10 minutes though.","timestamp_created":1576407498,"timestamp_updated":1576407498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0a/NhO8Cec+95AE="}
