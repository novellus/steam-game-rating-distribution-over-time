    short_description: Derelict is a post-apocalyptic, top down, sandbox, rogue like(like).
      You have woken up from stasis long after the fall of humanity. Thousands of
      years of human colonization and war have left countless derelict space craft,
      abandoned space stations and settlements ripe for looting.

    review: "10/10, price is a bit high but its a low budget HeatSignature (the game\
      \ Tom Francis is working on, i recommend you check it out as well)\n\nanyway,\
      \ like SPAZ (NUMBER 1, NOT 2, ugh 2 is ... not my bag, Really weird SPAZ 2 that\
      \ is.) it offers frree space exploration, and choice to do what you would like\
      \ in a free roam environment.\n\nPros:\n1. GTA 2 like gameplay in the dark future\n\
      2. Space exploration\n3. free roam narrative (although lacking)\n\nCons: \n\
      1. barely any story\n2. price....9.99? for this? cmon. (that seems to be a bad\
      \ trend among indie developers, but I'm sure Valve recommended the price.. surely)\n\
      3. not enough tutorial, not enough guidance, and there really needs to be a\
      \ better sector map in these kinds of games. \n\n\n10/10 because we dont have\
      \ enough games like it, wish SPAZ 1 would have more games.\n\nEDIT: games is\
      \ still good. but man does it still need love. The concept is solid as fuck.\
      \ We really need more games like this. I swear Im addicted to SPAZ 1 type games.....\
      \ \nif you like this game check out games like CRYPTARK, Space Pirates and Zombies."
