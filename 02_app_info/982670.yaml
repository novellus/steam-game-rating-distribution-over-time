      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who are Clan N</h2><br>Clan N is an ancient samurai\
      \ group in the region of \u201CFar East\u201D, sworn to protect the realm from\
      \ all who seek its destruction. The four group members consist of the shinobigatana-wielding\
      \ ninja Akira, the staff-striking Reina, the dual sword-swinging Daiki, and\
      \ the sickle-slashing monk Tarou.<br><br>After years of training and dedication\
      \ to their respective craft, each character has uncovered their own unique magical\
      \ abilities. Akira shoots pulse-filled lightning bolts, Reina controls the ground\
      \ with vicious earthquake shocks, Daiki swirls up brutal tornado waves, and\
      \ Tarou can call for the help of Dragons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>Akuji\
      \ is a former samurai of the Clan N that discovered the balance of the world\
      \ lies in three areas: Peace, Knowledge, and Time. Akuji found that if you knock\
      \ the world of one of these, you can harness the powers of \u201Cspiritual imbalance\u201D\
      \ and grow stronger from it. As a result of pursuing spiritual imbalance, he\
      \ was shunned from the samurai temple and kicked out of Clan N.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/982670/extras/Akuji_Cropped.gif?t=1606036979\"\
      \ /><br><br>What Akuji didn\u2019t know was that attaining spiritual imbalance\
      \ would not only give you dark powers, it consumed your light and the purity\
      \ of your life. Following his banishment from the temple and Clan N, Akuji was\
      \ able to destroy peace by slaughtering villages and retain the power of those\
      \ he killed, thus absorbing conflict and electric sorcery abilities, becoming\
      \ the most powerful sorcerer warrior in the Far East. While he continued to\
      \ grow, Akuji formed Seishin Gun, the spirit group, to join his conquest and\
      \ remove anyone standing in their path.<br><br>Once his actions were discovered\
      \ by Clan N, they set on a journey to stop the villainous pillaging by Akuji\
      \ and Seishin Gun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Characters</h2><br>Reina and\
      \ Daiki grew as siblings in a southern samurai clan. Reina was not taught the\
      \ teaching of the clan like her brother Daiki but still observed and learned\
      \ the ways mastering the staff. She eventually took onto Shamanism as well becoming\
      \ one of the first shinobi shamans in the land as a young woman.<br><br>Akira\
      \ was a childhood friend adopted into the clan as a lost child wandering in\
      \ the outer lands chased by a pack of wolves, barely making it to the village.\
      \ Daiki\u2019s father took the child in and raised them, although Akira typically\
      \ covers himself from head to after severe scarring.<br><br>Tarou was from the\
      \ same monastery as Akuji (prior to his joining of Clan N) and learned under\
      \ the same teachers. Akuji returned to the Monk\u2019s temple many years later\
      \ and stole an ancient scroll that explained how to destroy the pillars of balance\
      \ and extract their spiritual imbalance. In pursuit of Akuji, Tarou traced his\
      \ steps to Clan N. After explaining the situation to the existing three members,\
      \ they all decided to team up and take down Akuji.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/982670/extras/FightLoop2_Cropped.gif?t=1606036979\"\
