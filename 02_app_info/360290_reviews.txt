Not least of all because it features a few familiar faces from that seminal doco and its multitude of extras (e.g. Edmund McMillen has a brief cameo, and Jason Rohrer is featured prominently).\n\n   A bit less of a \"Journey\" on this one, despite the game of the same name being prominently featured: more of a straight-down-the-line TV-style doco, with largely unrelated segments covering the development of different games. But close enough to a must-see for all aspiring indie devs, just the same. And the price is certainly nothing to scoff at.\n\n   So what are you waiting for? Buy it now! (Or rent, if you really must; though why anyone would bother is frankly beyond me, given it's more than half the price of buying it outright.)\n\n   Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)\n","timestamp_created":1587307113,"timestamp_updated":1587307113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5945853590965271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oo24yfECdMj+gQI="}
