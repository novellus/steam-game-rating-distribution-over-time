But this game appears to be made with a bunch of cookie-cutter characters, and frankly nothing is stopping you from running away from combat just to progress the story, and then ending up severely under-leveled to take on the next boss and then realize it's too late you cannot return to the previous area to train up. I thought this game was going to be more of an open-world where you would be free to explore the previous area after defeating a boss, but sadly that was not the case, and the quality of the game really isn't worth the price.\nIf the developers were to update the game and make some improvements i would be willing to try it out again.","timestamp_created":1582853337,"timestamp_updated":1582853337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+qXaxPACff789AE="}
