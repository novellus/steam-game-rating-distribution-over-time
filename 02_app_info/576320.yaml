    review: 'So, let me get this straight: A level 2 user half asses creating a game,
      sells it on steam, people buy it, it doesn''t work, he creates a new map for
      it, which also, doesn''t work, then the menu in game stops working, he then
      doesn''t post any updates for over two and a half years, and then just un-publishes
      the game and does not give refunds to the users who bought the broken thing
      in the first place. Steam, stop allowing random people to publish broken crap
      and then steal people''s money and not offer them refunds when it so clearly
      was a scam in the end.'
