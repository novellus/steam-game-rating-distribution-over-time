The game gives you some vibes of Max payne 1 except it has different environment and storyline. I really enjoyed the game, first 2 3 minutes i got annoyed by the graphics but after that I became used to. The gameplay and environment all looks awesome to me , definitely recommended. I played this game non stop for an hour without getting bored .","timestamp_created":1603211424,"timestamp_updated":1609361540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501034021377563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuojb2vYCdLCKqQI="}
