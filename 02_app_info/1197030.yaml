    review: "I'm quite disappointed in this game since it is claimed to be \"original\
      \ blend of intriguing puzzles and an immersive storyline set\" and I bought\
      \ it because of that, of this immersive storyline but in fact it's writing is\
      \ very bad :( Such a shame because I would really like to play some story game\
      \ in the ancient India setting.\n\nSo, pros:\n - Levels art\n - Takes couple\
      \ hours to get 100% completion\n\nCons:\n - Writing\n - Gameplay (while it is\
      \ not bad at all it is very monotonous; there is only one new mechanic which\
      \ is added somewhere at the middle of the game)\n - Cutscenes art\n - Sometimes\
      \ it hangs on opening new level"
