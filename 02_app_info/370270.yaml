    review: Vaprak threatens to defeat our world which is the last planet that stands
      between him and a dimensional vortex. This vortex leads to a fifth and, up until
      now, lost dimension. If he succeeds in defeating us, he will destroy our world,
      opening a gateway for his kind as well as the strange mutating effect that this
      dimension has on all organic life forms. His forces are far too strong for us
      to defeat in a frontal attack which is why I was sent to slip past his Omni-eye
      scanners and make an assassination attempt on the greatest evil that man has
      ever known. It will take absolutely all of my wits and skill but it is imperative
      that I reach his fortress and send him back to the sulfurous plane from whence
      he came.
