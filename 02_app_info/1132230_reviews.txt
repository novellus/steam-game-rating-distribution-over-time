It's pretty cool how well the music holds up. Asking price is stupid high, though; you can get comparable Sega Genesis classic games for <$2 normally.\nGet it if you're a fan and just want to throw money at Shin'En, or if it's very deep discount and you want to see what GBA could do with it's 17mhz processor and 400k of RAM.","timestamp_created":1606687064,"timestamp_updated":1606687064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/N+Ai/YCd/m+tQI="}
