    review: "[b] Target Audience:[/b] [I] 80s scifi fans who have a high frustration\
      \ tolerance and a willingness to accept defeat over and over and over again.[/i]\n\
      \n[b] First Impressions Video: https://youtu.be/K6GnhtuIPHs [/b]\n\n[u] Summary:\
      \ [/u]\nA game that wants to live in the 80s scifi lifestyle....and plays like\
      \ a game that may have been made in the 80s. The game strongest element is its\
      \ intriguing scifi storyline. While we've seen plots of government vs freedom\
      \ before, the addition of the personal element into it is well done here, and\
      \ it's not a simple good vs evil story line. The soundtrack complements this,\
      \ and presentation wise, the game does a reasonable job. It's the gameplay that\
      \ falls flat on its face. While you'd think it'd be straight forward, long lines\
      \ of sight added to some enemies that can snipe you from afar makes a deadly\
      \ combination that puts the frustration factor not only on high, but on infurating.\
      \ This on top of some poor level design decisions that don't complement the\
      \ gameplay in question either. See that's the key word in all this: Frustration.\
      \ It's a game that can't escape that frustration, whether it be a bad accuracy\
      \ system that goes against the small time to die game play, or literring the\
      \ floor with movable boxes that impedes the players progress, and blocks his\
      \ line of site. In the end, I all I wanted to do was walk away from the game,\
      \ never to look at it again. \n\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]My Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n\
      [*] The 80s story themes do pretty well overall, as it does remind me of good\
      \ government versus free will stories of the past. It's not just straight up\
      \ good versus evil, there's detail and nuasence added to this tale.\n[*] Sound\
      \ track is pretty rockin, with good electronic music that fits what the game\
      \ is going for in most cases. High action, and good fun all around.\n[*] For\
      \ the most part, the UI is clean and functional, minimal but giving you the\
      \ information that you need. \n[*] The ammo upgrade system is nice. \n[*] The\
      \ core gameplay rewards creative thinking, which is basically finding out how\
      \ to exploit the AI.\n[/list]\n\n[b] My Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Design,\
      \ Design, Design. There's a couple of mechanics that could work in this game,\
      \ but when they get combined together, it's a disaster.\n[*] Enemies have deadly\
      \ accuracy, even with weapons considered to be close range (shotgun). Best clip\
      \ is in the video where I walk through the door, and get blown away from an\
      \ enemy off screen in one shot. Speaking of....\n[*] The camera fights you as\
      \ you won't be able to see what you need to actually fight the enemies at times.\
      \ Combine that with some deadly accuracy, and you've got a situation where it's\
      \ just not fun to get your ass handed to you. Especially when....\n[*] The accuracy\
      \ stat on guns was a bad idea in a game with such a short time to die, especially\
      \ when enemies don't seem to be affected by it. \n[*] Why the shit on the ground.\
      \ It is one of the most annoying things in the fact that it can actually really\
      \ mess with the mechanics of battle. Why. Why do this. Especially when you can\
      \ actually hit that shit with your gun at times. \n[*] Game needed better level\
      \ design all around. While there's some variety, it doesn't play to the game\
      \ strengths, especially with long corridors, or some kill zones that you can't\
      \ avoid. \n[*] Having numbers for abilities at the bottom of the screen without\
      \ something relating the ability is an oversight.\n[*] The game lacks punch,\
      \ impact. Sometimes throwing a mine can get a cool rush of fun, but most of\
      \ the time, you're doing the same thing over and over again.\n[*] The AI is\
      \ pretty dumb at times. Once I figured out that you can melee around corners....yeah\
      \ the game became a bit easier. Not in a good way.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want\
      \ more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.\
