    developer_response: "Thank you for the review. \n\nTo reiterate, Ad Movere started\
      \ writing about two months into 2020, after that i had switched art styles as\
      \ i found an artist who could help. The rate I was getting art back was not\
      \ matching the speed I was programming, and as a result, as the release date\
      \ crept (which I couldn't move, due to Valve) I had to split the game into chapters.\
      \ The script for the other two are complete. But they will take a lot of time\
      \ to fully program and finish (as they are a lot longer) I do appreciate your\
      \ critiques and will put them to use. Thanks for your review.\n\nAs for the\
      \ price, the game was originally going to be free, but due to having other people\
      \ working on the game with me who required payment, I had to make it 3 dollars\
      \ to compensate. "

    review: "[h1] Ad Movere is a game that shouldn't have been released yet, and it\
      \ should have been much longer. [/h1]\n\nBefore I go in depth to how this has\
      \ turned out so far, here's a summary of what I feel if you are looking to buy\
      \ this. This game is unfinished, and has most of its story behind DLC that will\
      \ be released next year. If you really want to give this game a shot and enjoy\
      \ it, best wait as right now this game isn't even worth being installed on your\
      \ computer. The DLC promises a bigger narrative with more stuff happening but\
      \ since nothing really happens in the story right now, I don't feel that it\
      \ will be any longer than 20 minutes, which is not worth it.\n\nAlright so about\
      \ the game. It's story is really really small. It's a simple story about a introverted\
      \ collage student trying to... do something. See an issue here is that there\
      \ is no motive for the main character or the reader for one bit. The story also\
      \ doesn't dive deep enough for us as readers to understand what is the goal\
      \ of our protagonist. The store page says \"Can you guide an aspiring artist\
      \ to success?\" but nothing from the visuals shows that she is an artist. The\
      \ actual text from the story doesn't showcase that Ingrid (the main character)\
      \ is an artist either, other than the introduction in the beginning. From there,\
      \ Ingrid goes to class to scold her roommate, the professor asks one question,\
      \ and then they go to their dorm and dress up for some party. At the party,\
      \ there's some weird things going on which \"transports\" the character to different\
      \ timelines or something, one where the main character is married to someone\
      \ we just met in the story, one where there's a knife pulled on her, and then\
      \ the game ends right when Ingrid tries to ask the professor something. \n\n\
      This isn't complete or gripping at all because nobody can be invested when nothing\
      \ really happens. If this was slowed down to an hour nothing of the sort would\
      \ be happening, and even when it's sped up to 10 minutes, it doesn't feel like\
      \ anything has happened to the characters. The game considers its story gripping,\
      \ but it's only gripping because this 10 minute story ends on randomness, which\
      \ doesn't make it really gripping at all, just makes it feel uninspired. The\
      \ game also has diverging story lines, but they aren't really diverging since\
      \ the story ends the same way. This could be expanded on in the DLC.\n\nThe\
      \ game's soundtrack is highlighted, which while isn't bad, isn't anything that\
      \ stands out. It's your classic piano background melody that fits with what's\
      \ shown on the screen most of the time. It's not something I feel anyone will\
      \ go out of their way to listen to but it's not harmful in any way.\n\nI feel\
      \ in it's current state it's a hard pass, even if it was free. And when the\
      \ DLC comes out, I still don't think it's worth installing it, unless if the\
      \ story actually has depth. This is because the first impressions of this make\
      \ this feel like a demo for an engine, more than an actual story game. \n\n\
      [b]And that's probably my biggest issue[/b]. This game has potential, but it's\
      \ not doing anything with that. It tries to act like there's a ton here but\
      \ most of the screenshots on the store page show most of what you are going\
      \ to see. It relies on the possibility of future DLC as a way to hold people\
      \ over but nobody I feel will be biting their nails at what happens next. More\
      \ people seem interested if this game will even continue more than seeing where\
      \ the story will go. It's sad really, because I know how long this game took\
      \ to come out and how many people were dogging on the developer saying it will\
      \ never finish, but it's inexcusable as it's still not finished in it's current\
      \ state and they are charging 3$ for it."
