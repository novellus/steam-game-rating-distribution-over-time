Missing sprites (right in the beginning of the game), uninteresting and barely developed characters, wasted concept. Like Infinite Game Works Ep 0, it had a certain potential, but the execution of this project failed. It’s sad, the art style is lovely and the BGM is much better than the first game, and when things start to get somewhat interesting, it ends. Just like that. \n\nI don’t know if the developers still read reviews (probably not), but I really hope that they can start working on this project again. At least add just a bit more of content and finish the story. Leaving it in EA for almost a year without any news is a really mean thing to do to the players.\n\n2/10. Avoid these two games, even on sale.","timestamp_created":1473643707,"timestamp_updated":1473643707,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.715699136257171631","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4p8+AjtcCdPmVYQ=="}
