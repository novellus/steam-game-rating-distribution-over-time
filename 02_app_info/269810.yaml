    about_the_game: Spate is a surreal experience set in a world that seeks to draw
      the player into its reality. Spate is a dark, brooding, and beautifully crafted
      emotional journey that is seen through the eyes of a struggling addict.  Created
      by former Disney &amp; Jim Henson artist Eric Provan, this artistic game is
      a story about one man's struggle and descent into madness. Fueled by absinthe
      hallucinations and haunting memories, Spate delivers a deliciously eerie adventure
      as the main character deals with the tragic loss and grim reality of the death
      of his daughter.
