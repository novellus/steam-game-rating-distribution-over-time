    review: "I like many of the people here played the original gateway 1/2 on flash\
      \ when I was younger. those games definitely left an imprint on me. i think\
      \ the developer succeeded in creating a fun puzzle game with an interesting\
      \ story and uniquely unsettling atmosphere. I was looking forward to buying\
      \ this game, and while its not god awful its definitely disappointing.  The\
      \ puzzles and environments in the first game were varied and compelling. Here\
      \ they are extremely repetative. Its almost entirely consists of tile puzzles,\
      \ some of which barely even qualify as puzzles. To make matters worse, it hardly\
      \ relates at all to the original story. i thought that the second game concluded\
      \ nicely and was curious to see where the devs would take things from there.\
      \ well turns out it adds literally nothing except for the ending i guess (?)\
      \ which was honestly confusing as hell. maybe im just dumb but I really did\
      \ not understand any of it. the original two games are good but they were already\
      \ free, so youre paying $10 for a less than one hour game that is mostly bad\
      \ tile puzzles. \n\nOne other thing is that in gateway two theres this super\
      \ obnoxious and grating high pitch noise in some parts of the game. Wtf? its\
      \ remastered but evidently all they did was make it worse. these devs can do\
      \ better"
