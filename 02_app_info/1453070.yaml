    review: "If you've played the base game, it's basically more of that in all its\
      \ janky glory (though surprisingly somewhat less janky than the base game).\
      \ I played both in VR so can't speak to the PC/2D version. Just more of a cohesive\
      \ sequence. I played it all in one sitting, maybe an hour or so. Definitely\
      \ feels like a much shorter, very 'budget', VR version of Outlast 1. \n\nThe\
      \ jankiness makes it both more and less scary. Less cause it's easier to just\
      \ laugh it off, but also more cause in VR the sounds seem to come from everywhere\
      \ and nowhere at the same time. Lots of random women screaming that sounds very\
      \ close, but it's coming from inside walls/there's no one actually there. One\
      \ way to keep you on your toes I suppose. \n\n[spoiler] During the ending \"\
      boss fight\", just after you save the girl and go out to the front lawn, the\
      \ girl ended up straight up dying. You just have to spam the two bosses with\
      \ the taser until they go down, at first I wondered if I was doing it wrong.\
      \ Luckily the game didn't seem to give a shit that the entire thing was pointless\
      \ after her death and I \"won\" anyway. [/spoiler]"
