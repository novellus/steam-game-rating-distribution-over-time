      \ a lot of feedback on the lack of tutorials and that cause people don't know\
      \ how to play. We are working on that and also, improve some of the control\
      \ to make it more easy to play.\n\nAt the current state, we have a counter-attack\
      \ and we are working on dodging, and other active skills.\n\n\nIf you don't\
      \ mind. We would like to keep in touch and when we think the game can meet your\

      \ it again. \n\nThank you so much.\n"

    review: At the moment the game have no tutorial. The character's movement are
      buggy. No chance to dodge counter and so on. Keep on smashing the attack button.
      No way to counter enemies. Great potential poorly executed. I'll keep following
      but i have to refund it. Sorry
