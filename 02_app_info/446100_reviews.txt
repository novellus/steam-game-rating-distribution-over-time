After having it in my wishlist for several years, unsure, I finally bought it, hoping it would be some kind of great tribute to one of my favorite games, Fun Tracks / Ignition. Not only it is not that, but it is also a terrible game... Sorry for the devs, but that game is just bad: ugly UI and menus, mediocre tracks design, very poor music and sound design, terrible gameplay... A huge disappointment. The graphics are actually okay, the levels are even pretty! but the game is overall awfully repetitive and boring, it feels cheap and amateurish. Sadly, a forgettable game.\n\nJoin [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36483989-Hem-Watch/]Hem & Watch[/url][/b] live on [b][url=https://www.twitch.tv/hemandwatch]Twitch[/url][/b], [b][url=https://discord.gg/crnuted]Discord[/url][/b], and [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36483989/]Reviews[/url][/b]","timestamp_created":1607417819,"timestamp_updated":1607417819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4963koPYCd5GSuAI="}
