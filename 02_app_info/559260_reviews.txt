I stated that this could potentially be a masterpiece. I was right.\n\nMany of these negative reviewers choose to blame the game. They were broken down, and didn't stand back up. Nothing meaningful in life is obtained without struggle, and the beauty of this game cannot be appreciated without it.\n\nIt's a beauty that doesn't just reside in its gorgeous 16-bit pixel art out of the golden SNES era, atmospheric lighting, somber music, and creative enemy design. Or its story that is carefully fed to you in digestible bits instead of force-fed exposition dumps, memorable rare encounters that add more dimension to side characters, and world-building elements that allow players piece together themselves, if they so choose.\n\nIts a beauty that is within yourself.\n\nWhile the world-building is optional, piecing yourself back together is not. As you will be broken down and be forced to rebuild. You will write page after page of mental notes and will cherish your triumphs. Only to rip those notes in frustration and be reminded again that your best isn't good enough. But atop the mountain with rolling clouds stretching across the infinite horizon you will find something that cannot be experienced for you, because it is unique to you and only you. Yourself. Nothing meaningful in life is obtained without struggle, and the beauty of this game cannot be appreciated without it.\n\nFor every death comes a choice; to learn more of ourselves, or to lose more of ourselves.\n\n\nChoose.","timestamp_created":1604635957,"timestamp_updated":1609630849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/rLe4vYCdMLNrAI="}
