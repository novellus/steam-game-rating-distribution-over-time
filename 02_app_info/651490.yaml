    about_the_game: "Bo and Ao: two recent university graduates prepare to move out\
      \ of the flat they lived in together, over the past year. Both struggle to find\
      \ work and meaning in post-education life. Disillusioned with their time in\
      \ the UK and forced out of the country by a government who doesn\u2019t want\
      \ them there, Ao prepares to move back to Japan, leaving their friends and Bo\
      \ behind. Home seems like a difficult place to hold on to, and deep under their\
      \ South London flat, something grows...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;No Longer Home&quot;\
      \ is a semi-auto-biographical point and click game, set in a magical realist\
      \ world. Wander through an intimate flat, and examine the everyday belongings\
      \ of Bo and Ao. Delve into their thoughts and insights, and mould your interpretation\
      \ of the characters through branching, multiple-choice dialogue. Have BBQs,\
      \ play video games, and stay up late just talking in bed. It is made by a core\
      \ team of: Humble Grove (Hana Lee &amp; Cel Davison), Adrienne Lombardo and\
      \ Eli Rainsberry. As well as with the contributions of other artists and musicians."
