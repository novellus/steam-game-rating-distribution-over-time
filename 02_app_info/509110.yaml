      \ Igor Petrovi\u0107. With a soundtrack composed by Dario Male\u0161evi\u0107\
      . In this game, the player will have to dodge a constant barrage of spikes coming\
      \ from the side of the screen. Not only will the player have to evade the spikes\
      \ currently on the screen, but they will also need to keep an eye out on the\
      \ next wave of spikes and position themselves accordingly. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe longer the player manages to stay alive, the higher their end-score will\
      \ be, with difficulty gradually increasing as time passes. As the game progresses,\
      \ there will also be the chance of a box appearing. Boxes are the 'currency'\
      \ of the game - collecting enough of them allows the purchase of new skins and\
      \ themes, both mostly aesthetical features."
