I do think it is a shame that they modified the Gwent mechanics from the way they originally were in the Witcher 3, but even though I enjoyed the original Gwent mechanics a lot, the new version is fun too. \n\nMy main beef with this game is that, if you miss something, it is kind of tricky to go back and undo your choices, so if you are a completionist, I recommend reading a guide before you act.","timestamp_created":1609907457,"timestamp_updated":1609907457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vsn96vYCev/zwAI="}
