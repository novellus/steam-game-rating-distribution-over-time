Snarset, which is a smaller Vibeke, despite that it trades the Cod/Pollock quota for the other two. (120 tons for redfish!)\nThe Drawback?\nIt's double the price of a Vibeke.\nNOT WORTH.\n\nThen the big old one all the way to the right, that's Moby D, it's Follabuen on steroids.\nIt's slower than a snail with alzheimers (lower than 5 knots when full), costs 3,350,000kr, sounds awful right? You'd think you would never make money with this, well oh boy.\nCapable of carrying 10,000 hook longlines, and with a massive storage (50 tons on purchase, can be upgraded to 100 tons!)\nThis behemoth can carry immense hauls, outrivaled only by trawlers, easily earning you 7 digit numbers in currency,\nWORTH.\n\nIn Short, the modern boats are trash, settle for ol'reliable.","timestamp_created":1603447693,"timestamp_updated":1603447971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y8u8qvUCfrXKqQI="}
