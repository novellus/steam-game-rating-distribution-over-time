    about_the_game: <i>Garrison Gauntlet</i> is an oldschool-style action-platformer
      where you play through over four stages of intense challenges! A little robot
      that is to serve as nothing more than as one of the many robotic minions owned
      by the evil tyrant, Garrison, it realizes that being in such a position is no
      rewarding task. As the robot itself, you must stop Garrison's forces from the
      inside before they take over the world! <br><br>Play through the levels in any
      order you wish. Venture through the Sky Base, Disco Palace, and Underground
      Lair before finishing the job off in the treacherous Garrison Fortress! The
      destinations aren't easy to take on, and the enemies that lie within won't hold
      back.
