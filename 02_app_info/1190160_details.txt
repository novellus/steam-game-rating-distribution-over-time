We are 4 students from Berlin that just released their first indie game! We spent our spare time for the last 2 years for that and we are really happy to finally publish it on Steam :-).<br><br>We just want to let you know, that we still work on the game, if you detect anything not working. If you're having any problems while playing, please check the area below or let us know in the community hub.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Copperglass (Malte, Karolina, Julian, Carolin)<br><br><br>------------------------------<br><br><br><strong>Known issues<\/strong><br><br><i>&quot;Game gets stuck after completing all levels&quot;<\/i><br><br>If you started playing before an update came out, you may encounter this bug.

That said, the amazing light paths you are going to build in LIT are possible but extremely hard to reproduce in real life. Our game gives you the opportunity to set up mirrors and glass pieces to reflect and refract a light beam as you wish, with just few clicks of the mouse.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1190160\/extras\/yourSolutionENG.png?t=1591534609\" \/><br>Our puzzles are open-ended.
