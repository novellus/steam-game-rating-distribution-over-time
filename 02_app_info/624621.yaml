    review: 'This one is actually pretty good, the best of all 3 expansions, although
      it''s the winner in "which one is least disgusting" category.


      Our protagonist is a former spy, which now struggles with depression and alcoholism(even
      collectibles represent that). She''s not a cheesy `murican patriot, but is actually
      a believable person, with a personal revenge mission.


      And, as a bonus, not many assets were reused for this one, not bad.'
