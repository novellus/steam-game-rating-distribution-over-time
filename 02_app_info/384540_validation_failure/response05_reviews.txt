There was indeed a folder with some drawings, some ideas he had put on PDF docs etc, but still absolutely no video at all.  The video link above shows a video I made which I edited to show everything this content had just a few hours after my first video showed only the TEXT document.  I deleted my first video as soon as I dsocovered where and how to access that folder which was named 'Serial Jäsøn\" and why I didn't see it when I had looked the first time.\n\nRegardless, this guy had far too little content to sell it in early access, really nothing but notes and ideas of how his first few episodes might go, nothing of any real value to an average consumer wanting to see his videos he was advertising.  All the extra PDFs and ideas and sketches and ideas for his episodes are nice to have for some people but it's like the ketchup you put on a hamburger, when people are really hungry for the actual hamburger itself.\n\nFrom my understanding, Steam doesn't even allow products (games or videos) to be sold in early access with nothing but promises of content to come in the future.  There has to be some decent amount of actual game content for a game meaning a playable game -OR- some amount of actual video for a video series like this.\n\nAt this point however, the developer reacted like a child, lashing out deleting all threads on his community hub including a thread talking about the refund policy started by a Valve employee!  He has also at this point thrown more then 12 hours of temper tantrums in the comments under my reivew here, calling me and other people vulgar names, calling them idiots, trolls, etc etc.  He needs to take this as a learning lesson and realize that he should have put up at least a menu system with his early access launch that would allow a purchaser to easily access all of his PDF files and content without having to look through their computer hard drive to find such a folder.  Most Steam users know how to install an application okay, but don't know how to access and open these kind of folders, especially when the developer has NOTHING anywhere about it or how to access it anywhere in his forum or early access description.\n\nMy biggest concern for this product is not the product itself, it's the behavior of the developer after my single and only review was made here on Steam.  He has not done anything except throw insults, make excuses, and contradict himself over and over in the comments below such as in this comment http://i.imgur.com/Y0h0bhd.png\n\nOnce and IF this developer can stop blaming me and others for his failure to provide a good value, then I will be more then happy to re-review his content when he actually can provide the videos he is advertising here.  ..Until then, I am happy that Steam has listened to my request for them to take a look at his early access product and then removed it and his ability to sell nothing more then just promises of videos sometime in the future.  (When I requested a refund on this purchase, I contacted Steam and asked that they review his early access product and make sure it meets their rules of what can and can't be sold in early access).  Speaking of that, that is another big contradiction made in the comments below from this developer.  In some posts, he claims that HE took it down and made that request for Steam to take it down, but in his very first post he ever made below, he posted this.. http://postimg.org/image/ewnpp34ov/.\n\nRight now, the comments section from my review is still blowing up, almost 24 hours after it was written with just about 200 comments down, there, and about 25% of those I think are the developer for this product continuing to throw his temper tantrums, insults, and anger at myself and anyone else who dares to ask him a logical question or give him an understandable concern.  \n\nI highly suspect that the entertainment you might get from reading through the comments below this review will be much higher then what you would ever get watching his videos even if and when they ever get completed.  And the cost is \"FREE\"  :-)   ..Enjoy!\n\nHere is a couple of more videos I uploaded in direct response to the developers actions after my initial review by the way:\n\nMy Rant Against This Developer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E665hwWXDQg\n\nMy Rejoice Video When Steam Shut Down the Sales of His Early Access Sales Only Selling PDFs Ideas and Promises With No Video Content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0HqVDyGW_M","timestamp_created":1446462215,"timestamp_updated":1446570204,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":226,"votes_funny":27,"weighted_vote_score":"0.881715059280395508","comment_count":208,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwtrOT59ACcfHsRw=="}
