Have the Garden Rescue as well. Have almost 300 hrs on this one. Shoot bugs out of the air with corn shooters, burn bugs with the flaming bell peppers and tons of other ingenious methods, all in order to protect your Christmas trees! Easy and hard levels. It's cute and crazy for kids and adults. Good music too. Really hope that they develop another version. Highly recommend for casual gaming.","timestamp_created":1545956033,"timestamp_updated":1545956033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nqCK+ecCebnTtgE="}
