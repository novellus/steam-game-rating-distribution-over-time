Which is [i]quadruply[/i] insulting at the preposterous price of four frigging dollars, let's face it.\n\n   I was frankly relieved when the fourth wave spawned a new enemy type that was frozen in mid-air and utterly impervious to damage, thereby rendering the wave incompletable. WHAT. A. FREAKING. SHAME.\n\n   Verdict: 3/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1540652968,"timestamp_updated":1566061039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557364106178283691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42eGg0OwCcLW4rQE="}
