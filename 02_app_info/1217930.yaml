    about_the_game: "Physics-based VR with full freedom of flight.  VR that feels\
      \ and controls like a real jetpack.  A real-time multiplayer VR arena.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nPlayers can fly and interact with each other online in VR with realistic\
      \ physics-based controls. The controls are completely VR and natural, just as\
      \ you would use thruster controllers for a real jetpack (look up Jetman as an\
      \ example).  It's truly free range of motion and natural movement, not the teleport\
      \ or D-pad controls of most VR games.  This includes but is not limited to being\
      \ able to hover, drift, spin, flip, and burst through the sky without ever hitting\
      \ any special buttons (all controller angle/position based).  It's up to your\
      \ own imagination what combination of moves or positions you might be able to\
      \ do in the air.  You can even now swing and do hookshots with the new grappling\
      \ cables.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote that this means you can and will go upside-down.\
      \  Like with roller coasters, skydiving, or any other real-life thrill or extreme\
      \ sport, this experience is not for everyone, but for the right people, this\
      \ comes very close to feeling like flying (and swinging) in real-life.  If you\
      \ can't tolerate skydiving or going upside-down in real life, don't play.  Treat\
      \ this like an actual new sport or vehicle and not just a viewing experience\
      \ from home. Don't play if you just want something quick under 5 minutes.  Think\
      \ of how long it takes to learn to bike, ski, or other sports.  It's no different\
      \ here.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you first start out, spread your arms out\
      \ like you're balancing and keep the controllers upright.  The farther your\
      \ arms are out to the sides, the slower and more stable you are.  Tap each one\
      \ of the thrusters individually first (thumb press).  The thrust comes from\
      \ under each controller based on the angle you hold the controllers.  Don't\
      \ point forward or down to go.  Don't let your arms stick out in front.  There\
      \ are graphics and videos at the start, so pay close attention to those.  When\
      \ you've gotten good enough control to hover, you can bring the controllers\
      \ closer together for more speed.  Tapping both thrusters at the same time while\
      \ held close together will also let you go sonic speed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The game is currently being released as Early Access, as the core mechanics\
      \ and flying functionality along with multiplayer have been done for over a\
      \ year now.  The slowest part of development, and what is taking the most time\
      \ for me as a 1-man team, is the more traditional parts of the game, such as\
      \ map building, graphics, and other assets. I'm hoping that, as the game builds\
      \ interest, perhaps I will be able to get help working on these other more time-intensive\
      \ parts of the game.  Of interest to me is if players are willing to create\
      \ and share their own maps for others to fly and experience, as well as sharing\
      \ skins/mods for the appearances of the actual player.  If anyone is interested\
      \ in helping work on these items, feel free to reach out on the VR Jetpack Game\
      \ website."

      Broadcast and Twitch. More options like player stats on the official site.<br>-
      Ladder rankings for the Zero-G arena are on the VR Jetpack Game website (link
      on side).<br>- The jetpack controls are designed to be realistic with the thrust
      coming from below the controllers.  Do not point to go.  See the following real-life
      jetpack (Jetman), which has the same control scheme. Everything is designed
      to feel real, so if you don't like upside-down rollercoasters or skydiving in
      real life, don't play.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj-Iwv5NJKg"
