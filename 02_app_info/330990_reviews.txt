On one hand, I got it at 90% off. On the other, the game itself was quite tedious and didn't live up to Artifex Mundi's standard. This game is older and it really shows. I found myself getting bored playing it. However, although the main story wasn't as fun, the bonus story was a little better, certainly prettier than the main game at least. I'd say to only get this one if it's on sale or perhaps if you intend on playing the whole Demon Hunter Series. Or if you really like hidden object puzzles, since there were so many of them in it.","timestamp_created":1609286985,"timestamp_updated":1609288663,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/YfF2PYCcsPOvgI="}
