Too many chess games are a boring take on the same old game but this is exactly what I want! I frankly dislike chess because it bores me. This variant offers all the things I feel are lacking in generic chess games, puzzle, tactics, RPG like mystery & something of a progressive challenge. For the price of the game I cannot recommend this highly enough!","timestamp_created":1609127910,"timestamp_updated":1609127910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp+vf0/YCdcn9vQI="}
