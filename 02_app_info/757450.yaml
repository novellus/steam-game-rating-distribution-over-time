    review: I have to say that I did enjoy the first book very much and rode the fond
      memories of the first book into the adequate second book. But this third book
      was a pain to play through. There were moments of good chapters, but overall,
      I was left confused and bored from the new sleuthing play style. The thing that
      bothered me the most however, was the randomness I felt that came from the choices
      that would rapidly decrease attunement. Half way through the book I resigned
      myself to this unforgiving mechanism that was punishing to play through. I forced
      myself to to make uncertain choices for the sole purpose of finding how the
      plot moves forward in book 4. Disappointing to say the least.
