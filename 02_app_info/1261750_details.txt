Oblivious to the rising epidemic, he innocently wonders around the apartment and comes across Frank…who is eating his wife. Andrew, horrified of the man-eating Frank, is stunned as Frank lunges at him with great force. Andrew takes out his knife and ends Franks life. His own guilt of killing his friend leaves him shocked. With what he knows now, he tries to escape his apartment that is now filled with man-eating humans. Could this be Em-A-Li’s doing? She is an A.I, new to the human world, that has been looking for Stu since her last encounter with him. Where is Stu now?
