The little quality of life things that separate a professional game from a hobby game is the little quality of life touches that this one has. The different ways you can play the game, the resolutions, saving, and level design all feel like they are meant to work that way. \n\nThe level design is very clever; that every time you die you are just that much closer to the end goal because you have your newest upgrade or ability. The damage you take is not nearly punishing enough to become frustrating, giving you ample opportunities to correct yourself and take your time. \n\nSome cons:\nEnemy behavior is a bit erratic, leaving them trapped smacking into one another and blocking off sections which seems unintentional. \n\nThe sense of direction seems generally clear, but its hard to distinguish what ability helps you get to what new area. You never really get the \"aha!\" moment when you find a new item, because there's no way to know if it actually works in this new way or not. \n\nOverall, obviously this was very polished and very well executed. If you're a fan of challenging platformers, this is definitely up your alley. Every little detail you come to expect from a good game is present, and I hope to see more from CoolJosh3k in the future!","timestamp_created":1597798142,"timestamp_updated":1597798142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg5qMgvQCd9+pnAI="}
