Got it on sale for $2 and that wasn't too bad for something a bit different, though barely so.  Somewhat similar to Regenesis Arcade.\n\nThe biggest con is there is no state save of level or weapons upgrades so you have to start from scratch at level 1 each time you open the game.  And it crashed on me @ level 13 or 14.\n\nUnlike many wave shooters, this has some teleport free movement with rotation on teleport.  No free rotation though.  A 45 or 90 degree rotate on the right stick would have been helpful.\n\n5 weapons: pistol (forced starting purchase), shotgun, rifle, grenade launcher, and rocket launcher.  Each play differently and you can dual wield 2 different weapons (not the same one).  You don't get damaged by your own explosions and the overall \"VR presence\" of the weapons is a bit weak.  The mechanics basically make the pistol a weak rifle and the shotgun and grenade a weak rocket.  So I played with rifle as my primary and rocket in my off-hand since it has pretty good area of effect.  Sometimes use the rifle to finish off enemies weakened by the rocket.\n\nYou're ammo limited in both current mag and total ammo.  But full ammo reload drops a couple times a wave.  Doesn't refill the current mag though.  And there's no manual reload.  \"firing\" when the mag runs out reloads which takes 1-2 seconds depending on upgrades.\n\nKilling enemies earns in game currency.  Good variety of weapon purchases and upgrades.  You can purchase during the 1 minute cooldown (which can be skipped if you want) and even during the waves though it's tricky to drop gun, fiddle with armory, and pick gun back up during a fight.  Upgrades incl: damage, fire rate, reload rate, mag capacity and total ammo capacity, as well a \"critical hit\" chance and bonus, burst mode, might have forgotten a couple.","timestamp_created":1546155967,"timestamp_updated":1546155967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ofiE/+cCftL0tgE="}
