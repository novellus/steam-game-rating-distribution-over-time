Disturbed is a great horror, choose your own adventure like game. Let’s get into the story.\n\nA farmer whose crops and cow have mysteriously contracted a plague that's killing them, his only hope to save his dying land is to travel and find out what is the cause of this plague. \nSo what’s the likes. The game has a good creepy atmosphere as you travel through a medieval land. The new art is very good even better than the old art. The story is good as you find out what caused the strange plague, I also like the choose-your-own-adventure feel to the whole game.\n\nThe deaths you can get can range from funny or very scary, mostly scary. The game’s music and sound is good I like how they added some more sound to it witch I liked. \n\nThe levels are nice to explore and there are some parts where I just stopped and marveled at it.\n\nSo what’s the Dislikes. The new death where if you take too much time in the game a ghost kills you was kind of dumb luckily I didn't have to deal with it because I found a charm early on in the game that protected me, but still that new death was dumb.\n\nThe tree puzzle can be annoying and the cave that was under the tree can also be kind of annoying but they're both not too bad.\n\nSo all in all Disturbed is a great horror, choose your own adventure like game. With a good creepy atmosphere, nice levels and many great deaths to get.\n\nSo if you’re looking for choose your own horror adventure game, this game is for you and I cannot wait to play the sequel.  I all so say get the DLC it doesn't really do anything but its $0.99 and it will help support the maker of this game.","timestamp_created":1497902211,"timestamp_updated":1607525347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ468X+o/YCcMWhfA=="}
