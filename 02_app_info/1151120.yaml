    review: Despite the great art style, this game is pretty slow and pretty broken.
      Despite what a lot of reviewers are saying on here, the gun play is actually
      ridiculously easy once you realize how broken it is. I posted a video of me
      going through a level of the game to exemplify this in the discussion section
      for this game, but essentially you can beat the whole thing without dying by
      just walking forward and shooting and occasionally grabbing a gun from an enemy
      behind you. This is because there's a bug where enemies behind you can only
      hit you with their bullets if they are super close to you. Outside of this,
      the story is pretty bland and not very involved. You can participate in a few
      activities around the city of Paris when youre not going through mission levels,
      but none of them are really interactive in any way - even going to the movies
      is just you watching your character sit in a chair.  I understand that there
      is supposed to be an underlying theme of ennui and nihilism running through
      everything, but without compelling gameplay to back the theme, it ends up just
      feeling like a bit of a slog. I still plan on finishing the game since I purchased
      it and want to get my money's worth, but, as of now, I honestly don't know if
      I can recommend this to anyone.
