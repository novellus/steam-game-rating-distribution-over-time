I'm also not a huge football fan, but picked this one up on a whim.\n\nI enjoyed goofing around with it a bit. It's easy to play but probably difficult to master as there are multiple levels of strategy that go beyond mere play calling. You can play solo, but it's probably best enjoyed head-to-head (it's supposed to support online friends play, but I didn't test this).\n\nThe production values are great, with a clean, consistent and visually appealing art style on the cards, crisp animation throughout, and a cheery sound library that fits the cartoony look. I especially liked the little touch of the players behaving like billiard balls during play action. My only gripe here would be that it's often hard to see exactly who has the ball and where they're going.\n\nIt's evident that a lot of care and attention to detail went into making this game, something that is often lacking on \"Indie\" releases. If you're on the fence about buying this one, I would encourage you to do so for no other reason than to support a developer who obviously cares about quality.","timestamp_created":1562321158,"timestamp_updated":1562321158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542168676853179932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw95/m4OsCeqjPzAE="}
