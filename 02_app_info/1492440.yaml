    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Zero-Point is a 3D space roguelike
      inspired by the indie hit FTL: Faster Than Light.</strong></h2><br><br>With
      the fate of Earth resting in your hands, you''ll embark on a dangerous mission
      to save the Star Federation and face down the rebellion known as the Galactic
      Liberation Front!<br><br>Zero-Point is currently in the development stage, and
      will include 6-7 races, around 50 different ships, 20-30 different level backgrounds
      and a wide variety of weapons. There will also be a full immersive soundtrack,
      as well as many engaging event scenarios and voice acting for ship crews.<br>It''ll
      be a relatively high difficulty roguelike that rewards repeat play and encourages
      players to learn from their mistakes.<br><br>One of the things we want to include
      in the game is an immersive 3D look at the interior of the player''s ship. You
      can see some preliminary interiors in the trailer. Players will be able to see
      their ship''s corridors, crew, room damage and more as each battle and scenario
      unfolds.<br><br>Combat will be realtime and will see ships facing off with an
      arsenal of weapons ranging from beams to lasers, torpedoes and more. Similarly
      to FTL, there will also be random events in each sector of space that the player
      visits, such as the example shown in the video where a merchant ship outfits
      the player''s vessel with torpedoes.<br><br>Our art style for Zero-Point is
      semi-toony, bringing the simple graphical style of the original FTL formula
      to life in a 3D game world in a way that hopefully excites and creates keen
      interest among fans.<br><br>Our co-director is a big fan of FTL and passionate
      about the genre (he''s beaten the original with every layout of every ship)
      and we''re super excited about this project to bring Zero-Point to life!'
