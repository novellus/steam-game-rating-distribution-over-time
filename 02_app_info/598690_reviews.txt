The graphics look kind of unfinished, some nice looking objects but terrible terrain textures.\nSame for stability, it runs smooth but crash on every level load.\nThe devs abandon it, same should the customer do. Just look for alternatives.\n\nP.S. Fun Fact, without any noteable development since ages, this game still shows 'early version'. Steam should force a status abandoned or finished if there is no dev showing up once every 3 month.","timestamp_created":1577876834,"timestamp_updated":1577876947,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4g/CysO8Ccvzx6AE="}
