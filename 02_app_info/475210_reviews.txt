There are no further file Formats available and there is also no Album artwork.\n\n[b]The tracks I liked the most:[/b]\n\n[i]Merrow Ruins[/i] & [i]Undying Caves[/i] - Also the main theme of the Game is too well written Merrow Ruins & Undying Caves easily topped it. Merrow Ruins is easy and playful, Undying Caves the complete contrast to it. \nSlow, deep and depressive while at the same time beautiful. Those two songs fit so often 100% in the Game in the mood of the Game that many times when i was playing the Game I stoppd my submarine right in the middle of the ocean and just listen to those two tracks while at the same time the waves were crushing against the walls of my submnarine.\n\n[b]The tracks I like the least:[/b]\n\n[i]The Watcher (Ancient Spider)[/i] - Not because the track is bad or worse but because I remember doing that boss fight over and over again because of a Bug in the Game so that in the end I was so burned out because of those hundreds retries that I got sick of that track in the end.\n\nI got the Song of the Deep Soundtrack during the Halloween Sale for less then one Dollar which is clearly way below what the Soundtrack is worth in the long run.\n\nIt was worth it. I already enjoyed playing Song of the Deep a lot even back then while it was still full of Bugs and Glitches but I just kept playing since I liked the Game and the Soundtrack back then as much as I still do nowadays.\n\nWell done Insomniac Games & Jonathan Wandag\n\n[i][b]Thumbs Up[/b][/i]\n\nThatÂ´s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-)","timestamp_created":1509267202,"timestamp_updated":1509267268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609120488166809082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmtzVs98CdP3ciQE="}
