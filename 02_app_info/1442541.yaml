    about_the_game: "Pamali Original Soundtrack Album features folk songs originally\
      \ from Indonesia that are recomposed with horror elements to support the horror\
      \ atmosphere inside the game.<br><br>The White Lady\u2019s soundtrack is <strong>Nina\
      \ Bobo</strong>, a lullaby song that is usually sung by a mother. It fits the\
      \ lore behind The White Lady game since the game tells the story of a mother\
      \ who loses a child.<br><br><strong>Eling-Eling</strong>, The Tied Corpse\u2019\
      s soundtrack is a folk song that is usually sung by children in a religious\
      \ school as a reminder that we need to do good deeds when we\u2019re still alive\
      \ because death is scary and painful. The only regret will come later, and it\
      \ fits the story of Pocong in The Tied Corpse who led his life badly before.<br><br><strong>Gundul\
      \ Pacul</strong>, is a folk song originally from Central Java, the area of The\
      \ Little Devil sets, tells what it means to be a good leader. Karsono, Putri\u2019\
      s late grandfather who previously owned a Tuyul, does not meet the requirement\
      \ of a good leader.<br><br><strong>Bibi Rangda</strong>, a folk song originally\
      \ from Bali island, tells a story of a Rangda who is holding a baby after bringing\
      \ the baby back to life from the grave. This song shows how much a mother loves\
      \ her baby deeply, even turning the scary-looking Rangda, the queen of Leak,\
      \ into a very loving mother once she holds a baby.<br><br><strong>Gending Rana</strong>,\
      \ a soundtrack for battle scenes in The Hungry Witch, is an arrangement of Bibi\
      \ Rangda folk song, which is arranged with traditional Balinese gamelan to enhance\
      \ the feel of being trapped in a tense and stressful situation in the battle\
      \ against the Evil.<br><br>The folk songs that are chosen to be the original\
      \ soundtrack in every episode of Pamali: Indonesian Horror Game, were recomposed\
      \ by adding Pamali\u2019s flavor that is creepy, yet still holding into the\
      \ traditional music from Indonesia."
