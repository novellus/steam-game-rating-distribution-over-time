The aim of the game is to lower yourself down towards the surface of the planet, land on one of the randomly generated platforms, pick up inhabitants and fly back up towards the the space craft. All the while avoiding both static and moving space objects which will damage your shield and eventually cause you to explode and start again.\n\nYou begin tethered to the ship, swinging left and right, but will detach when you are low enough down.  You will need to adjust your speed and angle of descent skillfully to make it to the platforms. A high level of precision is required to land successfully. Adding to the challenge is limited fuel - leaving not too much room for repeated adjustments of speed and angle of landing. \n\nUpon landing, one of the little fellas will run towards your ship, and you will gain bonus fuel. This is not just to fly back up to the ship, but also to attempt to rescue additional dwellers by landing on the other platforms. These will give bonus points at the end of the level. You can also get points bonus for zero damage.\n\nEach level adds more and more objects - you need patience, accuracy and just a bit of luck too sometimes to complete later levels.\n\nI heartily recommend this game, because it's challenging, nostalgia-inducing, with nice Jean-Michel Jarre-like synth sounds and effects, and gives a high level of self satisfaction completing the ever more difficult levels. A steal at 99 cents!","timestamp_created":1601150141,"timestamp_updated":1601150141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pIj/5fQCc8qipAI="}
