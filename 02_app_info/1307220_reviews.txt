Ball is hard to throw, since it seems to stick in place sometimes when you throw/release grip.  Uses plenty of apparently stock assets and music.  I'd be more interested in this game if it had multiplayer and if it were more developed. Concept is cool, but the game needs more work.","timestamp_created":1603947636,"timestamp_updated":1603947636,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tSuufUCcsHjqgI="}
