      \ from the frequency of such news on the mass media. By walking the user through\
      \ hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in photorealistic CGI scenes, the creator\
      \ Ali Eslami aims to inspire an active awareness towards big data that represents\
      \ massive deaths, and compassion for the people behind those numbers.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nOn the basis of a virtual journey through the history of European\
      \ bloodbaths, an ocean filled with body bags containing recently drowned Syrian\
      \ refugees, and casualties of the Syrian civil war, DeathTolls Experience immerses\
      \ us in the meaning of these figures, opening up an emotional perspective on\
