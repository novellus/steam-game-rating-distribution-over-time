Sort of an action RPG of sorts but I didn’t get far enough to say any more.\n\nI had the usual 4k monitor problems. Game runs at 3840x2160 looks nice enough, except the interface is so small as to be unreadable. Positively microscopic. So back to 1920x1080 we go. It was written in 2015 after all.\n\nGameplay feels a bit clunky, character movement especially. R-Click, R-Click, R-Click, R-Click, and R-Click, again.\n\nIn my 1 hour gametime, I had one crash to desktop. Playing on Normal I couldn’t get past the first “mission” or very early combat where you face 4 enemies. Tried twice. There is no AutoSave so you have to start at very beginning.\n\nLike so many people have said it’s a shame Steam don’t have a Neutral vote. But they don’t so im saying this game is worth a 49% meaning it just about gets the thumbs down.\n\nSome games hook you in and you can’t wait for more, im afraid this one didn’t. Hour 2,3,4,5 might be amazing but if you aren’t hooked in the first hour your never gonna see it. I  wonder if this was the devs first game, and if it was they did very well, but its not quite there.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1606768994,"timestamp_updated":1606768994,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7aS5jfYCec+GtgI="}
