Tutorial?  In English?  Without it sounding like a Commisar is screaming in your ear with a megaphone?    I gave it 30 mins and still couldn't figure out what to do.  The 1st game of my 290 games on Steam to leave me saying \"WTF?\"   I can't believe Steam released this, even in Early Access.

In the menu there is a button \"training\".\nThe game of military style because of this all unit voices with the \"radio\" effect.\nAnd it is worth adding that 30 minutes is too short to at least get trained.\n\nAlso you could ask me that you do not understand something, i open to community.\n\nWell, the product is updated regularly and you have in vain abandoned it ahead of time.\n"}],"cursor":"AoJwzJz/gOoCdrP0vgE="}
