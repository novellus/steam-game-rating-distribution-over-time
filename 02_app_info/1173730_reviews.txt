I've played the early access version 0.0.1, so it has been impossible to expect contents on contents, but for the minutes that I've spent, I enjoyed it.

A good start in my opinion, I'll keep an eye on the next updates.","timestamp_created":1609191522,"timestamp_updated":1609191522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw7b/S1fYCdLuevgI="}
