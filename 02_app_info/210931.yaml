    about_the_game: Few know Ashley Harding is the daughter of Benny the Diamond,
      the East End's most feared underworld boss. But rather than embrace a life of
      lawlessness and wealth, Harding chose to follow her dream of becoming an officer
      in the British Army. After years earning the grudging respect of her male peers,
      Harding finally made captain - just as the Horzine nightmare erupted to destroy
      her ambitions, drowning Harding's elite military unit in blood and madness.
      Now Ash is a one-woman army driven by the need to push back the darkness and
      tear evil a new one.
