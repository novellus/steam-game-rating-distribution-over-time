This will be a short review for the Cosmetic DLC “Seal of Inquisition Footprints” which is well, exactly what it sounds like.  You leave footprints that are shaped like glowing I’s (the symbol of the most holy Imperial Inquisition).\n\nHappy Feet:  I am torn with this DLC as it is only $2 and I like to support developers, not to mention there is never enough cosmetics in any game as you will be looking at the same character (more or less) for possibly a hundred hours.  But, it is $2 for something purely cosmetic and provides very little to the game outside of fun immersion (which might be enough as it is).  It would have been nice if this included a mission to unlock it, something narrative maybe?  And a minor buff would give a reason to choose between other cosmetics.\n\nAfter thinking I’ll say this, if you enjoy cosmetics then I’d recommend otherwise I’d wait for a sale, they happen fairly often and grab it with a bundle.  Enjoy!","timestamp_created":1590259317,"timestamp_updated":1590295745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nurAovICcZLoiQI="}
