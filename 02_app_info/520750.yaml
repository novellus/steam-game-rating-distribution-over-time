    review: "You don't feel like an action hero.  This game is not like Doom.  It's\
      \ not Dark Souls.  It's just another wave shooter with decent sized environments\
      \ that allow you to teleport or almost full trackpad locomotion with snap turning.\
      \  It's on sale now for $8.99, is there enough here to recommend at the sale\
      \ price?  Short answer, no.  \n\n[B][U] PROS [/U][/B]\n\n+ nice, large, detailed\
      \ environments\n+ easy, normal, hard don't just add more enemies, they add different\
      \ ones\n+ weapons do different things: melee, ranged, AOE\n+ enemies do different\
      \ things: melee, ranged, AOE\n+ mini-bosses and bosses\n\n[B][U] CONS [/U][/B]\n\
      \n- bugs, after dying I coudn't select any weapon and had to die\n- no story\n\
      - i had trouble with hit detection on sword, many times I swung and nothing\
      \ happened\n- so you're supposed to be this action-hero, but usually you'll\
      \ just be hiding behind cover and just finding that one spot in the map that\
      \ makes it easy to snipe enemies \n- dumb AI for the most part, why do ranged\
      \ enemies run towards you instead of looking for cover and trying to snipe you?\n\
      - drones in medium difficulty in this fantasy setting?  WTF?\n- melee can kill\
      \ anything just by swinging at them, shields of enemies do nothing, no parrying,\
      \ no strategy .. when it works with the mysterious hitboxes of enemies\n\nI\
      \ just think the negatives outweight the positives.  I wanted to like this game.\
      \  I was looking forward to a wave shooter where you can move around.  But there's\
      \ just really no strategy other than find the best sniping spot.  Even the boss\
      \ fights were not thrilling because of the clunkiness of combat.\n\nRating 4.5/10\
      \ can't recommend at sale price of $8.99, currently it's more of a $5 game if\
      \ that, feels EA, not 1.0"
