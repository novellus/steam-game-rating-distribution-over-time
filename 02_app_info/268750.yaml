    about_the_game: Explore, craft, and survive in this Multiplayer RPG Platformer
      with permanent death! Featuring many Rogue-like elements, Magicite randomly
      generates each underground dungeon for you and your friends to delve deep into.
      Chop trees, mine ores, and hunt beasts in order to collect the resources and
      materials you need to survive the harsh and unforgiving environment. With a
      ton of character traits, stats, companions, and classes, players will have a
      different experience each play through! Be prepared to die... A LOT.<br><br>Magicite's
      main influences were Monster Hunter and Spelunky. I loved the resource collection
      and crafting in Monster Hunter, and of course fighting giant monsters with my
      friends. Spelunky's brutal yet rewarding platforming was also something that
      I wanted to capture with Magicite. <br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> Randomly Generated Dungeons - Experience a new dungeon each
      time you play. Expect tons of trees to chop, ores to mine, plants to harvest,
      and bugs to catch! Oh and giant monsters.<br></li><li> Permanent Death - The
      game logs all of your stats in a play through, leading the way for achievements
      and upgrades.<br></li><li> Crafting System - Combine any two items to create
      a new one! For example, Wood + Wood = Plank. There are tons of combinations
      to discover!<br></li><li> Combat System - If you plan on just running in and
      swinging you sword, you're gonna get wrecked. Take time to craft useful items
      and examine enemy positioning before executing a well timed attack.<br></li><li>
      Unlockable Races, Hats, &amp; Companions - The more you play, more greater chance
      you'll unlock awesome new hats with a variety of special effects. Races and
      Companions can also be unlocked to provide different starting items and stats!<br></li><li>
      Multiplayer - Want to put your friendships to the test? This is the game to
      do it! Permanent death only occurs when the ENTIRE party has fallen. So if your
      buddy gets knocked out feel free to run over and help him back up. Or not...</li></ul>
