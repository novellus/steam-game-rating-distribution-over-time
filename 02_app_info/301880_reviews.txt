Not perfect as it sometimes has what sounds like the same quality issues as the game has in certain tracks, particularly the title/main menu music. Minor complaints to me though, not enough to say don't buy. Recommend this one over the AST-if you're going to buy one of the 2 soundtracks for the game, buy this one.","timestamp_created":1562030945,"timestamp_updated":1562030945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rpaT2OsCeIysygE="}
