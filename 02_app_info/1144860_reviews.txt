The gameplay can be a bit confusing at the start, but I'm sure that it won't take long for you to figure out how to maneuver the guy around the screen.\nAs mentioned previously, your goal is to collect stones; there're the white ones and the red ones, which offer more points, but are more rare and are usually located in dangerous places.\n\nFurthermore, if you're looking for an excuse to actually try getting a good score, there're at least 6 different achievements to get, and guess what: I've got them all in less than 10 minutes of gameplay. So, if you're a completionist kind of gamer, this could be an interesting choice to add to your library.\nAnyhow, not everything is perfect, since there's also a 10 minutes time-limit for each run that you take and that could be a bit annoying while you're chasing after these, but it's not really much of a big deal, in the end.\n\nOverall, the price is often affordable, the game is kinda fun and you can get easy achievements, so why not give it try?","timestamp_created":1609209121,"timestamp_updated":1609209317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46LCW1vYCcbWnvgI="}
