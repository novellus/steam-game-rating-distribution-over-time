    review: 'Bought the pack took a long time to acturally get it. But now that I
      got it I cannot move it from my storage to my character as there site says I
      have no character. But the game has no problem loading this character that there
      site claims doesn''t exist.


      Update after logging back in for a few logging out and refreshing the storage
      page alot it eventually showed my character and I was able to redeem it. That
      being said the site should not randomly tell you. That you do not have a character
      as it''s a very worrying sign.'
