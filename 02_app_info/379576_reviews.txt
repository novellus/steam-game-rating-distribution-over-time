It cannot maintain level flight at all. It pitches up and down wildly and too fast for trim to be of any use. I have several add on aircraft, some more challenging than others, but none are as squirrelly as this plane. Since it has NO auto pilot, there is really no way to even enjoy it at all. If you want a cool Rutan design forget this one and get the 61 LongEZ. That one is great.","timestamp_created":1552941354,"timestamp_updated":1552941354,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwZGhyekCceWsvQE="}
