The physics engine is incredibly easy to pick up and difficult to master. It's deterministic, but insanely chaotic. But if you're good enough you can get through levels very quickly. The levels have a good deal of variety, and the soundtrack is nice and relaxing. At 2.5 dollars on sale it's without a doubt worth it! Also the developers are kind and helpful. I'd recommend this game AND this studio if they ever make anything in the future.","timestamp_created":1606452774,"timestamp_updated":1606452774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx4CDhPYCfLCZswI="}
