That says it all, but I'll cover the bases.  Keyboard/mouse controls work, but the gamepad does not (although a gamepad control option is available).  The game ran smoothly, but the visuals are boring and pretty much limited to what you see in the screenshots...I haven't gotten past the first mission so I'm only assuming.  The Sky Hawk itself is loaded with missiles and guns, neither of which can be accurately aimed due to a lack  of any sort of targeting reticle/system.  Fuel, ammo and armor can be replinished from the supply points scattered around the map, but I have yet to find a way to actually pick them up or shoot them to activate.  So you eventually run out of either fuel, armor or ammo and the mission fails.  Luckily I purchased this on sale, so I'm not out a great deal of money, but I actually wouldn't recommend this \"game\" at any price unless it somehow gets finished.   If it does get fixed I'll update my review.","timestamp_created":1524893313,"timestamp_updated":1524893704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.710037291049957275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9OuvheMCe7SXnwE="}
