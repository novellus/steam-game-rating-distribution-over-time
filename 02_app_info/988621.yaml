    review: 'As strongly as I recommend the alpha volume of the soundtrack. I also
      recommend the beta volume. Like the alpha volume there are darker tracks and
      lighter tracks.  They each remind me of the emotions of life and adventures
      in wayward. it''s the sound of the way nature makes us feel. sometimes it''s
      a bitter struggle but we know we''re not the first to do it. our stories go
      untold, but we think of each other, those survivors that die in the wilderness
