The gameplay is as pure as it can be, but the production chains get really complex and can be quiet challenging (for me at least ;-)). \n\nUnfortunately, you have to learn most of the mechanics of the game by trial and error. The tutorial teaches you how to build the basic product and that’s it. After that, you will be told to watch videos. \n\nThere were many aspects of the game, like research, recycling, storage and some tools I never used – none of these were mentioned in the tutorial. Mix that with complext production chains and you get a steep learning curve, which will probably cause people to quitt he game in frustration.\n\nIn the end, I „finished“ the game (100% steam achievements, which includes producing the probably most complex good in the game), and I had a decent time doing so. But while I had fun with the game I cannot really recommend it - especially not full price. If you like these kinds of games and look for a niche pick, I would instead try Production Line : Car factory simulation (basically the same game with a little more theme, better UI and more information) or Big Pharma (the most polished game in this genre, that I have played).","timestamp_created":1608045901,"timestamp_updated":1608045901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zKbAs/YCdMO7ugI="}
