    review: "At the time of review, I have only played this for an hour.. I plan to\
      \ play it more in the coming days, but wanted to share the experience thus far.\
      \ I am giving this game a positive review because I think it does a lot of things\
      \ right, and the idea is something I want expanded on more. \nWith $5 and an\
      \ open mind, I really do believe you will get your money's worth.\n\nPros:\n\
      1. Combat feels really good to me. I love how powerful the dashes (shift by\
      \ default) feel. I've only faced a few beginner mobs so far, but they all have\
      \ unique attack patterns. Unless I'm swarmed with enemies, the combat always\
      \ makes me feel in control. \nHowever, attacking is very simple; there is no\
      \ way to mix up your combos. It is just left click spam when you want to attack.\
      \ Maybe this changes with higher level gear? Personally, I like its simplicity.\
      \ It lets you focus on movement and avoiding enemy attacks.\n\n2. I love the\
      \ music.\n\n3. There is a lot of Quality of Life in this game that I didn't\
      \ expect; Cut 1 log of a tree, and the entire thing is cut down. Progress bar\
      \ for cutting/mining. No hunger to manage. Instant-forge your bars (no need\
      \ to sit around waiting for them to smelt).\n\nCons:\n1. The Third-person controls\
      \ will take some time to get used to; You have to be in combat stance (a toggle\
      \ with Q by default) to change your camera angle, but everything else requires\
      \ your passive stance; Mining, placing objects, interacting with doors/stations...\n\
      I was able to temporarily solve this by creating a macro combining Q and F5\
      \ (Stance change, and Camera Perspective Change), but this is less than ideal.\n\
      \n2. Not the developer's fault, but there isn't much information available for\
      \ early game players; For example, I think Torches reduce enemy monster spawn\
      \ rate but I can't confirm that, and I don't know how many tiles they affect;\
      \ or where certain monsters spawn (such as the Giants). Personally, I am a little\
      \ excited to know that I will have to tackle this whole game blind.. but I know\
      \ that isn't true for everyone. \n\nSuggestions:\n1. To fix the Controls, I'd\
      \ like to see both stances allow third-person camera movement by default. Allow\
      \ basic interaction with the world while in the third person passive stance;\
      \ E.G. Mining the blocks in front of your character, or opening the door in\
      \ front of you. Lastly, for more control when harvesting resources or placing\
      \ blocks, add a Hotkey that applies screenlock and gives you the cursor while\
      \ held (I.E. Current functionality, but only while held).\n\n2. Although I have\
      \ combat in the \"Pros\" section, I would still like to see a small mix-up option;\
      \ Like a right click heavy attack or something along those lines.\n\n3. Some\
      \ form of levels would be great, even if they were only for show or had very\
      \ minor effects (like +1 hp, or slightly enhancing the suggested heavy attacks).\
      \  \n\n\nTL;DR I am genuinely impressed with what the game has accomplished\
      \ for being only $5, and I think it has a lot of potential. It's missing some\
      \ refinement (feels sort of like a Beta), but definitely has a solid foundation.\
      \ The combat in this game is responsive (and simple) and enemy attack patterns\
      \ feel very fair."
