    review: 'I wasn''t sure what to think when I purchased this game, but I like puzzles,
      it sounded intriguing, and it was on sale, so I figured "Why not?".  The concept
      is one I hadn''t seen before, and while there are quirks with it, it works well.  At
      first, I was put off by the small platforms and what seemed to be the overall
      method of solving the puzzles, but as I played more and learned how to use that
      methodology, I enjoyed it more.  In the end, I found it very enjoyable and definitely
      recommend it.


      About a week after I purchased this game, it transferred ownership to Walsh
      Technologies Corp, and the store page now says "Walsh Technologies has recently
      acquired this game. Updates and a roadmap will be coming soon".  I''m not sure
      what that means for the game, but when I played the game, the overall play time
      was roughly 1.5 to 2 hours (I''m not sure how many levels/tests there were because
      they aren''t numbered).  My recorded time is much longer because I spent quite
      a while restarting the game, testing, taking notes, and creating a discussion
      thread while the game was still open.


      I would love to see this concept expanded upon and used in a larger world, especially
      combined with a variety of different puzzles.'
