After playing it for a few weeks - this is what I have to say about it.\n\n1) It has its own style and character.  Crappy Graphics.  Cheesy Music.  Wouldn't change a thing!\n2) The raids actually feel like raids - you have to figure out their mechanics and set up your team accordingly.\n3) The raid members whine, stand in the fire, goof off, and go link dead ...  so real to form\n4) This game is a substantial nod to a very popular Level 0-60 MMORPG.  Not mentioning any names :)\n\nFor the game's price - I would classify it in the \"High Value\" category and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has ever done a raid in the older MMORPGs.\n\nUPDATE: Six years later and I'm still playing this game ...  wonderful game.","timestamp_created":1419131132,"timestamp_updated":1605691339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581440925598144531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j66q7fUCdO65Mw=="}
