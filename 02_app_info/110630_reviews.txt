It's a great lil' twin stick shooter that looks cool and has a very simple but solid setup. \n\nYou control a little space ship and shoot alien creatures in arenas that change in layout as you progress through the \"campaign.\" Powerups are all the old school type...3 way shot, Lasers and the like...\n\nGreat to play alone (very relaxing in a way) or with a friend in co-op. \n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a simple yet challenging shooter... 8/10","timestamp_created":1605285370,"timestamp_updated":1605285370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwidud4fUCe+WSrgI="}
