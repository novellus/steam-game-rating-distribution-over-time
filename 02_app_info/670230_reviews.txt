I saw it in the recent releases category of steam and the game did not have any reviews yet or anything. However, the game seemed unique and intriging and I knew right away that it was the type of game I would enjoy. Since the game just came out there were not much people playing the game. However, the developer created an official discord server (Which I found in the announcements section for the game) and I managed to play a match for a few hours with him and a few others on the day of release. The developer is super chill and he told me about new maps that he wants to make for the game. If there was ever a small bug he took note of it and is devoted to making this game as perfect as possible. Just to be clear, for a brand new game there were hardly any bugs and the game felt like it had been out for much longer. In addition to the game not being buggy I got a high FPS and my PC is not even that good. I do not think you should have trouble running this game. Onto the gameplay the game itself is a lot of fun. It consists of 4 troopers working together against a monster type enemy. Each trooper has a different asset to use such as being able to lock doors or being able to tell if the monster is nearby. The monster has 2 main abilities which are being able to go invisible as well as being able to disguise itself as a human. When I was playing a match of this game I pooped my pants sometimes when I thought I was next to one of my teammates but then they started to attack me and I realized that what I thought was one of my teammates was actually the enemy. It is such a rush. The maps themselves are also very well made and one of them even has as a tram/train that can take you to another part of the map. Overall, despite the game not having very many players as of yet, I was able to find a match through the discord server, the game is a ton of fun, and it runs super well. Just purchase it. You will not regret it.","timestamp_created":1513488003,"timestamp_updated":1513525482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51924973726272583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwocLJsuACdbqukgE="}
