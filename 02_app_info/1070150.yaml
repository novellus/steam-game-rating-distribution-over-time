      \ with an emphasis on speed, precision, and creative characters. <br><br>This\
      \ is a fighting game that rewards creativity more than any other. Whether you're\
      \ goofing off with friends or pushing your skills to the limit, you can expect\
      \ an adrenaline-filled experience every time you play. Play online (with rollback\
      \ netcode!) or locally with 2-4 players.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1070150/extras/Characters_Graphic_Steam_3.png?t=1597694816\"\
      \ /><br>Our goal with <strong>SLAYERS </strong>is to make a game that feels\
      \ like a step forward for the genre. A game that feels at once familiar, yet\

      \ playable characters: Slugger, Artist, &amp; Spy (with more hot on their heels)</strong>\
      \ - Whether you enjoy rushdown or a more methodical style of play, each character\
      \ is designed to give players the tools to approach fights any way you like.\
      \ May creativity be your only limiter!<br></li><li><strong>Unique gameplay mechanics</strong>\
      \ - We focused on creating gameplay mechanics that either open up new tools\
      \ for players to explore (<i>Focus Attacks</i>, <i>Airdash Cancels</i>) or solve\
      \ longstanding issues in platform fighters (<i>Combo Gravity</i>). <br></li><li><strong>Online\

      \ then aim for the top! Can you beat the devs?<br></li><li><strong>Controller\
      \ &amp; keyboard support</strong> - Currently you can play on Xbox, PlayStation\
      \ 4, and GameCube controllers. You can also reconfigure and save your controls\

    review: "There is literally 0 reason to approach, just pick spy and spam incredibly\
      \ non-commital projectiles that are way too big. There's a lot of hurtbox jank,\
      \ where you are placed and where you are sent by moves seems very arbitrary.\
      \ The aesthetic is incredibly bland and inoffensive, blizzard sure did strike\
      \ gold with Overwatch and I will never not dislike it. I don't know if it's\
      \ the camera, but one of the two battlefields (3 stages btw) this game has is\
      \ incredibly large and top platform is not easily accessible without hella commitment.\
      \ All of the game feel feels incredibly stiff yet flaccid at the same time outside\
      \ of the honestly distracting amounts of hitlag. I really don't know what they're\
      \ going for with the right stick's functionality, I have no clue whether or\
      \ not it's supposed to be a smash stick and a special stick, or they just don't\
      \ have full movesets programmed yet, or what. This is incredibly rambly but\
      \ that's because I can't be arsed to write a review for this when there's so\
      \ much that needs to be fixed before this was put on steam for 5 dollars as\
      \ early access.\n\nWhy did they give the zoner of the cast a special designed\
      \ to force approaches instead of literally anyone else, why does she have 2\
      \ different porportionally GIGANTIC projectiles, one of which kills and trades\
      \ on hit, why does she have a short hop double nair, why did they give her an\
      \ aerial down special with very little tell (if it's not near instant) that\
      \ covers more than her entire body, and a back air the size of a moon and kills\
      \ at 60 and has ROB pushback so it's incredibly hard to punish outside of the\
      \ conceptually cool but very rough-feeling shield. Spy makes me think that she\
      \ was designed by an ultimate zoner main who really had a hard on for blazblue\
      \ despite being equally bad at it, too.\n\n I will revise if patches tweak this\
      \ game up, but this is yet another platform fighter that wants to be melee but\
      \ with quirky movesets and \"fixing the bad parts\". That's great and all, but\
      \ there is 0 reason to play this over melee unless you want to bring this to\
      \ a local because you're tired of spending 5 dollars to go 0-2 and you really\
      \ want to be the best player in the venue at SOMETHING.\n\nI'd genuinely rather\
      \ play Icons than bust this out again.\n"
