    review: 'I really wanted to love this game. The setting, the characters, I wanted
      it to be great, and it was at first. Then came the choices. The stats are too
      overly complicated to relate to the choices given to you and it''s hard to figure
      out exactly what each choice will come out to be. Not that I''m against being
      surprised, but when you''re trying to decide if a game changing choice is going
      to use your "reflex" or "finesse" skill then it becomes too stressful for this
      genre of game.


      The writing, oh god, the writing. It was superb, easy to follow the narrative,
      and it was really immersive. Until about half way through the game. The author
      wanted to make the plot more complex and add new characters and mechanics, but
      ultimately it ended up being a quagmire of different words that felt important,
      but was hard to relate to other parts of the story. This includes the characters
      too. Each character felt unique and special in their own way, but when you got
      into the nitty gritty of the story in the later chapters, they lost their luster
      and unless you were focusing on one or two specific characters, you simply could
      not keep track of them and many were left in the background as you went through
      your branch of the story.


      Long story short, pick this up if it''s on sale, otherwise, go play Choice of
      Robots. Choice of the Deathless is even easier to follow than this one, and
      Deathless is just one huge time jumping flashback.'
