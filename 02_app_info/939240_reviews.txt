I liked the prospect of being able to play in an historical context, but the controlling the pawns with a seemingly random rythym is so hard to do. Not to mention how roughly the game moves; there is no clear dilineation between the sounds I am making with \"wasd\" and the examples that are expected of me. the controls either need to be simplified or they need to be easier to understand. If you expect me to follow a pattern, I need to be able to see that pattern (i.e. Dance Dance Revolution).\n   I quit the game in the first minute out of confusion. Firstly, there is not currently an instrutions or directions screen/ interface, just \"continue\" and \"quit\". Secondly, there is no clear game tutorial sequence-- even having a single fram that says tutorial would have been nice-- because \"Listen closer\" is so vague. Thirdly, the reason I quit is that I thought the game had frozen. \n   Now after reading the reviews and all discussions, I found that the game is based on the rythym of the background noises. This by the way should have been mentioned in the game description. I tired to give the game another chance and I will say that I was able to make so much more progress, I marched down the trail, linked up with my battalion, and then I stumbled into a bug where my men were left behind while marching to the range. This is when I quit for the second time. \n   I will not be giving this game a third try until significant changes and/or updates are made. I am all out of words, I dont think I could be more disappointed.. \n\n      J.","timestamp_created":1542515911,"timestamp_updated":1542515911,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lZ3HkucCe77/rgE="}
