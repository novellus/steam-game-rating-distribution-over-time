It is still great to play, the characters acting is professional and really brings the story to life. The only thing negative is a few tough spots in game, you will get frustrated, but it is totally worth it. Also, i'd have to say this video game (Im pretty sure) had the first and most well done portrayal of a gay man in a time when being homosexual in film was really hammed up. Really worth checking out, nostalgia or not!","timestamp_created":1609952512,"timestamp_updated":1609952512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgLmp7PYCds2GwQI="}
