    review: "All the thumbs down say it wont start. Read the manual people, or at\
      \ the very least, read the reference material and the startup check list. This\
      \ is actually a fun plane to start, its a really neat process.\n\nMake sure\
      \ you lean your fuel above 10k if you have auto-mixture off. \n\nWatch those\
      \ landing speeds. I did what I thought was a decent tactical/attack landing\
      \ and Lt Iron first over here blew the tires. I'm sure the trainer was very\
      \ impressed. \n\nCool plane, and like the name indicates, it'll mentor you."
