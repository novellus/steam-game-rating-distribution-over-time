The same goes for battle scenarios, there are about five different types and that's it.\n\nCombat system is tedious. The main character attacks automaticly to the enemy on it's front without input of the player, whose only job is to move it for one place to another avoiding hits and using \"strong attacks\" that recharge every few automated slashes for more damage. If it wasn't for the slow paced movement, it could even be considered entertained for the first ten times.\n\nMusic is just there, there is one track for the menus, another for the world map in \"Story Mode\" and another one for combat. That's it. None of them are memorable or even fitting. After a while, it's like and audio-torture.\n\nStory mode has it's moments, but it's hindered by the aforementioned points. There is also a wave mode, which is just combat after combat without the story.\n\nAchivements are extremely frustrating, specially the \"Dark Legend\" one, which consist on hundreds of repetitive combats.\nIf it wasn't because i like to have 100% completition in my games to the point of obsession, i would have removed this thing from my library long time ago.\n\nIn my humble opinion, not worth it even for free. Can entertain for a few minutes and after that, it becomes a chore. There are better options to waste your finite time in this reality.","timestamp_created":1607675454,"timestamp_updated":1607687561,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48qvpqPYCf6OCuQI="}
