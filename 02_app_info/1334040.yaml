      \ /><br><br>The Old Yin Mansion<br>In Beijing's western suburbs lies a mansion\
      \ upon a wooded mountain. At the end of the Qing dynasty it belonged to the\
      \ Yin family; the master of which was born into aristocracy, attaining great\
      \ success as a youth and was highly valued by the imperial court. Leading an\
      \ army, he pacified the lands far and wide, and would later marry a woman of\
      \ similar social standing.  Yet, their good fortune was to be short lived. When\
      \ power over the imperial court shifted, Master Yin fell into a deep depression,\
      \ and decided to live in seclusion.<br>Thus, he chose a patch of land with suitable\
      \ feng shui, with both mountains and rivers, and built his mansion. The only\
      \ ones accompanying him were his personal attendants and two disciples. One\
      \ of which was the erudite scholar Mr. Liu, the other Zhao, an expert painter.\
      \ While his life was markedly more lonely than before, it was peaceful. Master\
      \ Yin had wanted a son for many long years, and finally, the Mistress became\
      \ pregnant. Yet, this created ripples much like a stone upon a still pond. Terrible\
      \ rumors were spread, stirring the hearts of those in the mansion, and a series\
