The movement mechanics are also perfect, the rocket jumping & dashing are so tight that you never feel cheated by the game when you die, you're just annoyed by your own failure and mistiming-- which, by the way, there absolutely is a 1:1 correlation with your skill and your success in this game; however, each progressive level builds on skills learned in the last: I went from dying an embarrassing amount of times, to impressing myself with some of my artful sequences in later runs (though was quickly humbled looking at the leaderboards, some people are truly machines).\n\nAnyway, apart from the most important aspect (the gameplay, which is stellar), the visuals and the soundtrack are awesome, case-in-point: I usually mute games, but didn't find myself doing that here.\n\nOverall: highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1608113649,"timestamp_updated":1608113649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41t7CtfYCffnUugI="}
