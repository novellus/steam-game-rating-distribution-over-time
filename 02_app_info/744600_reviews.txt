It is roller-coaster level of sickness. I foolishly assumed that it would be more of a puzzle game, slow, more tactical fight where managing your ship would be most important. But no, it is action packed and with very quick steering that makes you sick. Maybe if you can play anything in VR you could find it fun. Maybe after I recover I will play challenges and it may be more managable.","timestamp_created":1604073173,"timestamp_updated":1604073173,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4gMaNvfUCe7GLqwI="}
