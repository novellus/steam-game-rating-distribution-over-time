      Anime Girls - A Personal Message from the Developer<br><br>Thank you for considering
      my game. 99 Anime Girls is an indie game that I''ve spent 2 and a half years
      working on. I''ve always wanted to make games and now, finally, I''m excited
      to bring it to you. You''ll find a mix of old-school platform jumping, cute
      characters and simple mini-games inspired by my time in Japan as well as a unique
      quirkiness that only comes with indie freedom. 99 Anime Girls is finally complete
      and all of the levels are done! Are you ready for an adventure? What are you
      waiting for? 99 Anime Girls is available now!<br><br>99 Anime Girls - PC Version
      Notes<br><br>- The game is designed for 9:16 <i>portrait</i>, if you''re running
      landscape you''ll get black boxes on the sides, meh it doesn''t really matter,
      the game play is all there but for best results rotate your monitor and set
      your display settings to portrait mode.<br>- The game is playable with mouse
      and keyboard. In addition there is xbox controller support for the main platform
      levels.<br>- The main characters will run automatically. You control the other
      moves such as jump, double jump etc.<br>- <strong>The game starts off easy,
      but trust me, it does get harder!</strong><br>- There are 25 Steam achievements
      to collect in addition to 36 in-game achievements!<br>- This is the PC port.
      The mobile version has ads and a one time unlock fee whereas the PC version
