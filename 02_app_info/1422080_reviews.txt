All i can say is great music great atmosphere, VERY immersive, and its fun.  Waking up today i didnt know Id become Tobias Turdschitz of my very own Turdschitz kingdom,  Will update more after i get more time in game.  \nTotally tubuler.\n\nUpdate- im addicted\n\nThe interface is very intuitive i only studied the tutorial 5 minutes and i knew how to play the game.  I love the fact that theres lots of decision making, and u feel like your far away in kingdoms fighting for your people.  The bardic music is  really nice and this is a good game to play while listening to talk radio if u want to turn it off.  Its very addicting and  i woulda payed more for this game, how far it will go i dont know, but i know within 1 hour of playing i got completely addicted .   If youre thinking about buying it, just get it, you wont be disappointed for the price.","timestamp_created":1601592890,"timestamp_updated":1601681480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483004748821258545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlPvp9fQCeY2lpQI="}
