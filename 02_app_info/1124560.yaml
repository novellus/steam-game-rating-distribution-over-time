      \ combat, lore driven items and weapons, and fun character progression to suit\
      \ your preferred combat style. Set in a world inspired by biblical Apocrypha\
      \ and more than a little modern style, the many realms of Heaven are a strange\
      \ and varied place. Lucifer won\u2019t just be slicing his way through pearly\
      \ gates and angelic choirs, but strange high-tech constructs, idyllic earth-like\
      \ plains, floating islands, and more. Each Archangel will have a strong, thematic\

    review: "The games visuals are great, the game is fun, the voice acting is alright,\
      \ the music is great. Good \n\nAs for my personal preferences.\n\nEdit:\nThis\
      \ game is cool, and its got great visuals, but I don't agree with the devil\
      \ may cry aspect as I don't see anything that really relates to the game apart\
      \ for the fact that you have extremely limited aerial combat and that you are\
      \ playing as a demon. The stamina system feels like a very counter productive\
      \ implementation if you are taking inspiration from DMC, hence where i guess\
      \ the \"Souls like\" mechanics come in. I think this game is fine and has great\
      \ potential but its just not for me and doesn't satisfy that in depth combat\
      \ that i am looking for."
