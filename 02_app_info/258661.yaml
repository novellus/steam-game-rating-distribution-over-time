      \ to replace ageing DMUs and the older Class 17s.<br><br>With a top speed of\

      \ services as well.<br><br>The intensive, high speed running of push-pull services\
      \ saw reliability begin to suffer, and the Class began to be phased out of revenue\

    review: 'Gameplay Video;


      https://youtu.be/gVo6DBwvtLI


      Pros;

      - Accurately detailed model, operates well.

      - Makes a nice addition to Port Road content.


      Cons;

      - Lacks decent scenarios.

      - Sounds are a bit off.

      - One livery for all...


      The Class 27 DLC is one for a specific audience. Early heritage diesel fan?
      Interested in Scottish rolling stock? Then you''ll like this (or at least how
      it exists). Otherwise, unless you''re looking for more content for the Port
      Road DLC, it''s not a must-buy.


      For the seasoned enthusiast, the first annoying hurdle will be the sound. I''m
      not a seasoned enthusiast, but watching the video back I noticed the engine
      sounds are a bit too generic. I''m not clued up enough to deduce exactly why
      they were generic, but you''ll understand if you''ve driven other TS diesel
      locomotives.


      For outsiders who are looking for an interesting new simulation experience,
      you won''t find it here. Out of the box, you get two very basic scenarios (passenger
      services Stranraer Harbour/Newton Stewart and Carlisle Citadel/Dumfries with
      basic AI movements). There are obviously plenty more to choose from in the Workshop,
      however most of these are limited to the Port Road route because of the single
      livery supplied. It would have been nice to see a BR Blue livery at least? We
      could have got some more realistic West Highland Line scenarios then...


      If you''ve come here for a specific reason, you''ll be moderately pleased, which
      is why I''ve recommended this. Looking for a new experience? Nah, don''t bother.'
