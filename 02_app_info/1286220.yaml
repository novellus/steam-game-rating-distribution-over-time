    about_the_game: After hostilities have broken out in Central Europe, the race
      is on as a pressured US Navy escort force battle off Soviet bomber and submarine
      attacks on a perilous quest to reinforce NATO defenders in Europe. Meanwhile,
      in the Persian Gulf, the conflict between Iran and Iraq risks escalating into
      a larger confrontation between superpowers as both sides indiscriminately attack
      neutral merchant shipping. And in the Norwegian Sea, an outnumbered Soviet surface
      force challenges the might of a massive US Navy amphibious force bound for occupied
      Norway...<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1286220/extras/gif_2_sam2b.gif?t=1605204783"
      /><br><br>Brought to you by the lead designer of <strong>Cold Waters</strong>,
      <strong>Sea Power</strong> lets you control NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in a
      modern naval conflict. Whether it's gunning it out with Boghammars in a surface
      duel, fighting off aerial attackers armed with long-range missiles, or hunting
      for enemy submarines with aircraft and surface ships, advanced weaponry and
      sensors are at your disposal. Can you successfully hide your forces while detecting
      and tracking theirs? It is up to you to play an advanced game of cat and mouse
      on the high seas, to seize the initiative and attack with the advantage of surprise
      on your side. And at all times, you have to observe rules of engagement and
      take care not to cause an unnecessary incident that could lead to escalation.
      After all, you cannot really be sure just who that radar contact at 30.000 feet
      is, can you?<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1286220/extras/gif_new_above2.gif?t=1605204783"
