    developer_response: "Hey, thanks for the feedback. It\u2019s super helpful on\
      \ improving the overall experience.\n\nI could reassure you the scenes in the\
      \ Launch trailer are all included within the early access version of the game.\
      \ Please, let me know if there\u2019s anything I missed and I\u2019ll try my\
      \ best to correct any issues. \n\nGame usually runs 2 to 3 hours if it\u2019\
      s your first play-through. As a reminder this is Episode I of a larger experience\
      \ on the way. Thanks for your patience with any frustration in encountering\
      \ bugs or glitches due to it being early access.\n\nThe demo released a year\
      \ ago is a completely different experience. I can promise you that there have\
      \ been many additional levels added and experiences that were never included\
      \ in the demo. I hope to continue in expanding what we currently have in Early\
      \ Access.\n\nI\u2019m truly honored and humbled by your feedback and it has\
      \ made the five year experience worth it all. Thank you. It helps me grow. \n\
      \nAs a reminder Hideo Kojima is mentioned in the \u201Cspecial thanks\u201D\
      \ section of the credits. He has no involvement in the game development, but\
      \ has been an inspiration."

    review: 'Half of the scenes in the trailer are not in the game. There is no saving
      or level select, which wouldn''t be an issue if the game did not crash or loaded
      the next level correctly.


      The game is about twenty minutes long, but everyone reviewing it has 2 hours
      played, because it is impossible to avoid restarting the game from the beginning
      because of a soft-lock. Oh the crystal fell out of the map? Better restart from
      the beginning.


      The demo released a year ago is just as buggy but missing a few connecting scenes.
      The game ends abruptly before it really even begins.


      Half of the cutscenes do not trigger correctly. I had to play through the first
      stage several times and only got the enemies to spawn ONE time.


      I cannot recommend this game, unless you are a masochist or want a good laugh
      at what five years of someone''s life looks like.


      Also Hideo Kojima is credited in the game''s introduction, but as far as I can
      tell he had no involvement.


      (There is another reviewer here who gave this a positive review, with one game
      in his library and has been a steam member for 19 hours. Real suspicious)'
