The screenshots, the Description, what you get if you pay, and how its \"community developed\". \n\nLook into the forums on steam about this game, you can CLEARLY see that Developers are lieing left and right about the current situtation of the game, they say stuff is in the game that clearly isn't. When you call them on it, they just restart a new thread and act like everything is fine!\n\nAnd thats just about the game before even playing it. \n\nAfter playing it heres a review.\n\nPay 15$, only to log in and get blocked by, Another PAYWALL! This game has TONS of paywalls, from needing premium to do basic tasks, to needing to buy keys to loot your own kills. Not only that, but they have a ingame  cash shop to get even more money from you, you have to PAY to change your name, you have to PAY to rename your faction, you have to PAY to get revived faster. You have to PAY to sell things ingame, You have to PAY to produce things faster then 1 at a time.  It says \"15$ for a full account\" But the full account is just BS. All they give you is premium clothing, THE END.\n\n It stops there, third weapon slots are still glitched and don't work properly for paying customers, when asking a Developer about it, they said, Ohh thats for premium players to make it work properly. EVEN THOUGH THEY CLEARLY POSTED ITS FOR 15$ ACCOUNTS!\n\nYou're limited still to just your one apartment which no one will EVER use because other players can enter at anytime and loot it. Making spending all your ingame cash on it, stupid and pointless and a waste of time.\n\n\nThe game developers constantly say \"we are listening to players for feedback and developement.\" There is hundreds of forums for this game asking for the same thing over and over and developers REFUSE and keep saying it over and over that they don't want to do that. But will ask again and keep saying, \"we want community feedback but wont listen to it.\" \n\nAnd if you can deal with all that, the game itself is pointless, money is earned by sitting in the corner of the map shooting a gun with unlimited ammo at a rock with infinity gear. You get all your materials from the rock and recycle it only to find out, that if you arn't a premium member, your limited to earning 10k a day. Like I said, if you pay your paywall, it goes away. \n\nAnother thing wrong is combat, There is no punishment for killing other players, its rewarded. You shoot newbies and everyone when they don't expect it, take there gear and sell it, but your limited to 100 market transations at once WITH A PAIDED ACCOUNT, BUT Heres the paywall, if you pay EXTRA your not limited.\n\nSame thing with storage, ingame you have storage, if you pay Extra RL money, u get no storage limit, if you buy a basic account, you get the same storage as a free account. \n\n\nI'll change this review if the developers care to listen to what players have been TELLING them about for the past years and they havn't been fixing anything at a reasonable pace.  They've infact been slowly changing this game to its former self 3 years ago.","timestamp_created":1423861059,"timestamp_updated":1538887809,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":438,"votes_funny":19,"weighted_vote_score":"0.94526439905166626","comment_count":17,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/o63puYCdfuQNw=="}
