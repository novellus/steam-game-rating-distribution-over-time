      /><br><br>Malmyr is a story based game about building and maintaining production
      chains. It is meant to be relaxing but challenging. You will have to control
      where your resources are diverted to and ensure that there are enough workers
      to fulfill your missions. Don''t be fooled by the simple and stylized look of
      Malmyr - The game is getting very complex, very fast.<br><br>You are sent to
      the forgotten lands of Malmyr by your King to expand the kingdom''s territory
      and exploit Malmyr''s precious ore deposits. While doing so you find out about
      the sinister fate of the Dwarves that once inhabited the continent. You will
      have to protect the kingdom from suffering the same!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1470320/extras/steamBanner2.png?t=1608750418"
      /><br><br>We are two very passionate german devolpers with freshly finished
      degrees who always wanted to make games. Due to the current circumstances, we
      decided to take a leap of faith and go for it. While buying this game you should
      keep that in mind. Malmyr is made with great love for detail and we hope that
      we can offer unique challenges with each mission, but it cannot offer hundreds
      of hours of playtime like bigger games with actual funding and a budget can.<br><br>While
      we cannot promise to expand the game''s content and currently have no plans
      to do so, we will do our best to optimize the game after release and address
      any issues coming up. Ziegler gamedev has the vision &quot;Making dreams come
      true&quot;. We feel that part of that also is making the best game we can for
      our players.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1470320/extras/steamBanner3.png?t=1608750418"

    review: 'As a preface, I''m not much of a building simulation gamer (right now),
      and I hoped this would rekindle my love for the genre.


      It didn''t but not because it''s lacking quality.


      In it''s essence (and as far as I''ve played), this is as much a puzzle game
      as it is a building sim. You play missions (there''s an open end mode too) and
      have to achieve goals in them. To achieve these missions, you need to build
      certain structures while keeping in mind rules for logistics among the different
      building types.


      You need, for example, a specific minimum amount of workers to man your buildings.
      Workers live in houses, which need to be in a two field radius around a farm.
      Clay pits and mines need one or more building to refine their goods, so roads
      need to be build between all of these and the buildings that use them. And so
      on and so forth.


      Often you''ll find yourself scrapping buildings or roads that you either don''t
      need anymore, or to correct an error you made. Most tiles or building can yield
      additional harvest using a clicker mechanic, allowing you to restart broken
      logistics cycles after you fixed it, removing harsh penalties and allowing for
      experimentation.'
