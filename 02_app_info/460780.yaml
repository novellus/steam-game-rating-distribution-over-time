    review: 'The final and rather thrilling chapter of the Avadon Trilogy.


      Ok, before I start - lets get this out of the way.  You really should only play
      this game if you played the first two otherwise you may find yourself lost or
      not nearly invested at whats at stake here.  The story writing is great, but
      without playing the first two the impact of everything happening in the final
      chapter may not seem as big of deal.


      I say that because you won''t get the full figure of RedBeard''s Madness, or
      how unlikeable Protus actually is for a guy who initially seems likeable, the
      perspectives of two of your Companions Nathalie and Khalida who are from the
      first two games, and the overall love hate relationship you find yourself with
      Avadon and being a corrupt Federal Police Force in a Fantasy Setting.


      You face Moral Decisions of course, like the other two and they are just as
      gray and complicated as before, though this time around you seem to be able
      to pull more weight in hopefully trying to influence Avadon for the better...
      or worse.  But more importantly you get to see the ultimate closing chapter
      and fate of Avadon.


      The gameplay has been streamlined and the leveling up has being simplified a
      little bit, less decisions but less opportunities to screw over your build.  It''s
      pretty straightforward now and hammered out some of the loose ends and more
      useless options.


      The graphics are mostly the same, minor tweaks... though still the Spiderweb
      Signature setup.  The writing and mechanics carry the game.  Though the background
      sounds is still as immersive as ever.  There are lots of references to the first
      two games, it''s nice to see familiar faces...and kill some of them.


      Overall, get it but only after you finished the first two and ready to see where
      it all ends.'
