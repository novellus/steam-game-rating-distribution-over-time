When seeing a painted wall, the player does not immediately assume they have to change the color of said wall in order to draw in an item that is otherwise unseen, that's just poor design. [spoiler] Chapter 8 Floor 3 for anyone wondering. [/spoiler]\n    [*] One of the worst things a puzzle game can do is implement a new mechanic or item into a puzzle without ever having explained it. Somehow, Chromagun manages to repeat puzzles increasing in difficulty so mildly that it feels like an extended tutorial for the first few Chapters, yet still introduce the mirror (an item easily circumvented for the remainder of the game) without any tutorial.\n[/list]\n\n\nOn top of that: 100% in <4 hours, with regular breaks prepping for New Years. There's just not much here for the price","timestamp_created":1609483303,"timestamp_updated":1609483688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505327224731445313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhIOt3vYCdoKpvwI="}
