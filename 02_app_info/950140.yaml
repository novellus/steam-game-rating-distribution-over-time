    review: 'The main character in Corey Martin''s Hiding Spot wants to hide away
      from everything. Relatable. In this clever twist on block pushing games, you
      are finally able to make use of the playable character''s god-given limbs to
      crouch down, grab, and pick up various office furnishings. These boxes, desks,
      and other such things each have their own assymetric behaviour when you push
      or pull on them, making for some very interesting puzzles. The most fascinating
      aspect of these puzzles is their uniquely creative goal, requiring you to encase
      the character in a 1x1x1 space surrounded by furniture.


      The game''s sombre art style and ambience manage to convey its psychological
      and mental health themes without ever explicitly acknowledging them. It''s also
      a very peaceful atmosphere, perfect for puzzle solving, with the occasional
      humorous moments as you perform all sorts of strange furniture-on-head balancing
      acts. Some of the furniture was occasionally buggy but a quick undo would always
      deal with it.


      Very different to Pipe Push Paradise and seemingly smaller in scope, it''s easy
      to see how Hiding Spot might have been a chance to explore some of the ideas
      coming to Corey Martin''s upcoming game, Bonfire Peaks, for which I am waiting
      in anticipation. It is nonetheless full of great ideas and fascinating puzzles
      in its own right.'
