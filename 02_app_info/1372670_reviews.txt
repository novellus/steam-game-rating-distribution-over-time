It's a challenging puzzler that only relies on symbols and iconography to teach the player the rules of any given challenge. The cartoon art style is effective at translating all information required for the player to solve the puzzles. The strict time limit adds a nice sense of urgency, and the addition of a \"notepad\" in the game hearkens back to the days of PC gaming where game booklets and manuals had pages of empty space for the player to write down learned knowledge. The $5.00 price tag is more than reasonable for this type of game (I'm reminded of \"Frog Detective,\" in that sense). I'm looking forward to playing more.","timestamp_created":1604777784,"timestamp_updated":1604777784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrLaN0vUCcKf9rAI="}
