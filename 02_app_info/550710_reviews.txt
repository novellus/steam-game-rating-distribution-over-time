If you've played the game, you'll know what to expect, and whether you do or do not want to buy is your choice. I reccomend this because Klepacki, once again, did a great job with the soundtrack.\n\nSide note by OP: It's like dubstep, but good. Favorite Tracks are Cranioid Attack and Soldier Formation.","timestamp_created":1482159581,"timestamp_updated":1486569670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602799296379089355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw16Cdj9oCe+vMbA=="}
