    review: Boot Hill Heroes is one of the best RPGs I've played in recent years.
      Exceptional storytelling, awesome soundtrack, and an interesting combat system.
      I went into this game expecting a mediocre RPGMaker experience to clear out
      my backlog, not something that was going to get me hooked and begging for more.
