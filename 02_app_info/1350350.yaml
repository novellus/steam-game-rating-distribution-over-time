    review: "So, first review I've written, which shows how much I like this VN.\n\
      Short explanation:\n\nPros: \nBeautiful graphics\nVery good and fitting music\n\
      Sweet story with funny, serious, and romantic comedy moments.\nThe characters\
      \ acting feels natural (in my opinion, aside from possibly one character)\n\n\
      Cons: \nA few grammatical typos here and there, while not too much of a bother,\
      \ they aren't unnoticeable \nFeels too short; 1.4 hours and I finished the story.\
      \ While I was satisfied with how things ended, I wish there was more.\nAlmost\
      \ no voice acting.\n\nLong explanation:\nI really liked the story. While the\
      \ typos did show up here and there, and there was practically non-existent voice\
      \ acting, I still enjoyed the story, and the graphics (along with the music)\
      \ were a definite bonus to that; seeing the characters changing their expressions\
      \ according to what is being said rather than only changing their expression\
      \ when they start talking is very nice. The only real complaint (the typos are\
      \ a minor complaint, I could deal with them as I was reading) is that it felt\
      \ too short, and while I enjoyed the romance, I wish there were more routes\
      \ available (Youmu Konpaku fan here). \nSomething I noticed, you can actually\
      \ see things happen that the characters themselves don't notice, as in something\
      \ happens that they don't realize until later, but you get to see happen as\
      \ they are traveling, a touch that I didn't always see in the games I've played.\
      \ \n\nI won't give a something/10, but I still really liked the story, and can\
      \ feel that I will come back to it even after having seen the end just to see\
      \ some of the funnier scenes again (along with that final scene, really heart\
      \ warming). If only the developers could add routes for some of the other characters,\
      \ and maybe add some more content to Reimu's route, like after the final scene.\
      \ Still, this makes me wish even more to be able to see Gensokyo with my own\
      \ eyes at least once, if not get to live a happy life there."
