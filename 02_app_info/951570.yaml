    about_the_game: You find yourself confined to a wheelchair in a gloomy old research
      facility.<br>Where am I? Why am I here? Where do I go from here? <br>The spine-chilling
      eerie spaces and your imagination will fuel your fear leading you to the realization
      that something horrible has happened here. <br>Trying to hide from the undead
      will make your heart race and take your breath away, because you cannot kill
      what is already dead.<br>In creating Deadness the emphasis was on the game looking
      as realistic as possible, <br>including intuitive controls, naturalistic graphics
      and horror atmosphere.<br>Just like in reality, on the wheelchair you can only
      move using your hands which control all the movements which makes the game feel
      even more realistic.<br> <br>You are going to feel utterly helpless. This game
      will give you nightmares...<br><strong>This is no game anymore!</strong>
