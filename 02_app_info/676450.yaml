    about_the_game: "This is the Memory game that you won't be able to stop playing\
      \ till you beat all 21 stages. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game sounds simple: <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nMemorize the locations of cards then match card pairs.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nYet as the number of cards increase in subsequent stages,\
      \ you'll have to push your memory to make matches. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired\
      \ by 1990's pre-rendered graphics and bulletin board games, Double memory focuses\
      \ on casual gameplay and challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery level is separated\
      \ into three stages. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nAfter completing a warmup stage, you'll\
      \ be faced with Limited Attempts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Limited Attempts,\
      \ three incorrect card matches will force you to try again. Don't worry, there\
      \ are as many continues as you need. The goal is to concentrate and quickly\
      \ memorize card locations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter beating a Limited Attempts\
      \ stage, you'll move onto Timed Attempts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a Timed Attempts\
      \ stage, not only are you challenged with a maximum of two incorrect matches,\
      \ but you also have only 25 seconds to complete all matches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe first few stages will be easy, but as more cards are introduced into the\
      \ mix, Double Memory becomes a real challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're invited\
      \ to push your memory to its limits in...Double Memory."
