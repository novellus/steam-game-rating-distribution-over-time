    review: 'I played through the game once trying to model a Starfleet officer type
      character.  The game generally allowed for that.  As others have noted, it''s
      a relatively short game which is both good and bad.  It make subsequent playthroughs
      to try different strategies less onerous but, at the same time, makes it difficult
      to develop a lot of depth in either the story or the characters within that
      story.


      Overall, for the price, it isn''t bad.  Just don''t expect it to be the best
      CYOA novel out there.'
