Then you start to move through the world, and discover that functionality and features have been prioritised to enhance the 'shop front' for an early access game.  The devs have stated that they are following their own take on an 'agile' delivery, with no coherent delivery map of features or functionality.  Indeed, at the moment, they are sprucing up the opening scenes to presumably cut back on requested refunds through steam.  So if you want early access with a MASSIVE emphasis on early, AND you enjoy long odds on investments paying dividends, then this is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1584626716,"timestamp_updated":1584626716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485265731811523438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1pnH+fACce+b+QE="}
