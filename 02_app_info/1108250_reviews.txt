I am giving it a very tentative thumbs up because it is somewhat fun but you restart after every level - it seems odd - why not allow the player to keep cranking for a high score?\n\nIt might be because it was intentionally built for multi-player and not single player? Not sure but I would recommend the dev fixes that.\n\nAs it stands, it's a decent shooter with a great variety of enemies and bullet patterns. I think the sound effects for the various things going on needs improvement. Controls seem to stick sometimes - I will have full energy but can't fire my secondary weapon even after it is fully cooled down.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this at more than a few dollars with the current level of gameplay but encourage the dev to keep cranking on it - seems like it's the foundation of something really good.","timestamp_created":1601359840,"timestamp_updated":1601359840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsICf7PQCffXipAI="}
