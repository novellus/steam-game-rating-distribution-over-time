He's the man, the man with the plan. He got them sweaters and is always looking better. My sisters be tripping, over all the Harold they missin'. This weird lady named SHHH got them all feeling crushed. He got a bird, and them coffee grounds got him so disturbed. Everyone's acting weird, while poor old Harold is just trying to get clear. Falling in love with Harold only gets more bearable with the time you must make for this man's sweet parable. He owns a VHS store with a mug in hand, and always like to see beyond the bland.
