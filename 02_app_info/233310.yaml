    review: "If you know how Jeff Vogel's Spiderweb Software \"works\" you'll know\
      \ what to expect. SS has a distinctive small company home-brew like house feel\
      \ and style to their isometric grid based point & click RPGs games, which you'll\
      \ either find charming or primitive.\n\nAvadon 2 is similar to the first Avadon\
      \ and continues the story, there is now a part 3. \nSpiderweb's titles can be\
      \ run on anything from Potato to NASA Supercomputer."
