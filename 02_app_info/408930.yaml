    about_the_game: "ePic Character Generator is not a game. It is an excellent tool\
      \ for anyone who wants to create realistic character avatars in no time. You\
      \ can simply choose what items to display on your character, save as an image\
      \ on a preset or transparent background, and use it for anything you would like\
      \ to. You don't have to worry about lighting or finding the right camera angles,\
      \ as everything has been prerendered and post-worked for you, so creating characters\
      \ is really just a matter of clicking some buttons! Using the Portrait package\
      \ you can even create hand-drawn style images very easily.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe software is mainly used by role-players to illustrate their player and\
      \ non-player characters, but don't have the resources to create or buy many\
      \ unique characters that fit their needs. The option to save the images as tokens\
      \ and cards simultaneously even reduces the work needed to use the pictures\
      \ in a session moments after they've been created. The characters can be saved\
      \ and loaded using our custom file format, which enables an easy way to manage\
      \ character progression, as changing little details are quick and convenient.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe generated images can be used in commercial products as\
      \ well. You may find card games, board games, and books illustrated with the\
      \ images created by ePic Character Generator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you experience\

    review: Very easy to use, and with the extension to save as .psd, the creativity
      never ends.  I'm looking forward to more season packs to be released.
