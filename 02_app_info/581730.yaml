    about_the_game: "First and foremost, this game is an experiment in coding a software\
      \ renderer. It's an engine that renders the image via CPU, without involving\
      \ the graphics adapter, much like the 90's games did. I wanted to find out if\
      \ it's possible to code an engine like that from scratch nowadays, and if it\
      \ can run at 60 FPS on a modern PC. It was a self-imposed challenge.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nOnce I finished the engine, I thought I could make a game with it,\
      \ an FPS like the early shooters from the 90's. I have to say I was quite impressed\
      \ with them back in the day, and I've been looking to recreate them for a long\
      \ time. Thus, this game is a 90's FPS. A simplistic story takes a backseat to\
      \ pure run-and-gun gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn graphics and visuals: I was\
      \ creating the visuals based on the imagery from my dreams. I tried to convey\
      \ the mood and atmosphere of my dreams through level design. I feel like I did\
      \ a particularly good job on this aspect.<br />\r\nI'd be happy to hear some\
      \ feedback from you on my humble little game!"

    review: 'Autumn Night 3D shooter should be FREE to play and not come with a price
      tag. Self-described as "A 3D shooter made in the spirit of the the 90s'' FPSes"
      - truth be told, this game would have been outdated if it had come out in the
      early 90s and stood next to Ultima Underworld or Elder Scrolls Arena - both
      of which you can pick up for less than $8.99 .

      If you like Hexen/Heretic you can pick them up on Steam - for $1 more than Autumn
      Night 3D you get the entire bundle with Heretic 1, Hexen 1 & 2 + Deathkings
      of the Dark Citadel.

      Other newer games catch the 90s feel and look with much better gameplay: Amid
      Evil, Apocryph, Dusk, Ziggurat and Wrath Aeon of Ruin.'
