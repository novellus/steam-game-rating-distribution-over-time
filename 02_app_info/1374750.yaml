      /><br><br>Out of Place deals with a serious theme telling the adventure of a
      teenage protagonist and his machine companion.<br><br>It shows the challenge
      of questioning the irresponsible actions and opinions of older generations without
      losing your roots. Moreover, it underlines how hard it is to overcome the fear
      of the future, but instead take action for a better world. These topics are
      embraced in a relationship between two teenage boys from different dimensions
      who form a strong bond to help each other despite their cultural differences.<br><br>The
