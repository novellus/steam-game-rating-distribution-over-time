The developer is really active on their discord about updates. This starts out as a noir detective, but then goes thriller and horror real fast. So much attention to detail, atmosphere, story, music.. you can tell this game is a labour of love. You really have to hunt around for items too which is cool. A few decent jump scares as well! If you buy it early access, you'll get the additional acts for free as part of the one time payment.","timestamp_created":1609546303,"timestamp_updated":1609546303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559544622898101807","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44fCb4PYCdd7HvwI="}
