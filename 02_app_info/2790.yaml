    review: Bought this years ago, so I can't be too hard on it. Lot of the classics
      in this package like asteroids, centipede ect. Definitely have the right idea
      having so many games on one emulator. Only issues I face is there isn't very
      clear directions on what keys do what. Trying to play the gravitron game for
      instance, it says press start to begin and there is no start button on the keyboard.
      Maybe if I had an atari controller this would be a simple fix, but I don't have
      one, so many of the games I'm unable to play sadly. Second issue is that I am
      playing this on my Tv connected to my computer, and when I press esc to go back
      to the main menu to play a different game, I get black screen that stays that
      way until I ctrl, alt, delete and end program. Not very fun to have to do that
      every time. Could be a resolution problem because of how big the tv is but I've
      had similar issues on my pc screen with this game as well. I hope the mods do
      a little updating to keep these great games alive. I'll have to see about getting
      a compatible atari pc controller for this so I can check out the other games.
      Thanks for the effort!
