    review: 'I know it''s a short game going in, which is cool with me, because I
      spend a lot more on going to a movie which is even shorter and I don''t get
      to play it.


      I like the story.  The characters.  The little joking they do.  It''s got an
      anime feel to it, and not just because of the drawing style.  I''m taking my
      time, exploring, and looking for everything.  Gonna wring my two bucks worth
      from it.


      So far, I do not see any imbalance like one reviewer posted.  Milly is not hitting
      for more damage with her wand than she does with her spells.  That''s not even
      close to true.  I see I''m not the only one who found that review to be wrong.  I''m
      doing okay against the tough lizards, but that might be because I leveled up
      more than a player who tries to rush through.  It might also be because I got
      the game after some patches.


      Mainly, I got the game now because I''m looking forward to the sequel with the
      catgirls.  :)   I''m enjoying it so far.'
