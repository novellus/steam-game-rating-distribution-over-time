    review: "I bought this game in early access thinking, this looks Juvenile AF...Lets\
      \ see where this goes.\n\nWhat I was hoping for was a belligerently oddball\
      \ beat em up game with maybe a story, but off beat characters and a fun weird\
      \ time.  Think along the lines of \"Fat Man\" for the Sega Genesis without nightmarish\
      \ controls. \n\nSo ok, Early Access, random levels... crowd of perpetually spawning\
      \ back guys... basic dudes with extra baddie with some sort of gimmick... cool,\
      \ bare bones but I like where this is almost going... despite not having any\
      \ real options, instructions, point... just a selection between Trailer Park\
      \ Goro or Eyeball...Guy...Man...Thing.\n\nWell, I got it on sale so no biggie,\
      \ maybe this is just the Alpha Release.  Sat on it for a year or so, it gets\
      \ released a few months ago.  \n\nOH BOY! I thought, has there been an update?\
      \ Has someones bizarre pet project come to fruition?\n\nNo.  It's still a mess.\
      \  But now the Mess is far less cute because it's not even hiding behind \"\
      Early Access\" and any of that Middle School charm that I feel nostalgic for\
      \ in my days of watching horrible crap on NewGrounds has left.\n\nAll I have\
      \ is disappointment."
