For real and honest opinions --\n\n-*-*-\n\nI used to love this game when it first came out, as it reminded me of Swords and Potions 2, a game I played for many many years. Cloudcade was scheduled to take over S&P2, but in the end it didn't go through.\n\nThey made this game however, and back then it was a great game. They communicated nicely with their player base and I have even given them many ideas to make gameplay better, including ideas that are implemented in game. I felt appreciated and thus I loved supporting them.\n\nI recently returned to play again, and enjoyed it a lot, until I ran into trouble that wasn't there before. They made changes in game to punish new players and to reward their old. As new player, you get many restrictions that make you even more behind on the older players than you already were.\n\nThey want you to pay for everything, and their ingame packages are extremely expensive. \n\nWhen you start to talk to cloudcade themselves, they are extremely rude and disregard you in every possible way. Sadly, it has begun to feel like an unfair game to new players, and I suggest not getting started on this one. It's a nice game, but extremely unfair and it's only there to fill their pockets with your hardearned cash. \n\nThey even make fun of you if you have more accounts (different platforms) and let you know it is not allowed, even though you just started the game on different places and you can't help you can't link them to the other places. So it's your fault that they don't give you the option to log in from one place on different places. They are funny sometimes. Blame the players and not the company!\n\nNot even worth 1 star. Luckily I don't need to give any with the steam system ^^","timestamp_created":1487869543,"timestamp_updated":1552065661,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697684407234191895","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hNGUr+kCebj0cg=="}
