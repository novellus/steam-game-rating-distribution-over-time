But I really wanted to say something about this game.\n\nI was really pleasantly surprised with it. The characters are cute and likeable, the gameplay is fun, and the story takes some interesting turns. I liked how each area in the game looks different from the last and has different gimmicks. While a familiar loop became evident by the second area, the game kept throwing new things at me for the whole game so I never got bored. And the switching mechanic between the two heroes was cool and more important than just for combat.\n\nThe voice acting did have some moments where the audio was a tad fuzzy, so it kinda took me outta the game when it happens (like maybe 3 times?). Also, some of the puzzles were really hard to figure out and were not obvious at all. But at least each level has this fairy that tells you how to do the puzzles if you talk to her. You just gotta pay a small amount of your ingame money. Most puzzles were okay tho.\n\nPros:\nGood art\nNice variation\nGood story\nFresh gimmicks till the end\nEasy mode and Hard modes appreciated\nSecret Levels\n\nCons:\nAudio a tad fuzzy sometimes\nSome puzzles almost require you to talk to Cloo and pay some ingame currency.\nSome more enemy types would have been nice\n\nOverall I'd happily give this game an 8/10.","timestamp_created":1579224930,"timestamp_updated":1579231757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rIjj2O8CfL2s7AE="}
