      \nPlayers who enjoy political life and who are interested in history will definitely\
      \ enjoy this DLC. Politics DLC provides a new game feature - election.  But\
      \ unlike many other games Arms Race - TCWE game election system works differently.\
      \  Here is the link to the  Cold War Era history - all politicians are real\
      \ people who participated in different important moments during the Cold War\
      \ Era! You can play this and help your leader to be supported by their unique\
      \ experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo simplify the gaming experience the politicians\
      \ are divided in two types of groups. One group is - Liberal and Conservatives.\
      \ Another groups is - Diplomatic, Economic and Militaristic. Those types never\
      \ change their politics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the election process you\
      \ support different leaders. The faces of the leaders they support during ongoing\
      \ elections are shown on the politicians cards. Politicians can change their\
      \ attitude to leaders from time to time but they never change their party (Liberal,\
      \ Conservatives, Diplomatic, Economic, Militaristic). During elections you need\
      \ to choose three politicians that support the same leader ( one politician\
      \ per each group - Diplomatic, Economic and Militaristic). Once it is done you\
      \ can vote for this leader and form a new government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom\
      \ the very beginning of the game, the election capacity for politicians is limited\
      \ to three open slots. You need to provide reforms and make changes in the constitution\
      \ to be able to open new slots. As more slots are open there are different possibilities\
      \ for a better choice during the election for both - leaders and politics. But\
      \ reforms are not easy. Be careful to face negative Global Consequences when\
      \ you make big changes inside of your country. Reforms and changes of constitution\
      \ can be done only during elections ( as a promise of the new government ).<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother unpleasant situation can happen if you decide to vote\
      \ for the same leader twice in a roll. It will bring Stagnation to your country\
      \ and as a result one negative Global Consequence. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPoliticians\
      \ are influential people in government, even if they work for the President\
      \ of the USA or the Prime Minister of the USSR they influence the leaders. Politicians\
      \ affiliation to Liberal or Conservative mind thinking make changes to the leader\
      \ platform. If during the election you chose three Liberal politicians your\
      \ leaders platform will be - Economic. If all three leaders are Conservative\
      \ your leaders platform will be - Militaristic. If there is a mix of Liberals\
      \ and Conservatives in your government the platform of your leader will be -\

    review: 'Politics does not work. The random nature of the possible advisors would
      be fine, except you have to have all 3 advisors match to the same president.
      That breaks the system and creates the very common situation of being forced
      into picking the president. There is only a choice at the start of the game,
      otherwise you will be forced into picking the one canidate that you have three
      advisors for. The worst case is when the only president with 3 advisors is the
      old one so you are forced to eat a stagnant government. Hopefully it was reagan
      or gorbachev so that you can fix the global consequence lost.


      The worst part is that I am unsure if the AI actually needs to play by the politics
      rules. The issues with this system could be easily fixed by only needing a majority
      of advisors to support a canidate. The current system has little basis in real
      life and does not allow any player choice.'
