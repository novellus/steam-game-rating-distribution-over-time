The one level I played was small and felt like cs_office.\nThis is indeed an arena shooter just like the description says. I expected too much of it.\n\nThe level/arena borders are defined by a kill-zone just like you would encounter in other games where you shall not leave the map area.\nI thought it would be a bit bigger and openworld and generally more epic and sometimes players would meet and PvP each other. And sometimes people would hide in Asteroids. But its just small and made for quick fights.\n\nNot for me.\nOn the other hand, it is a perfect small space shooter if someone really needs one. So if you need this kind of game get it and see my review as a recommendation.\n\nUnfortunately this game concept does not work for me...\nCould not refund because purchase was too long ago and I could not test it earlier.","timestamp_created":1588665690,"timestamp_updated":1588665690,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455549418926239014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+dT28fECdI/YhQI="}
