    about_the_game: The Wizard is back, and it's better than ever! Enjoy this new
      and improved edition of the beloved turn-based dungeon puzzler, with its unique
      spell casting system, expanded levels and story, and the features people have
      long been asking for!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1275600/extras/wizhard-opt.gif?t=1606568186"
      /><br><br>Step into the robe Kevin, the exceptionally handsome but woefully
      inattentive wizardry student, whose gorgeous face has just been stolen. Follow
      the thief through the dangerous dungeons beneath the academy, encounter mythical
      monsters, and learn powerful magic along the way! You'll find many an opportunity
      to hone and upgrade your abilities to your individual play style, but be wary!
      Without a well-considered plan of action, this goofy little apprentice won't
      make it very far...<br><br>With a heavy emphasis on strategy, The Wizard challenges
      its players to plan their moves carefully, upgrade their spells strategically,
      and use the environment to their advantage to make it through its mazes unscathed.
