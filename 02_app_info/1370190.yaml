    about_the_game: "The 17 tracks in the game combine two distinct and original musical\
      \ identities. On the one hand, the British <strong>Roly Porter </strong>surrounds\
      \ us with his powerful and meticulous electronic ambiences, through a mix of\
      \ intriguing classical instruments and distorted synthesizers. These futuristic,\
      \ mysterious and sometimes rough sounds are complemented by the eclectic and\
      \ wild punk rock of the Japanese all-girl trio <strong>TsuShiMaMiRe</strong>.<br><br>This\
      \ musical pairing enhances the <strong>Paper Beast </strong>experience by making\
      \ it even more captivating and surreal, giving the impression of exploring a\
      \ space that\u2019s truly out of this world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Composers</h2><br>Roly\
      \ Porter, composer and sound designer from the art scene in Bristol, England,\
      \ has played a major role in shaping the sound of <strong>Paper Beast</strong>.<br>His\
      \ live performances have been produced all over the world and are often made\
      \ in collaboration with video maker Marcel Weber.\_<br><br>Epitomising the Japanese\
      \ underground alternative art punk scene, TsuShiMaMiRe is a  trio (Mari Kono,\
      \ Yayoi Tsushima and Maiko Takagi) who draw on a wide variety of musical styles,\
      \ such as trash punk and jazz. The <strong>Paper Beast </strong>original soundtrack\
      \ features its well-known title \u201CSpeedy Wonder\u201D as well as two new\
      \ tracks composed exclusively for the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Eric Chahi Statement</h2><br><i>&quot;I\

      \ for the mystical, interstellar music he has created. The ambient music gives\
      \ the Paper Beast universe sounds that are electro, metallic and lunar all at\
      \ the same time. There is a lot of magnetism in his music.<br>In TsuShiMaMiRe\
      \ we find a common energy that expresses the bizarre colorful side of Paper\

      \ the games two themes: data and life.&quot;</i>"
