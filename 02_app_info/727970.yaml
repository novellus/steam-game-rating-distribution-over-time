    about_the_game: Welcome to <strong>Cosmic Trail</strong>, a skill-based 3D platformer.<br><br>Take
      control of a little spaceship that needs to get to the portal at the end of
      each trail in only 32 seconds. In each trail you'll have to use the jump and
      turbo impulse capabilities of your ship to be able to traverse the obstacles.
      You have infinite retries and will respawn immediately on death (yes, it's that
      kind of game). <br><br>This game started as a tribute to an classic MS-DOS game,
      but as the development progressed it became its own thing. The design is based
      on having shorter and denser levels for a more challenging experience.<br><br>The
      game was made with our own game engine, RoyalLib3, programmed in C++ and OpenGL,
      and uses our voxel rendering technology with custom shaders for the lighting
      and ambient occlusion.<br><br>Features:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>20 levels
      (trails) to master. From the simpler ones, for learning the basics, up to incredible
      challenges to conquer.<br></li><li>Each level has its own mechanical design,
      all levels are different, no two levels feel similar, there is no filler.<br></li><li>Easy
      to play, hard to master.<br></li><li>Play with your keyboard or gamepad (compatible
      with XB, PS and NSW gamepads).<br></li><li>Compete with the world in the Steam
      Leaderboards. Try to beat the best times!<br></li><li>Compatible with high refresh
      rate monitors (like GSync).</li></ul><br>I hope you enjoy the game. :)
