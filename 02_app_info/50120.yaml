    review: 'basically a fun, intense pitching sim game...fun for baseball fans. play
      career mode as a pitcher


      + pitching in the 9th, up by one with two runners in scoring position, is about
      as exciting as you hope it would be

      - roster updates don''t seem to work

      - batting is too difficlut and base running is a bit awkward (hence playing
      the pitching career instead)


      score = 3.5/5'
