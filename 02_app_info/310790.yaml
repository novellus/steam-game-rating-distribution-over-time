    review: 'Geometry Wars 3 is the pinnacle of twin-stick arcade shooters - nothing
      else I''ve played in the genre has managed to live up to the high bar it sets.
      Playing it requires such intense focus, swift reflexes, and an almost psychic
      level of intuition that it puts you in a trance-like state which is enhanced
      by the surreal atmosphere of the liquid-fluid metamorphoses of the stages, each
      shaped in fantastical ways and littered with vividly colored shapes that burn
      their way into your brain and remain visible behind your eyelids long after
      you''ve finished playing.


      I''ve been a fan of Geometry Wars since it began as a mini-game within Project
      Gotham Racing 4 in 2007. I''ve watched it grow, each iteration improving on
      its core premise, and Geometry Wars 3 is leagues ahead of its predecessors as
      well as its peers. The production values are top-notch and the gameplay is finely
      tuned and addictive & varied enough to keep you playing for hours and continue
      coming back to it. From the gorgeous presentation to the unique & psychedelic
      level designs to the upgradable special abilities to choose from (each changing
      how you approach a stage and its enemies), it''s clear the developers put a
      lot of time & effort into this. What impressed me most, however, were the variations
      on the basic types of gameplay modes and how they translate over to 3 dimensions.
      There are still flat-surfaced 2D levels, but on the 3D stages, you (and your
      enemies, the types and behaviors of which are vast) retain command of the entire
      surface which is shaped in creative ways and sometimes covered with strategically
      placed walls and interactive objects. This opens up worlds of new possibilities
      which the developers are constantly exploring. A recent update (in which "Evolved"
      was added to the game''s subtitle) introduced an entirely new set of levels
      with multiple modes - an expansion easily worth $15, completely free. With the
      attention to detail and sheer amount of content continually being added upon,
      you really get the feeling that this is a labor of love for the folks at Lucid
      Games.


      A common complaint I''ve noticed is that the game is too difficult. When I first
      started playing this, I agreed that it was insanely hard and the learning curve
      too steep, but after spending a few hours with it, I felt increasingly comfortable
      and began to advance quite quickly through the adventure mode. A few days later,
      I revisited those early stages I initially had so much trouble with and wound
      up getting the full 3 star score on all of them with relative ease. It''s true
      that the amount of enemies on screen at any given time and the frenetic pace
      at which the game operates can be overwhelming (as can the cheesy techno soundtrack),
      but it is not impossible. If you have decent hand-eye coordination and a twin-stick
      controller (and I must stress how important it is to use a modern, dual analog
      stick controller for this), you''ll get the hang of it, and this is a game most
      definitely worth getting the hang of. [b]A+[/b] - sublime & genre-defining.'
