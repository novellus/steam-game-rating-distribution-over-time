It is.  You have three different kinds of weapons to knock down or destroy what seems like a lot of building levels.  I haven't seen it all since later levels need to be unlocked by completing the levels before them.  It's a great pick up and play for a few minutes game.  Not much else to say about it.  I'd say it's worth 20$ and a nice game to get especially for friends when they stop by.  I'm going to be going back to this game instead of the lab whenever I feel like knocking down stuff.\n\nMy only issue would be the controls for the htc vive.  I couldn't find a way to change them in game.  Not that annoying, but the mine detonation is the same pad circle thing that turns you a few degrees in game.  Otherwise the game looks decently polished.","timestamp_created":1571879361,"timestamp_updated":1571879361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598540186882019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1571948431,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review. I will look into better mapping for the Vive controllers as soon as possible."}],"cursor":"AoJ4nvPT/e0CeP/P1AE="}
