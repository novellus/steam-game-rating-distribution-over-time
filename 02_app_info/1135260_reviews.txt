While the main story takes its time telling the history of the world chapter by chapter, I found I enjoyed the missions and world building it has. This stormy world has an eerie ambience that I don't see often in other games, and absolutely love. \n As far as how the falcons handle, I used a ps4 controller, and found no issues with the flight controls.","timestamp_created":1610106279,"timestamp_updated":1610106279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xYL08PYCfrTCwQI="}
