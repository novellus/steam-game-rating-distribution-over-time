    review: "[h1]When you close your eyes you can feel the heat of the desert or the\
      \ depth of the dungeons in SteamWorld Dig 2..[/h1]\n\nEl Huervo and Pelle Cahndlerby\
      \ created with the Soundtrack of SteamWorld Dig 2 (SWD2) something special where\
      \ you many times will just stop what you are doing in the Game and then just\
      \ listen to the current track that is playing.\n\nMay it be [b]Desert Calling[/b]\
      \ or [b]New Heights in El Machino[/b] the Soundtrack of SWD2 has it's funky\
      \ and slow Tracks that never do really feel out of place but somehow always\
      \ connected to the Game in a way I can`t really describe.\n\nTracks like [b]Backtrack\
      \ to Guidance[/b] start slow and then become in the end faster where you many\
      \ times notice that you are trying to adapt your Gameplay Style to the tempo\
      \ of the current track.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nThe Soundtrack is available\
      \ in the MP-3 (128 kBit/s Bitrate) and Wave (1411 kBit/s Bitrate) Format on\
      \ Steam with an Album artwork in 1000x1000 with an 96 dpi.\n\nThe tracks I liked\
      \ the most: [b]Precipice[/b] & [b]Light of Guidance[/b] - I don\xB4t even know\
      \ why but the first moment i have heard those two tracks in the Game it just\
      \ made click and I loved them. It was just love from the first note. The SteamWorld\
      \ Dig 2 is also available on [url=https://imageform.bandcamp.com/releases]Bandcamp[/url]\
      \ in MP-3/FLAC/Wave/...\n\nThe tracks I like the least: [b]Bad to Worse[/b]\
      \ & [b]Oh Dorothy (Extended Main Theme)[/b] - Those two tracks. I can`t even\
      \ listen to them even once anylonger before I fast forward them when i hear\
      \ through the Soundtrack or turn the music off in the Game till they pass. While\
      \ [b]Dorothy's Theme (SWD2 Main Theme)[/b] was just fine the Extended Main Theme\
      \ is just plain and simple over the top and I can only guess that in the end\
      \ another Track was for the Credits needed and it should be done in a day or\
      \ less and the result is what we have listen to.\n\nOverall I don\xB4t regret\
      \ buying the Soundtrack on Steam also it would have been nice if we would get\
      \ instead the Tracks in an lossless format like FLAC instead of Wave.\n\nStill\
      \ the SteamWorld Dig 2 Soundtrack is as smooth and as enjoyable as I had hoped\
      \ it would turn out to be and therefore I can give it a very strong...\n\n[b]Thumbs\
      \ Up[/b]\n\nThat\xB4s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-)\n"
