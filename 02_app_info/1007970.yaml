    about_the_game: This Side is a co-op roguelike survival horror game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Be
      Aware</h2>The game is currently on Early Access version so please be patient
      and if you find someting that you think we could improve or need to be fixed
      don't be shy and lets us know here on Steam or even on our social media!<h2
      class="bb_tag">The History</h2>At this current version This Side it's about
      two friends that need help each other to find a way out of a dangerous place.
      In the future we aim to increase the amount of information about the place and
      tells to the players whats happens there.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><h2
      class="bb_tag">Co-Op </h2><br>We aim for This Side to be a true co-operative
      experience where both players need to help each other to finish the game. <br>The
      game has two play sides Inside and Outside the mines.<br><br><strong>Inside
      the Mines</strong><br>Inside the mine the player faces the hazardous environment
      of a abandoned mine. <br>For now we get the cave collapsing areas, so the player
      need to keep moving while the caves collapses over his head.<br>Our goal with
      the final experience its to make its struggling and visceral like a real survival
      experience inside a confusing and dangerous place.<br><br><strong>Outside the
      Mines</strong><br>Outside the player needs to find its way to help his friend
      by controlling the environment inside the mines while it faces his own problems.<br>At
      the current version the player need to find some electric components and use
      them to open some water control gates so he can release his friend.<br>Our goal
      with the final experience its to make frightening by the  need for help while
      one player faces the struggle inside the mines he put his pain on his friend
      shoulders.<br><br><strong>Survival</strong><br>Both player in the future will
      have survival mechanics based on his own environment the idea behind that its
      not to flood the player by resources administration bur make the sense of surviving
      more believable. At the same time we aim to make the survival experience more
      co-operative.<h2 class="bb_tag">Roguelike</h2>Every aspect in the game is being
      designed to be roguelike. We aim that all play through to be a new and different
      experience. Every time we start to talk about a new mechanic e talk about how
      it can be done procedurally. <br><br>In this version we created a fully procedural
      cave that fits most of our game design needs so every time you play you will
      find a new cave. The electrical components and the Water control gates are procedural
      too.<h2 class="bb_tag">Single Player</h2> In this version the player plays with
      both sides but we aim to make more like a &quot;single player&quot;  feeling
      of our multiplayer core.<br>In the future the player will chose which side he
      want to play and will help or be helped by an AI. We're no aimomg for a training
      or tutorial mode it will be more  like a Hardcore gameplay mode.<br><br><img
