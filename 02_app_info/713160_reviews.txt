Beat it in about 7 hours with 73% completion.  Definitely kept my interest the whole time.  Difficulty felt just right.  Most bosses took 3-5 tries, although with one boss (the library one) I ended  up having to backtrack and search for some more health/weapon upgrades in order to beat it.  Map layout was solid and I was able to figure out where to go pretty easily.  Would definitely recommend to any metroidvania fans","timestamp_created":1608942439,"timestamp_updated":1608942439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pamczvYCfoKcvQI="}
