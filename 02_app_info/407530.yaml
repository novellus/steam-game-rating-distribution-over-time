    review: 'ARK: Survival Evolved is totally worth it for both single-player and
      multiplayer experiences. People who enjoy survival games will enjoy a game much
      less stressful than Rust, along with a crazy amount of dinosaurs. If you don''t
      enjoy survival type games, then you won''t like ARK.'
