It's one of the first RPGs I've ever played, and beaten.  I got it several years ago back when literally nobody had heard of the game - which, let's be real here, that's *still* true even to this day.  But that's a shame, because it really is a cool, mysterious, great game with intriguing story, few but endearing characters, wonderful pixelated graphics, and challenging fights all throughout, from Ry the Dark Warden 30 seconds in to [spoiler] Rios the Creator [/spoiler] at the end.\n\nYou can play as one of several different races, from the traditional dwarves, elves, and humans, to more original ones, such as the aquatic race of the  Ghroulians or the mystical automatons called Cogsmen (I think that's what they're called? Idk it's been awhile since I played).  Each race comes with a special ability that helps you out in some way throughout the game, though I'm gonna be honest, some abilities are straight-up better than others.  For example, as a Ghroulian, you start the game with the ability to swim, which you would otherwise get around halfway-ish into the game.  It nets you some cool stuff that you wouldn't get until later, but once you hit the point you'd normally get that power, it becomes obselete.  \n\nWhat's not obselete, though, is the gameplay and story.  The story is very mysterious, and you never really put the whole thing together.  You can figure out most of it through item  descriptions and character dialogue, and the final words of the now-deceased souls you collect on your adventure.  The game is quite like Dark Souls in this and other ways, or so I've heard.  It features many deities, ancient castles and other locations, temples, and other such things.  Magic is quite prevalent, allowing you to use all sorts of runic spells to blast away your foes.\n\nWhich brings me to combat, which is pretty cool.  You get two hands, which you can use to either wield a pair of one-handed weapons or a single two-handed weapon.  You can dodge-roll, parry, jump backwards, sprint, and do other fancy maneuvers.  Combo these with powerful weapons and spells to get the edge on your enemies.\n\nThe bosses are pretty hard, especially the ones not directly in your path (another Dark Souls trait).  But I love the challenge, and have beaten every boss multiple times over.\n\nSo yeah, love EPOCH, it's got awesome artwork, interesting story, good combat, all the stuff you could want out of an RPG.  Lots of bugs, though, which is what makes me give it an 8.5/10\n\nP.S. DON'T waste your time with the successor, Nother.  It's super laggy, even on a decent computer, and the story makes NO sense.  Graphics are bad too.","timestamp_created":1606872498,"timestamp_updated":1606872498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Y/EkPYCeMLStgI="}
