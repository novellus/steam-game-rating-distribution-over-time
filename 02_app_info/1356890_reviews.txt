There aren't even any instructions... I beat the first level and then ran over the exit over and again; each time the exit would teleport to a new location. I only accidentally bumped a shoulder button on my controller, which then made the character do a dash and the exit activated. It's like, once you clear a level of enemies, why doesn't just walking over the exit end the level? This game is sooooo weak and needs an untold amount of work to be even classified as a game... it's not really a game... it's more like a student's beginner project.\n\nNormally if I pay under $1 for a game I just let the developer keep the money, even if I don't like the game. But here, this isn't even a good-faith effort to make a fun game, it's some beginner project that sucks in every way possible. I requested a refund.","timestamp_created":1599251167,"timestamp_updated":1599251167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543778777122497559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48YazrfQCcaTnnwI="}
