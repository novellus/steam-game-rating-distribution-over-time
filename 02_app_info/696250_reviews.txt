This one has crafting very similar to The Forest or Green Hell. It's rough around the edges even though it has been in Early Access almost 3 years. Another indie developer that uses Google Translate to turn his game into English.\n\nPros: Good crafting, decent status tracking, decent graphics, male or female choice, no stupid zombies or infected, nice random loot washed up in chests near the shore.\nCons: illogical supplies (like almost no sticks in a forest), massive clipping on clothing, stuff you build disappears, items on the ground disappear, saved games don't track near enough data.","timestamp_created":1597500185,"timestamp_updated":1598051625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4gpXTifQCdf3PmwI="}
