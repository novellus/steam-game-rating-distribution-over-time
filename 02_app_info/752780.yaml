    review: 'There is basically nothing to recommend this game. It might''ve been
      interesting if stapled to its successor, [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/752780]W4RR-i/o-RS:
      Descent[/url][/i], as an additional mode that integrated with the gameplay in
      that game. But here it is, exactly as the Store description states: a nearly
      zero-player game that almost plays itself. This is not some secret game hiding
      behind a bland listing. It is exactly what it says on the tin.


      I did end up pasting hundreds of commands (with line breaks) into the terminal
      window and watching the list of Warriors live, fight, advance, and die. It''s
      certainly a way to quickly demonstrate to oneself how easily the human mind
      can spin a narrative from the output of a weighted random number generator (to
      borrow from xkcd #904). But once I got all of the achievements, I immediately
      uninstalled this game.


      Don''t bother with it.'
