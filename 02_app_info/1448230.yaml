    about_the_game: '<i>Developed by a single person and based on an RPG book written
      by him! Set in a huge open world, Avalom: Ancient Heroes presents a rewarding
      action combat experience. Players embark on an epic adventure in a rich and
      alive world with their AI companions. In a world where mortals and gods coexist
      and live on the same plane of existence! Interpret and be whatever you want
      in this endless journey where anything can happen! Remember you are free and
      can live however you want without any linear story to follow, you are the one
      who tells your own story!</i><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1448230/extras/Intro.jpg?t=1607655985"
      /><br><br> *<strong>Fascinating narrative driven by your choices - You don''t
      just decide to live freely in the world of Avalom, you make important decisions
      that change the future. Each choice has its weight, and its actions can lead
      to several results. Avalom is a highly personalized journey where a false move
      can lead to a series of events that alter even physical aspects of the world,
      making you and your allies truly unique.</strong><br><br> *<strong>An Immense
      World to be Discovered - The world of Avalom has never been so large and so
      detailed. It is completely open and ready to be explored. Discover the enemy
      that is ready to act. Reveal hidden caves full of lurking creatures. Avalom
      is vast and dangerous, but unraveling its secrets can mean the difference between
      victory and defeat.</strong><br><br>* <strong>Intense and strategic combat -
      There is no wrong way to play Avalom: Ancestral Heroes, except in which you
      die. Fortunately, you can build characters with a giant skill tree to build
      unique characters on.</strong>'
