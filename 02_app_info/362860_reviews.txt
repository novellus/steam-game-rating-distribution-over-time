Let's start with the good stuff: the mic and audio recorder are a great way for building a tense and mysterious atmosphere; I also found voice acting well made, great sound design and good music too. As for the graphics, they're crude but I personally don't mind, I actually think it suits the genre. Now the bad stuff: the overall usability, controls, world interactions and puzzles are very very very rough, and on top of this I experienced minor but frequent and very annoying bugs. I almost felt the development was rushed and not tested properly. I know it's an indie and I shouldn't be harsh, but for me these are central aspects in a game. If you value tense atmosphere and don't mind an unpolished gameplay, then you might enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1609315599,"timestamp_updated":1609315599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qeir2fYCf+7avgI="}
