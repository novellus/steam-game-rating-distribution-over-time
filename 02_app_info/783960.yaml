      \ to a world of violence, war, and darkness. The story is draws on \u201COne\
      \ Thousand and One Nights\u201D and is a mystical-love narrative based on the\
      \ esoteric Eastern culture. In the City of Sun, playing instruments has been\
      \ forbidden and darkness has come to life. Shahrdad Shah, The king of the City\
      \ of Sun, has gone to a magical sleep by the betrayal of his vizier. However,\

      \ the instrument and burning love. The vizier gets wise to it, breaks the strings,\
      \ and calls Shahbaz a traitor. That\u2019s when Shahbaz escapes from the Land\
      \ of Sun with the help of his wife in hope of fixing the instrument. Instructed\
      \ by the Goddess of Jungle, he realizes that he can mend the instrument strings\
      \ in the land of Water. Thus begins his journey; a journey which is the same\
      \ as the evolution of man in the abyss of love. Shahbaz crosses across several\
      \ lands until he finally reaches the Land of Water. But, this land is bewitched\
      \ by a dark spell. After braking its spell, Shahbaz has to return to the gloomy\

      \ of Jungle from the dark spell and return to his hand with its help. Shahbaz\
      \ needs to play for his father, Shahrdad Shah, to remove the spell from him.\
