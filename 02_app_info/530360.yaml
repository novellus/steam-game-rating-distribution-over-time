      travel, but finally, the young mage Kymil arrives at his destination.<br><br>He's
      a Cyromancer - a spellcaster who wields the power of ice to smite down his enemies.
      Kymil learned how to harness his power thanks to his uncle, a well-renowned
      adventurer who hunted down treasure on every corner of the continent.<br><br>But
      his uncle was murdered in his home by an unknown assailant, and Kymil is driven
      to uncover the mystery behind his death. The only clue he has is an unfinished
      entry in his uncle's notes about a mysterious cathedral in the middle of the
      sprawling Dead Plains...<br><br>When he arrives at the cathedral, Kymil has
      no idea what he's searching for or where to go. But something in him presses
      him forward, and he's determined to figure out the cathedral's secrets, no matter
      how dire the cost.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>125,000

      class="bb_tag">About:</h2><br>Requiescence is a visual novel - a 2D narrative-based
      game that presents the user with important choices to alter the story's path.
      Primarily a story of action and adventure, Requiescence features three prominent
      romance routes that significantly change the later portions of the game.<br><br>The
      game is also a BL (boy's love) game, which means both the main character and
      the love interests are male.<br><br>If you're familiar with Nitro+CHiRAL games
      (Togainu no Chi, Lamento, DRAMAtical Murder, Sweet Pool), then you know how
      amazing a story can become when you mingle an epic adventure with intricate
      character relationships. Requiescence is heavily inspired by these games and
      aims for a similar style, while still putting a fresh twist on the BL genre.

    review: "This VN builds up slowly but stick with it.  I almost gave up after seemingly\
      \ endless dreary backgrounds and repetitive tunnel shots without a sense of\
      \ a plot but I'm glad I persisted.  If you buy the game here on Steam, there's\
      \ a pop up when you launch that game.  Use that URL on your phone to create\
      \ an Itch.io account.  From there you can download a Windows copy of the R18+\
      \ version of this game.  Or an Android one if you're into squinting at a 6\"\
      \ screen.  Very hot love scenes that flesh out (no pun intended) the story and\
      \ the relationships even more.  Something seems to be missing if you read through\
      \ the PG13 one first time around like I did.  Sex always complicates things,\
      \ doesn't it?  :)  \n\nOnce the main characters are all assembled, like Your\
      \ Dry Delight and Highway Blossoms, their stories pull you in.  There are 3\
      \ different romance branches and you have to complete the first 2 to get to\
      \ the 3rd, but each one is fully worthwhile exploring.  Each man has his own\
      \ demons (ironic to say that for this particular novel) and you as the MC have\
      \ the ability to help them through it.  I was impressed by the sophistication\
      \ of the wisdom each character had to add to the relationship with the MC as\
      \ well.  Kudos to the devs for such thoughtful story telling!  \n\nThe final\
      \ story is the most complex, the longest to finish and in its way, the most\
      \ rewarding.  But that seems fitting because this is a very long VN (17 hours\
      \ of play for me) overall and the final ending is the one that is most complete\
      \ in realizing the goals of the MC and his future.\n\nSo wish Argent would keep\
      \ making BL VN!!"
