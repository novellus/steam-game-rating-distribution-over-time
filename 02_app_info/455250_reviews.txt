I understand that games need to be financed and receive income to be successful, but I wish that more Christian games like Adam Venture would be sold on the market.  They need to be advertised on Christian TV sites like Yippee and Pure Flix- I think if more Christians knew about this, these games would get more coverage.  \n\nThe average gamer on Steam is an unbeliever who wants nothing more than to fulfill their lusts for violence, vulgarity, deceit, and sexual content. I know, because I was one of them. \n After Jesus Christ came into my life, I realized how sinful I was and what I deserve is eternal hell when I look at the Ten Commandments.  I understood that God is Holy and Just, and therefore will NEVER let someone who loved, ignored, and played down their grievous offense into Eternal Life.  It would be worse than a mass murderer being taken to court and pretending like he did nothing wrong! The look of shock on his face when the Just Judge pronounces life in prison and/or the death sentence!\nThe good news, or Gospel, is this: Jesus Christ is God, came to Earth as a man, lived a sinless life although tempted in every way... endured our struggles, felt our emotion, and did many great miracles of healing and even raised people from the dead!  However, none of that would really matter to any of us unless He didn't fulfill His mission, for He would be relegated to a footnote of history- on the list of good teachers who came and died.  \nBut He did fulfill His mission! Because the ruling class thought of Him as blasphemer (because He claimed to be one with God) they turned Him over to the roman authorities so they could punish Him.. and punish they did!  He was shamed in front of a court, spat on, beaten, scourged by roman flagrum, then paraded down the street carrying a piece of wood. He would be nailed to it outside the city and left for dead- a slow agonizing death that could take days.  He could have saved Himself easily, but His mission was to take upon Himself the sins of all who believe, so that our death sentence could be commuted..  God will not die, for He is eternal- and after he endured death for us, raised Himself up on the 3rd day! The purpose: to pay the cost of our sins, for we cannot pay for them ourselves.","timestamp_created":1609341761,"timestamp_updated":1609341761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43s6P2vYCePLmvgI="}
