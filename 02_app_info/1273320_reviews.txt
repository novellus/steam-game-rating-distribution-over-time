Ad in the fact that when you are caught, you are returned to the last safe platform you touched (rather than just dropped), and a single close encounter with an enemy can undo all your progress. If you lose all your lives, you also need to return to the very beginning of the game's map.\n\nJump height is also always the same, which makes this platformer very difficult to complete, especially in one room where 'the floor is lava', the platforms are moving, you having flying enemies with the worst hit boxes in the game, and the last safe platform you touch is at the very beginning of the room. Its damn-near impossible to complete, and not because the mechanics are challenging, they're just awkward and frustrating.\n\nThe dev can keep my money, but I hope the continue to refine the game.","timestamp_created":1608073488,"timestamp_updated":1608073488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6MSptPYCe+HHugI="}
