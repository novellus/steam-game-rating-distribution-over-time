      Comments From the Developer:</strong></h2><br>The first concepts for Aspiring
      Light came almost four years ago when I was just in high school. After playing
      just one singular AAA visual novel, young me had the bright idea of making his
      own, give or take a couple of A''s. And to be quite frank, it was completely
      different than what it''s evolved into today. To put it in light (lol) terms,
      I am so effing glad I failed at earlier attempts at compiling this story, because
      now I can see the plot and dialogue were so cringe-worthy back then that it
      would probably have completely ruined all of my future prospects entering this
      niche industry. I had tried to do everything by myself, but that proved to be
      more than I could handle. But it wasn''t until last summer of 2019 where I had
      finally sat down and written a finished draft of the story. That too was pretty
      terrible, but over time I''ve been able to improve it. Perhaps outside of my
      scope, it''s still cringe-worthy. That''s not for me to say, but rather for
      the wonderful community to bash me on like a dominatrix. But nonetheless, I
      think it''s something I can say with confidence, I tried my best with.<br><br>The
      total budget was about $4000 USD, which is frankly almost double of what I was
      hoping when I started, but I''m clearly not the type of person that''s fiscally
      responsible. But regardless, I decided to make this game free to play simply
      because...firstly, I''d like more people to try it out. And frankly, I know
      there''s no worse feeling than spending money on a game you turn out disliking.
      That''s why <i>Aspiring Light</i> is opting rather for a &quot;play before you
      pay&quot; monetization model, as well as an &quot;implicitly shill for money
      by feigning generosity&quot; model. Afterward, if you enjoy the game and are
      feeling generous, your contributions to help me break even, and maybe even fund
      future projects, are greatly appreciated. But in all seriousness, having the
      game up and being played by others is already an honor. And also terrifying.<br><br>I''m
      hoping you will enjoy the experience. And I''m hoping that this is just the
      first of many stories I''ll be able to share with the world.<br><br>Be on the
      lookout for Aspiring Light: Gold Edition, coming soon! For just the low price
      of $25 USD, you will receive a golden menu screen! And literally nothing else!
      Now that''s predatory monetization!<br><br>-JY_2000, Developer'
