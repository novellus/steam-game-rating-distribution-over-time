The controls are sloppy, hard to manage, to the point where I had to give it up. If you can't even get your basics right, there's no point.\n\nThe 3kliksphilip music is embedded in my head, but when you have runs that last 15 seconds and the song resets every run, it gets annoting real fast.\n\nThis is just straight up a bad score attack game, unfortunately.","timestamp_created":1569637537,"timestamp_updated":1569637537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505165696144104004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1569710351,"developer_response":"Thanks for the honest review :)\n\nAn actual quality re-make is on the horizon, so stay tuned."}],"cursor":"AoJ4zoLsuu0Ccbv/0gE="}
