    review: 'Shop-n-Spree provides an interesting variation on time-management games.
      Instead of a long linear system of similar sub-levels to beat sequentially (3.1,
      3.2, 3.3, etc.), each level (mall) contains fewer sub-levels (stores) that need
      to be unlocked and repeated at the player''s discretion to earn advancement
      points. This could easily be repetitive with an average time-management game
      with little item diversity, but this game has many dozens of distinct items
      and even requires the player combine items to make new ones. Kudos to their
      item artists for not being lazy!


      As time-management games go, Shop-n-Spree is on the easier side because the
      customers are very patient. It''s a excellent entry-level game into the genre,
      but skilled players will probably crush it. The mini-games are infinitely repeatable
      to build up a "magic box" buff that can be used in any store, again being very
      kind to the player.


      One negative - there are restocking cards with pictures of the items next to
      the actual items. When gathering combos, it is too easy to accidentally pick
      up the picture of the item, rather than the item, especially if the items are
      blue like the cards. If the restock cards could only have been right-clicked,
      it would have been less annoying.


      One moment of gameplay struck me as particularly funny - at the America mall,
      a customer asked to put a gift bow on a 2-liter bottle of soda.'
