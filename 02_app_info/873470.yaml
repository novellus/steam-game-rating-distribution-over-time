    review: 'Right off the bat, this is a fairly niche game, and I made the mistake
      of only doing one or 2 of the tutorial, scenarios, I guess I would call them,
      before deciding that I could hop right in. That wasn''t really a wise decision,
      but it kind of gave me a general idea of how things worked so that I could play
      around a little more, and I failed. The next thing I did was hop into another
      tutorial and voila, I had to do be doing something right or else I wouldn''t
      get to the next bits. Once I got there, I could manage.


      Pros:

      +It''s a different concept. Imagine a RTS style, but without raising an army,
      and with having to balance needs, kind of like a SimCity, or Civ game.

      +It''s fast paced; you see the effects from your actions pretty much immediately.

      +Game world seeding.

      +Once you learn how it works, you can jump right in.


      Cons:

      -The GUI isn''t really the best when you''re starting out. You adapt to it and
      learn where things are really quickly, and what to watch for.


      Other thoughts:

      There''s no save function, but, that I think that would be due to the teams
      plan to make it primarily a multiplayer game. I''m going to give them a pass
      on that one. I haven''t yet tried the multiplayer aspect of it, so I''m not
      sure how that works, but I''d imagine it would be fun, if you had the right
      crowd of people.


      All in all, it''s a type of game that I enjoy, and if I knew someone that likes
      that type, I would let them know about this one. It''s definitely a good value
      for what I paid, and I suspect that I''ll be playing more of it in the future.'
