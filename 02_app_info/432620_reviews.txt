My roommate and I played this for a solid half hour just battling back and forth.  Quite an awesome concept and fun to play; I'd like to try this out when I get 4 people over.\nI think this game deserves more attention than it has.\nI hope that as more people get steam links, this game takes off.\nIt's very well polished as well; thanks for making this.","timestamp_created":1499578356,"timestamp_updated":1499578356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkrr1kt0Cf4ayfw=="}
