Bought it, launched for 12mins, exited, submitted a refund request, checked activity page and suddenly saw I earned free 5,000 achievements of the same type. BAD game, might as well find yourself a free browser trivia game. I recommend FunTrivia.com.\n\nTIP: If you bought this game intentionally to cheat your achievement, REFUND IT IMMEDIATELY. Because i had tried every possible way to DELETE this 5K achievements and I just cant get rid of it. I HATE IT. Ruined my legit hard work for my achievements and make me seem like a cheater. I'm not. REFUND IT, GET UR MONEY BACK AND KEEP THE ACHIEVEMENTS, if thats what you're after. Steam should not allow this kind of transactions in their store.","timestamp_created":1592771091,"timestamp_updated":1593258582,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/5Pn+vICc/iyjwI="}
