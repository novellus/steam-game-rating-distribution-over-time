    about_the_game: "Told with courageous humor and unflinching candor, cancerpants\
      \ tells the story of spirited and self-aware 36-year-old Austinite Rochelle\
      \ \u201CRo\u201D Poulson\u2019s battle to stay strong after an unexpected diagnosis\
      \ of stage III breast cancer. Unfolding in intimate diary style cancerpants\
      \ charts Ro and her partner Julie\u2019s emotional odyssey as they engage their\
      \ entire circle of friends, family and local community to aid Ro\u2019s quest\
      \ to find meaning, life enrichment and personal growth. Ro refuses to be \u201C\
      just a body,\u201D and throughout the film she demonstrates how to sustain a\
      \ constructively fighting spirit within the experience of serious illness. We\
      \ watch her undergo chemo, a (failed) lumpectomy, a double mastectomy, radiation\
      \ and a brain tumor scare. Taking charge, reflecting on her choices, maintaining\
      \ her connection to others, celebrating her expanding mindfulness and self-awareness,\
      \ Ro embodies a mindful warrior throughout her breast cancer experience, lending\
      \ strength to all those who share her journey, inspiring confidence and trust.\
      \ Through Ro\u2019s searingly honest and courageous voice this film connects\
      \ all those touched by and fearful of breast cancer, arming viewers with insights\
      \ into the experience that will dispel fears and help women face the reality\
      \ of breast cancer and its impact. Although breast cancer will be a part of\
      \ Ro for the rest of her life, she doesn't see cancer as a curse. Ro discovers\
      \ no finite answers when it comes to cancer, but Ro hopes cancerpants will generate\
      \ awareness and play a role in finding a cure."
