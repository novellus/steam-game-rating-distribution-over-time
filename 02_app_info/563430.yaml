    review: 'The exploration of the pyramid is interesting and motivating and brings
      some new approaches to old concepts. While the mechanics are not very complex,
      most attributes and every of the few items is well-thought and has its use,
      like a warp item which shortens backtracking or a radar item that allows you
      to sneak through passages which are heavily populated with enemies.

      The bizarre lore is made with passion and contributes to the unique atmosphere
      of the game.

      The only downside is  the combat system, which encourages you to go for a simplistic
      one-hit kill approach. But most combats can be avoided, even grinding is possible
      without actual fighting: One "dungeon attribute" offers a chance to win an engagement
      automatically, another one allows you too flee otherwise. This way you''ll get
      money and stats passively and without even having investested lots of attributes
      in the "combat" category.

      The single rooms are full of details and keep you motivated. At the same time
      the game does not overstay its welcome. With a playtime of ~8 hours it gives
      you all the time to dive into the gameplay and the atmosphere before it gets
      tedious or shallow.

      For free game not much you can do wrong here!'
