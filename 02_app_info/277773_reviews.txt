It's only 5 pounds for the sound pack, and includes a FAR better horn and extra cab features. Scenarios are fun with good AI but there are again only 3, which seems the very poor standard for these days. Much better after the update earlier this year too however.\n\nmodel:9/10\nsounds:5-6/10 (recycled 455)\nphysics:no idea. Judge it youself, never been on one. The power/braking is unusual being an older train but doesn't take too long to get used to.","timestamp_created":1476229958,"timestamp_updated":1605417165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jLyU5fUCf8eSYw=="}
