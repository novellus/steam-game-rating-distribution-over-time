It has some pretty cool mechanics with force grenades, suppression fire, auto fire, leadership, running/walking/standing still, etc.  So the tactical battles had a lot of potential but is let down with a very random feel.  I have no problem with random but this just feels more random than most games.  High odds are basically 50% or maybe 66% only so you will be missing a lot and so will your enemies.  With the small number of units involved, you will often feel like you win or lose more because of luck then because of good tactics unfortunately.  This really hurts the game.\n\nBeyond that, the game is extremely short with almost no story to hold it together.  Steam says I played almost 10 hours but that is incorrect as I forgot and left the launcher running a few times, 2 of those were pretty long.  So maybe 8 hours only and that is with the very long 2-3 hour tutorial (which is needed).\n\nNot much to say beyond that.  Just that there is not much variety with with only 2 enemy unit types and objectives of basically kill stuff, move to an area or carry something to an area.\n\nThe game isn't bad or anything, but I can't recommend this with the short running time and very random feeling scenarios.","timestamp_created":1604024211,"timestamp_updated":1604024211,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51754385232925415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44+LSu/UCfa38qgI="}
