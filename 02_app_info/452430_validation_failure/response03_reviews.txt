Read the forums for advice on stat and skill build for your class so you don't screw anything up and need to reroll your character.  And there are much cooler hat costumes in the game to obtain so the \"free hat\" is hardly worth that much.  Unless you're interested in investing your luck on enchant scrolls(the RNG will not be on your side) or new costumes, you don't need ingame TP.  \n\nGame is fun. Buying TP isn't.\n","timestamp_created":1462168477,"timestamp_updated":1462168477,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41IuCuNQCddHnVg=="}
