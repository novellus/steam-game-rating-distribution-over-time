Does not do BT audio well.  \n--  keeps cutting in & out so bad it's insane.\n2. lack of any skip to the 'start' of the actual tutorial/game.\n-- No one wants to wait 20-30 seconds.. while a 'cutscene' plays out in engine, just to load the play area.\n3. Slow to trigger respawn  when falling.\n\nHonestly, those 3 things genuinely make this a no buy from me.\n-- Refunded even when I got it for 70% off.\n\nI would suggest if the developers are still trying.. to stop attempting to take full control of the audio source & allow windows to mix it (as it does for any other program), so that it doesn't ruin Low latency BT connections.\nI would also suggest, not making intros manditory every time.","timestamp_created":1606522194,"timestamp_updated":1606522194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhemLhvYCe9KFtAI="}
