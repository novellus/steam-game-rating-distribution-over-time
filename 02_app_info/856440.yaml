    short_description: In front of you is a touching 2D-platformer, the central character
      of which is a simple red cube. There are many dangerous obstacles and surprises
      ahead!

    review: Level 8 is broken. You can fly by just holding space and the up arrow
      key, practically making the game a flying cube simulator rather than a platformer.
      The sandbox mode is more bland than the base 10 levels. I've played some awful
      games before. I've even recommended some awful games before. At least those
      games were working games you could beat from start to finish though. But this
      one, this ain't it chief.
