Mostly however, it plays like a somewhat generic superhero story, with the other characters being more powerful than you. There is a some amount of choice in who to possess (and how to create your character), yet these things don't  really change the plot or even your interaction with other significant characters (mostly only some small subplots change). The story is fairly concise and linear, giving a somewhat limited replay value, yet there are some different paths to explore.\n\nOn a more positive note, the individual pieces of the story are well written and quite action packed. It feels like you having experienced an action movie with a relevant amount of choice at the end of the game\n\nFor context, this is the first choice of games game I have finished, but I have played a few similar (mostly free) games. To my knowledge it seems games from choice of games have an emphasis on stats resulting in partly set paths (such as encouraging/discouraging violence depending on your initial \"build\"). ORPHEUS Ruse partly steers away from this by offering a sligthly more linear story yet retains stats as a relevant factor that limits choice in some instances. \n\nThe game took me 2 hours on my first playthrough and seems like it might offer about 2-3 interesting playthroughs with somewhat different paths\n\nAll in all I'll give the title a weak recommendation, yet I would caution anyone considering this game solely for the premise of being able to control other people (as it doesn't play a truly significant part in the story).\n7/10","timestamp_created":1593352542,"timestamp_updated":1593352542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw88rN/fICda6EkQI="}
