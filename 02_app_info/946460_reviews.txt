It took me 7 hours to finish the whole game and I wasn't bored not even once. Sure, there are some weird moments (people who played should know what I'm talking about), but overall I was really satisfied.\nRest of the game was as good as the story. \nBeautiful art, soundtrack that wasn't bad and good voice acting (which is actually a rare thing when it comes to yuri VN).\n\nApart from some grammatical errors, the whole game is pretty much flawless.","timestamp_created":1608771350,"timestamp_updated":1608771350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw39WPyfYCeoHRvAI="}
