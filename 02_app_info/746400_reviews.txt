It's fairly relaxing to sit through but also made me cry a couple of times! Some of the stories are so sad, and others are so cute! I'm having a hard time picking a favorite character, and getting the \"All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Ghost\" achievement was so hard for me because I hated upsetting the ghosts (I WANT TO HUG THEM ALL) \n\nI also liked the expansion to hell! The characters added a lot and I liked the last scenes. \n\nPROS:\n- Good storytelling\n- Relaxing\n- Original and cute art style\n- Nice music\n- Loveable characters for everyone!\n\nCONS:\n- Maybe a little bit... too simple?\n- Doesn't take long to finish (but for me that's a plus)\n\nOverall I just recommend you try it for yourself unless you don't like dating sims, but even then there's much more to it than just a dating sim! You might still enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1609991534,"timestamp_updated":1609991534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw26a+7fYCequXwQI="}
