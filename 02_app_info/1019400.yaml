    review: "Easy to get into, fun to vedge out to, it's a leisure game. Good music\
      \ great screen effects, good for entertaining friends at house parties. easy\
      \ to play, hard to master. and will work with all your own music as well as\
      \ the pre-installed tracks.  Pretty good range to play with. and not as competitive\
      \ as DDR or beat-saber. So everyone can enjoy it!  it's a perfect game to come\
      \ home from a hard day of work or school and relax to! It gets my recommendation!\
      \  \n\nCons: it did not detect my xBox1 Wolverine controller at startup no matter\
      \ what i did __Until__ i disconnected it while the game was running on the main\
      \ menu, and reconnected it while still on the menu.  I have written to the devs\
      \ about it and it will probably be fixed shortly.  That's not a big problem\
      \ though really.. Just reconnect the ctrlr while the game is running."
