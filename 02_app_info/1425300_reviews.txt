So if you want to put down 10 conveyor belts you have to click 10 times. \n\nEven with what I felt like was way too many workers, building anything takes a very long time.\n\nThere is no speed up time functionality. just pause and normal speed. \n\nOverflow is wasted instead of backlogged. This could be a misunderstanding or user error, but so far if I understand correctly, if your ratios aren't exactly perfect you will literally destroy any excess material. Not fun. (if you have 5 iron running to a machine in the time it takes the machine to use 2 iron, the extra 3 iron will be destroyed)\n\ncan't zoom in or out\n\nOverall nothing feels cohesive or fun. It feels like a struggle against a janky UI and barely functional descriptions. It took me about 15minutes with my hands in the air to figure out how to...do literally anything at all.\n\nI want to love this game, but it's just way too hard to DO anything. This game needs a massive interface overhaul with a ton of customizible options, hotkeys, zoom etc. Many features considered basic to this genre of game simply aren't present.","timestamp_created":1602341746,"timestamp_updated":1602341746,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1dbAifUCcdGEpwI="}
