    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">DESCRIPTION</h2><br>Funtime with Buffy is a
      first-person and single-player horror game inspired by the classical ones but
      aims to a unique terrifying experience. Funtime with Buffy has a cartoonish
      art syle which is also the perspective of the little girl that you play as.
      Your objective is to collect every toy you can find in the house and outside,
      avoiding to get caught by Buffy. He's challenging you by turning the lights
      off so you cannot know where it may come from. Buffy's the only one who knows
      where you are going or where you are hiding. Survive and don't get caught!<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2><br>At first it seems a regular night of a little
      girl watching cartoon on TV. Suddenly her mother asks to gather all her toys
      that are scattered around the house. She's leaving her home alone for a while.
      Since her mother left, Buffy made his appearance. He used to be abandoned in
      the basement for being a nasty plushie which it was a big mistake. Now all she
      got left is this &quot;friendly&quot; bunny. It doesn't seem very friendly at
      all... He just wanted to play, nothing else. But Buffy went upset because of
      the desertion and now he wants to take on revenge.<br>All these nights would
      feel endless when Buffy will haunt you all along... <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1470030/extras/HighresScreenshot00008.jpg?t=1607270813"

    review: "Ok, so there's only one real reason I would not recommend this game and\
      \ that is because, I think it needs a little bit of polishing up for the price\
      \ it is, it isn't much but I enjoyed the game for the most part. It just kind\
      \ of devolved into more frustration. \n\nSo to start off, the premise of the\
      \ game is simple and the design is simple too, Buffy is fantastically sinister.\
      \ I love the look of the game. I think there is a sensitivity modification missing\
      \ with the options as I had a bit of difficulty with my sensitivity of looking\
      \ around. \n\nI will also add that the sound elements of the game are pretty\
      \ great, though it can be a little jarring when some sounds loop over. The cues\
      \ to know where he is was super well done and you could easily work out the\
      \ proximity and, for the most part, could tell whether he was above or below\
      \ you. \n\nWhere I find faults with the game is the AI of Buffy, I assume after\
      \ a certain amount of time, he has to leave where you are if he can't get you\
      \ but this time seems to take a ridiculous length of time, at some points. I've\
      \ stood for minutes waiting for him to leave. When he wouldn't I had to try\
      \ and do something to push the game onward to move on leading to death, most\
      \ of the time. The high places you can get on to be safe from Buffy seem to\
      \ have issues sometimes with Buffy spawning into the master bedroom bed at times,\
      \ either getting stuck or immediately killing you. There were a few pathfinding\
      \ issues too, with the AI, from what I've noticed.\n\nFor the price, it wasn't\
      \ an awful game. But would I recommend it? No, not unless it was in early ages.\
      \ I did play this in a stream as I wanted to play a new horror game (Link is\
      \ here for anyone interested: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/842211046).\n\nI'll\
      \ look forward to seeing possible updates to improve the game!"
