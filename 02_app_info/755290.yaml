    review: "Its an expensive DvD player software when there are better free alternatives\
      \ out there like VLC. I made the mistake of buying standard expecting it to\
      \ be able to play Blu Ray Disks but was met with nagging upgrade boxes when\
      \ trying to play em. \n\nStandard only Plays DvD Disks and they are too lazy\
      \ to note that anyware in the description for the product on the steam page.\
      \ the only way to find this out is to buy it by mistake and refund or to be\
      \ funneled to their naggy site constantlly prompting buying the \"Best\" Version\
      \ of the software and giving random \"Deals\" if you idle on the site long enough.\
      \ Kind of shady if you ask me...\n\nDon't get it!"
