I understand this was made by one guy and I give props to him, he made a game that's functional. However, it's mired in some strange quirks and wonky design. \n\nSo running down the list of issues I had with this game.\n\nFirst, the camera too close in on the vehicle and the fix is an IN-GAME UPGRADE. Coupled with no map of the stage (Only a dinky Progress bar at the bottom of the screen) it can lead to you failing over and over until you learn the stage by memory and the mechanics associated with it. I'm gonna call this one a cardinal sin by racing game standards.\n\nSecond, The controls sometimes don't work and are needlessly loose. Maybe it's my controller, but I had a hell of a time playing this game on it and I play games with it fine all the time. I think it's just this title at this rate. I'll give this one a pass, but only because it might be my controller.\n\nThird, the Difficulty is another issue and only hurts this title. It starts at \"Medium\" and only goes to \"Very Hard\" with no in between. Some stages are super-easy, but it's labelled as \"Very Hard\". Other stages are labelled as \"Medium\" but will kick your teeth in for no reason. This odd curve of difficulty combined with the \"Life as Energy\" system just adds just needless frustration. \n\nFinally, The Mechanic of \"Life as Energy\". Your energy is so truncated due to equipment usage and the energy costs for them that many stages are hurdles due to it. Expend too much or run into a wall enough times and you just might as well restart the level. Most of the racer levels have energy recharge pads, but other open area zones don't and you only get the \"Mine\" option to recharge your energy meter. However, the Mine needs to kill a target to gain energy back for you, but the mine itself doesn't have a proximity detonation and you can kill yourself with it by running into it or by chunked down by the cost. The mechanic adds needless complexity and many pieces of equipment are dubious in usefulness which leads to many unneeded restarts.\n\nAll in all, I had a bad time playing \"The Next Penelope\". Some of the issues are fixed by the in-game upgrade system, but many aren't and lead to a slanted experience. However, if you can put up with the odd mechanics and strange layout, give it a shot.","timestamp_created":1609978380,"timestamp_updated":1609978380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7o+M7fYCfOKSwQI="}
