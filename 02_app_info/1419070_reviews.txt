The roster is large and diverse and you will definitely find something to love here in the wide variety of designs for the monsters. I'm going to break up this review into a few different parts.\n\nGameplay: The game is a monster taming game mixed together with roguelike elements. This has you catching monsters and adding them to your party while choosing your adventure basically by choosing between a list of generated options each path you clear. These appear to offer shops, evolution shrines, random events, and random encounters among story related events. As I said each path is generated meaning each run should theoretically be different for you. I definitely came across a variety of path choices and Mython to catch in these events so it definitely has me wanting to play more to see them all. Overall the battle system is pretty good, it's type based advantages and disadvantages with a stamina or mana meter that you have to manage throughout the run. Pretty good balance but the start of the run could be ironed out a bit more to help ease you in at least in story mode.\n\nSound: The music was pretty good overall, I really enjoyed the battle themes the most and that is a good thing as that is what you'll be hearing most of the time while in the encounters. Some themes didn't really grab me as much as others like the title theme for instance but overall the sound was very enjoyable, and as the sound relates to the battle effects and animations it all hits the mark very well.\n\nGraphics: The style is really unique, I really enjoy the high variety of color and toon like graphics. It meshes very well with the overall environments of the game and the monster designs. I'd love to be able to explore the environments and see what they have to offer personally.\n\nOverall the game gets a big recommend from me, I've only played a bit so far but I already can tell I will be coming back for more. Even in Early Access it offers a very enjoyable gameplay loop and  you will need multiple runs of the game if you want to experience everything it has to offer. The price point is very  reasonable for what is here currently, I'm excited to see what else gets added to this game over time.","timestamp_created":1609807103,"timestamp_updated":1609807103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4weD+5/YCdabHwAI="}
