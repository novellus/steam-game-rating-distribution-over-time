      \ /><br>It's WAR in TINY METAL, the revival of Japanese arcade war gaming!<br><br>The\
      \ golden age of turn-based tactics returns with a distinct Japanese flavor.\
      \ A story filled with political intrigue and personal conflict follows the assassination\
      \ of the Artemesian king. Command your infantry, roll out the tanks, and take\
      \ to the skies to exact swift retribution against your foes. Artemesia is awaiting\
      \ your orders!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/751500/extras/FocusFire.jpg?t=1578462858\"\
      \ /><br><br>Inspired by turn-based strategy games of the past, TINY METAL takes\
      \ the finely honed gameplay of classical Japanese war gaming and brings it into\
      \ the modern era with great graphics, 15 unique units, and never-before-seen\
      \ gameplay mechanics. TINY METAL is the Japanese arcade war game you wish you\
      \ had as a kid.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/751500/extras/b_story.png?t=1578462858\"\
      \ /><br><br>Play as Artemisian Lieutenant Nathan Gries as he commands his units\
      \ to victory against the villainous nation of Zipang. There will be several\
      \ friends and enemies along the way with varied factions, units, and abilities\
      \ in the 20 hours of single-player campaign gameplay. Players will have to carefully\
      \ consider varying terrain, positioning for attacks, and strategic advancements\
      \ and defenses. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/751500/extras/b_characters.png?t=1578462858\"\

      \ /><br><br><u>Nathan Gries</u><br><br>Lieutenant Nathan Gries hails from a\
      \ family of military lineage. His father died in the last war when Nathan was\
      \ still young. Col. Lindberg was a friend of Nathan's father and came to offer\
      \ guidance to Nathan. Nathan is well-regarded by his superiors and peers alike\
      \ with a promising future and noble intentions... Although Nathan is a model\
      \ officer, his lack of experience may lead to situations where he could be exploited.<br><br><u>Wolfram</u><br><br>Commander\
      \ Wolfram, a fierce, strategic, independent, business-minded soldier, and leader\
      \ of the White Fangs. She lost her brother in the previous Artemisia/Zipang\
      \ war. He fought, foolishly, for a nation that cared little for him. Which is\
      \ irrelevant. He died believing he was fighting for a greater cause. She vowed\
      \ never to make the same mistake. Wolfram will take any job that is profitable\
      \ but one never knows what she might have up her sleeve...<br><br><u>Isoroku\
      \ Tsukumo</u><br><br>Lord Isoroku Tsukumo (&quot;of 3 million stones&quot;),\
      \ the leading vassal of the Zipang shogunate. His title is a measure of his\
      \ greatness, how much he owns, and how many people he supports with his rule.\
      \ Tsukumo has an extreme obligation to duty and honor. He takes care of his\
      \ people first and foremost but is always strict and lawful, especially to himself.<br><br><img\

    reviews: "\u201CNewcomers to the turn-based strategy genre are likely to have\
      \ a blast with Tiny Metal all the way through its campaign, though the endgame\
      \ is no doubt a little restrictive. Old hands to this type of strategy game\
      \ will find a campaign that wears its influences on its sleeve, but still admirably\
      \ and respectfully fits right in with them.\u201D<br>7 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tiny-metal-review/1900-6416833/\"\

      s simplified strategy and delightful tone scratch an itch that has been festering\
      \ since Nintendo\u2019s Advance Wars series reached a ceasefire in 2008.  Battalions\
      \ of adorable tanks and warplanes engage in a series of turn-based encounters\
      \ that seem like the opening salvos of an epic tactical war.\u201D<br>7.25 \u2013\

      \ doesn\u2019t copy the Advance Wars formula \u2014 it improves it. The third\
      \ dimension brings with it a better way to do battle and tell where your enemies\
      \ are. This change allows the tactical side of combat to flourish in a new way\
      \ and one anyone who enjoys the Wars games will find it fun.\u201D<br>8 \u2013\
