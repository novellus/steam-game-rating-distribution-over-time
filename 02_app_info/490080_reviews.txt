A port of one of my favorite NDS games. But I was let down to say the least. The controls are janky, and I've discovered many bugs, some having to reset the level to fix. Thankfully i'm buying this during a sale, so 3 bucks isn't bad at all for what I got. But I don't recommend paying full price. You're better off buying the original. This has been out for a few years and nothing seems to have been fixed since release.","timestamp_created":1609842019,"timestamp_updated":1609842019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q/mD6fYCd57UwAI="}
