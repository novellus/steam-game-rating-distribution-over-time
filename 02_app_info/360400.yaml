    about_the_game: <strong>Lead survivors out of many complex mazes while quarantining
      or curing the infected. This game will test every ounce of your mental skills.</strong><br><br><u>The
      basic rules:</u><br><br>A set number of the civilians)must reach the exit zone.<br>A
      set number of zombies have to be eliminated before the time runs out.<br>...Oh
      and if a zombie reaches the blue area, you are penalised two points.<br><br><u>Plus:</u><br><br>The
      <strong>green</strong> characters (the army) act as towers, and can't move.
      But they will kill any character. Beware.<br>The <strong>white</strong> characters
      are scientists, and they can cure zombies back into civilians. <br>There are
      buttons at the top of the screen which let you end the game, or reset the current
      level. Press ESC anytime to bring up the save and load menu.<br>There are 20+
      levels.<br>The first level is a tutorial which will explain the game in more
      detail.<br><br><br><u>This game is tricky, but there are tactics which will
      help:</u><br><br>1) Units change direction when they are in the middle of certain
      paths such as the corners and the T-sections. They will also change direction
      if they run into a wall, or another unit.<br> <br>2) Scientists have a range
      of about 1 &amp; 1/2 halls. When you see a scientist move, the effected zombie
      has about 3 seconds until they are cured into a civilian unit.<br><br>3) Some
      army personnel can kill, with 1 shot. But most of the time it takes ~5 shots
      to kill.<br><br>4) Isolating individual units quickly, and reserving them for
      later can help with the pace of the game. Level 5 is a real test of this tactic.
      <br><br>5) There are wooden barricades on certain levels which only the zombies
      can attack and destroy.<br><br><br><u>Controls:</u><br><br>Click on the walls
      to create a safe or unsafe path for the characters.<br>Use the AWSD keys to
      move the camera around the level.<br>The mouse wheel to move the view up and
      down.<br>Every level has an optional camera view, and a level code.<br>Clicking
      on the change camera button will swap to an alternate camera view. Click it
      again to return to the main camera.<br><br>There may be updates for this game,
      depending on the public opinion on the current progress. Anyone to purchases
      this version will receive new versions for free.<br><br><br><u>Known glitches:</u><br><br>If
      the hall areas get filled with too many units, they may glitch and push each
      other through walls, or push each other off the main middle path. So try and
      keep them all moving, just for long enough for you to reach the requirements,
      and hit the end level button.<br><br><br>Enjoy!
