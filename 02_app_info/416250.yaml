    review: "'Tales' is reminiscent of classic 90's Point & Click Adventures.  I did\
      \ find it moderately entertaining but, this is a game that if I were rating\
      \ with stars I'd probably only give 3.  STEAM only allows me to recommend or\
      \ not and as is this game barely makes the recommended list.  However, if you\
      \ love Point & Clicks and get this on sale it's worth trying, I just don't see\
      \ too many people falling in love with it and revisiting it for subsequent playthroughs.\n\
      \nThe graphics are fine for a retro style game like this.  They are quite pixelated\
      \ and often more simplistic.  It's interesting to see some of their more simple\
      \ artwork paired with their more complex artwork.  They put like a lit of detail\
      \ into the beanstalk for example.  It doesn't look quite as good as the pictures\
      \ here look when full screen on a typical monitor setup. \n If you are a fan\
      \ of 80s-90s P&C's you'll probably find the artwork and style nostalgic.  If\
      \ you aren't into that... well, you probably won't enjoy it as much.  I will\
      \ say that the animations are well done for example when Alfred climbs up from\
      \ something it's surprisingly detailed for an animation.  The walk paths are\
      \ pretty good too.\n\nThe story is ... okay.  The premise of traveling through\
      \ stories (Tales) is actually something I find interesting but, the story here\
      \ is perhaps a little too juvenile and underdeveloped.  The writing is off in\
      \ my opinion.  You're traveling through stories like Gilgamesh or Ancient Greek\
      \ myths and the characters call you dude and say things like \"hey, man\". \
      \ The vernacular is just really out of place and out of character for many of\
      \ the characters portrayed.  The stories aren't woven together or anything so\
      \ they just tell a tiny portion of the original stories.  You go into a story\
      \ to get one or two things by completing some small part of the story then pop\
      \ back out to go to another story.  The overall arc of saving human knowledge\
      \ and stories from Oblivion is the only thing tying them together and the connection\
      \ feels a little weak.\n\nThe background music for the game is pretty decent.\
      \  I wouldn't be looking to play the soundtrack separately but, it matches most\
      \ of the game well.  The voices were well recorded for the most part and are\
      \ consistent in sound quality but the voice acting... well, it leaves something\
      \ to be desired.  Though there's characters from the Middle East, Europe, Mayan\
      \ South America, etc... most of the characters re voiced with very white American\
      \ accents which doesn't lend to the feeling of being transported to the lands\
      \ of these tales.  One odd example is the Mayan woman who sounds Irish.  The\
      \ voices in that sense are just not right for most of the characters in my opinion.\n\
      \nThe interface for the game is actually pretty simple.  You can right click\
      \ to look at something and left click to interact with it.  The inventory is\
      \ accessed by mousing over top of the screen.  My biggest pet peeve is the inventory\
      \ though.  In the game you travel into and out of several stories but you can\
      \ only take one item out of the story at a time using a magic bag you get shortly\
      \ you begin playing.  I hated having to remember where dozens of items were\
      \ and going back and grabbing one item and transporting it into a new are. \
      \ Why couldn't you just have your inventory be a magical bag and let it hold\
      \ everything you want to collect?  Other than that the system seemed to work\
      \ fine.\n\nThe puzzles in this game were actually a little challenging... well\
      \ most of them.  Not just the puzzle, puzzles but, the using inventory items\
      \ to complete story progression type puzzles too.  The advice given is often\
      \ too vague and some solutions are not very logical to me as to how you would\
      \ arrive at that conclusion.  This was actually a little more challenging than\
      \ I find most P&C games to be.  I don't know if I'd call any of them \"moon\
      \ logic\" but with little direction on what needs to happen you often spend\
      \ a lot of wasted time just trying random items.  Sometimes the action/discussion\
      \ needs to be repeated in order to move forward but, it doesn't make it obvious\
      \ that that is what is required.  I did have to use more hints on this game\
      \ than I usually do.  The puzzle, puzzles are a little difficult to figure out\
      \ on first try (if your going for the related achievement be sure to save before\
      \ the puzzle then fiddle around with it and reload your game to use your solution\
      \ and get credit towards the achievement).  They often require some effort to\
      \ figure out.\n\nThe game does have a fair amount of achievements.  Many are\
      \ story unlocked, several require solving puzzles on the first try, and a few\
      \ are for extra things such as exhausting all chat dialogues, looking at everything,\
      \ not asking Merlin for extra advice, etc...  I got all but four on my first\
      \ playthrough.  I think it might be near impossible to get them all in one playthrough\
      \ but you should be able to do it in 2.  There is one for completing the game\
      \ without autosave or save games.  This would be extremely difficult on a first\
      \ play.  Apparently a second run through theoretically takes around 45 minutes(I've\
      \ not yet tested that) which wouldn't be too bad.  However, that's if you speed\
      \ through dialogue and cutscenes.  If you missed the chatty achievement (don't\
      \ know how since I thought I talked to everyone a lot exhausting all options)\
      \ then you'll probably have to take longer.\n\nI played through in about 11\
      \ hours though I'm not sure that's accurate as I had some performance issues\
      \ with the game freezing and crashing.  It happened quite frequently actually\
      \ which is one of the reasons I rate this game a little lower.  I believe that\
      \ 10-12 hours is probably pretty accurate. That makes it about $0.67-$0.79/hr\
      \ of gameplay.  I don't think it has much replay ability but, that's a pretty\
      \ decent price point even at full price.  I do however recommend waiting for\
      \ a sale."
