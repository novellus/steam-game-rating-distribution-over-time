Don't waste your money. There is no other way to put it. I was one of the play-testers for this game while it was still in development. Even then, there were plenty of issues with this game. Feedback was given, and I hoped the game would be improved upon. My morbid curiosity got the best of me, and I purchased this game to see what it had improved upon.\n\nIt hasn't improved at all. In fact, it seems to be in a worse state then before. I'll go through some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- The skill tree is probably the only good thing about this game. It appears cool. But I can't bring the patience to continue playing this game to see all the skills.\n\nCons:\n- The map is a series of boring, repeating textures that provide nothing unique or interesting. The mini-map is just a gray rectangle with no features on it. You can't even put waypoints on it. The markers for the \"quests\" do not show what quest they are for, making walking around mindless and confusing.\n- Combat is dull and redundant. Just cast spells or swing at enemies until they die. They do the same to you. Some spells are kind of neat, like the stone entrapment spell some enemies cast. Nothing awesome though. Also, there is no audio for the combat. Yeah . . .\n- Quests are not \"interesting\" or \"meaningful\" like the game suggests. They provide nothing to the 'story.' One just has a tree burn down, and that's it. One is to retrieve an item, where the 'choice' is to keep it or give it to the quest-giver. The other quests just seem to be kill some bosses.\n- There is no story. The game itself is just a mindless, empty zone with boring enemies.\n- The graphics aren't good. Now, this doesn't automatically mean the game is bad. I love plenty of games where the graphics are not great (Neverwinter Nights, Fallout, Oblivion). But everything in this game just looks like blobs.\n- No keybinding options, which sucks because the controls in this game are awkward.\n- Many bugs and crashes. It crashed on me twice. It wouldn't let me walk occasionally, causing me to have to reload the game. Also had the game-breaking bug where all the bosses and quest locations would spawn at the hub, making the game unplayable. Even after this happened, if I tried to create a new character and then the game would spawn me dead without respawning, rendering it unplayable. I had to reinstall the game to fix this issue.\n- The game is too expensive. Originally, it was $9.99, which is an egregious price for this game. Even at $3.99, it is far too expensive. The game is maybe worth $0.99, but I have played free flash games more enjoyable than this.\n\nSave your money. Spend it on something else much better. I will be refunding this product.","timestamp_created":1593465691,"timestamp_updated":1593465691,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.651206731796264648","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t5v9gPMCcO25kQI="}
