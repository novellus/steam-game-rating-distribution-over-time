Yes, the graphics looked like crap and the game boring due to the trailer on the page. Thankfully, this first person reimagining of Bomberman from indie dev WTFOMGames is honestly not that bad a title. This isn't to say it isn't without faults.\n\nEvery stage you feel like you're walking on ice, making it very troublesome to navigate. On top of that, the mouse sensitivity is incredibly high to the point that you wind up doing a 360 degree turn with a meer twitch of the wrist if that. But once you get the hang of the controls and movement of the enemies, which all move along a pre-determined path (or so it seems) unless you're right up next to them.\n\nAs it stands, Sapper's Bad Dream isn't as bad as the trailer makes it out to be. Yes, visually it could do with a lot more work, but overall being cast into a labyrinth with ghosts of past bombermen (or so I assume they are) is a nice, lamenting touch. The game has its issues, not to mention some really out of place enemies, but even with those it still stand a surprisingly fun, even tense little offering.","timestamp_created":1468137334,"timestamp_updated":1468138492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.34684455394744873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhvL36dUCdoW1XA=="}
