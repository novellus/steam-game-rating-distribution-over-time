    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Introduction</h2>Invasion Machine is a blend\
      \ of a<strong> <u>sandbox manager</u></strong> and <strong><u>RTS</u></strong>.\
      \ Your goal is to command troops in an occupied province, in an effort of bringing\
      \ back peace and order. Kill your enemies, help the civilian population, preserve\
      \ the resources and the lives of your own soldiers.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/964650/extras/convoy-boom-616x220.gif?t=1583336875\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Setting</h2>What led to our recent occupation of\
      \ this land is still at the center of a heated political debate.<br>What followed\
      \ the invasion, was the worst scenario we may ever have imagined - we hoped\
      \ we\u2019d be able to instill better leadership and let this country rebuild\
      \ itself. But that\u2019s not what happened, though. Our toppling of the local\
      \ government created a power vacuum in the area - which is now quickly leading\
      \ to an unprecedented rise of new powers - the druglords, locally known as Guerrillas.\
      \ If we don\u2019t stop this transformation, this entire country is gonna explode.\
      \ We were not preparing for this kind of wae, and it seems it\u2019s the last\
      \ moment when we can still turn things around.<br><br>You, as the Commander\
      \ of this Peace Force are tasked with restoring order and preparing ground for\
      \ a new, legitimate government.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Mission</h2>If we\u2019\
      re to ever leave this land, we must first win over the <strong>hearts and minds</strong>\
      \ of the local population. The locals think we\u2019ve ruined their lives and\
      \ quite frankly - most of them hates us. In order to win their trust - we must\
      \ do our best to <strong>push out the criminal element</strong>, neutralize\
      \ the remaining opposition and offer humanitarian help to them.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">The Real Mission</h2>Politicians run wars, and politicians only care\
      \ about one thing - getting re-elected. In other words - <strong>your real job\
      \ as the Commander</strong> is to make this war <strong>look good to the folks\
      \ back home</strong>. Don\u2019t get your soldiers killed, don\u2019t lose too\
      \ much equipment, and most importantly - don\u2019t let the press see anything\
      \ that would contradict the official story. And the official story? It\u2019\
      s obviously that we\u2019re winning.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Campaign</h2>Divided\
      \ into 8 chapters. The game takes you through the entire story of the invasion,\
      \ starting <strong>right after the main battle of the war ends</strong>. At\
      \ the beginning you are given just a handful of troops and old, derelict equipment.\
      \ Unarmored, soft-shell transporters on the frontline? <strong>Check</strong>.\
      \ Woodland camo in a desert country? <strong>Check</strong>. The army wasn\u2019\
      t really prepared for a long invasion, and yours is just one of many missions\
      \ in this conflict. So if you want better resources - you\u2019re gonna have\
      \ to prove to your superiors that you\u2019re worth them. The campaign ends\
      \ once you manage to secure your province and hold elections. When a new government\
      \ can be trusted with taking the country over, we finally get to go home.<br><br><img\

      notes: This game is serious in tone, and attempts to depict the despair of a
        modern armed conflict. You can expect to see gory violence, death, drug trade
        and mistreatment of non-combatant civilian population. When shot, your wounded
        units bleed out and there's sometimes nothing you can do about it.
