For a 2018 game the graphics are pretty OK, I can notice a glimpse of a very peculiar art style, given a caricaturistic look to the characters and highlighting a lot of facial traces and details. In regard to the soundtrack, it is quite immersive and it fits like a glove in the game and contributes to this atmosphere of mystery, suspense and occultism.\n[list][/list] But let's get back to the episode! Since from here forward everything has changed. We are embracing a story that I did not expect, yes I had some clues that this could be the way to go, but I was not expecting all the details of it...\n[list][/list] This episode was incredibly fast, don’t know if it was because it is really short or if it is only because with so many things happening it passed really fast. \nThe puzzles available were fun and very challenging, and that has been the most cohesive aspect throughout the game. \n[list][/list] Please don’t get me wrong, the story has been great, but is not very cohesive, sometimes it takes a long time to get anywhere, so other times you get there faster than you expect, and when you are processing one outcome, bang you are hit by another major event. \n[list][/list] But I don’t want to get into details, the game is history driven so any detail could be a spoiler to someone. So far I really enjoyed it! Fully recommend this game! \n[list][/list](Don't forget to check my review of the other episodes on the Steam page of each one of them).","timestamp_created":1600603246,"timestamp_updated":1600603267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+/PY1fQCc4n8ogI="}
