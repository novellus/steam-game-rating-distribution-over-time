It's is one of those 'Where the f**k do I go?' type of games, where you easily get lost and quickly lose interest like I had. I know I'm being too harsh on this small indie game, but what makes a horror/exploration game engaging is to have more stuff happening, in a slightly more linear, slightly branched-out level design. I'm no game designer or someone who's patient, but at least give the player some direction and a reason to keep going on, because I like to see more of this game's '1950's Manhattan experiment site' type of setting, idk.","timestamp_created":1602038673,"timestamp_updated":1607131056,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+LiemPYCdaiqpgI="}
