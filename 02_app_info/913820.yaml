    review: "This game has a cool concept similar to WMMA, with the interesting thing\
      \ being that you're supposed to be running your own gym. However, the game falls\
      \ flat due to this game being released about 2-3 years before it was ready.\
      \ \n\n- There are bugs all over the place and the game crashes repeatedly.\n\
      - There isn't much to do. There aren't enough organizations or teams. This game\
      \ really should have been a free beta where he asked people what he could improve\
      \ upon in the game.\n- The game is not in-depth enough. It needs more story\
      \ lines. It just needs more, honestly.\nThe developer has pretty much given\
      \ up on it and so nothing is going to change. Don't buy it and let someone else\
      \ make their own game or try WMMA."
