    about_the_game: <strong>Story</strong><br><br>Willard Rouse is an ordinary 17-year
      high school student who is often by himself. By accident, he discovered that
      he is a spirit bearer, one who could summon and use the power of spirits. After
      getting kicked out of Rainvalley Academy, he transferred to Ficaso Academy.

      to be. Willard started to have suspicions when he learned that the school prohibits
      students to make contact with the outside world until they graduate. Eventually,
      Willard realized that all the students in Ficaso are spirit bearers but they
      are unable to summon their spirits due to spirit jammers strategically placed
      around the academy. What secrets lie beneath the walls of Ficaso Academy? What
      challenges await Willard and his friends in their quest to escape? <br><br>Discover
      the secrets of Ficaso Academy; learn more about Shades, creatures who devour
      the souls of spirit bearers, and meet the powerful Spirits that could be summoned
      by Willard and his friends. Watch Willard hone his spirit powers and develop
      his relationships with the people around him!

    review: Amazing art and fast-paced. If you like short VNs with nice art and likeable
      characters, this VN is for you. There are caption typos but the strength of
      this VN is truly in the artwork. Dialogues can be improved but that should be
      an easy fix. I would suggest creating other VNs for the other characters apart
      from MC. For instance, Clustre, Atalica, and the Guchi girl all look like they
      could have their own VNs centered around them. The story in the 'other world'
      where MC was transported was quite short but I thought that was okay because
      it's not a multi-season anime like Fairy Tail.
