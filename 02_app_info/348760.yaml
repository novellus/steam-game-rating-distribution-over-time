    review: "This DLC gives you 5 Scenarios all for FREE, there is no reason not to\
      \ get it.\n\nThe missions are quite hard but you get to fight huge battles and\
      \ some of them as the Orks ofc!\nWho doesnt want to kill Yarrik,Dante and Van\
      \ Strab as Warboss Thraka!? overrunn them with Gargants or hordes of Megaarmoured\
      \ nobs. \n\nSo far I have played them all but only beaten 1, I will do them\
      \ all eventually."
