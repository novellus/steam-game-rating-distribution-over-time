    short_description: Remind yourself maintains a characteristic of suspence and
      horror where the story has a fundamental role and you must guess because it
      has multiple endings. It will prove your mind. It is needed that a player be
      quiet in extremes moments to maintain himself alive. Each step will be an experience
      to have into account.
