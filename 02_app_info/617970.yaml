    review: "Hello Steam user who is wondering if this little visual novel is worth\
      \ their time. I'm going to tell you right now that the answer is a sad no which\
      \ is actually quite frustrating because I really wanted to like this game. It\
      \ has everything I like in stories like this. It has mystery and intrigue and\
      \ romance and supernatural elements to enrich the world and yet how it's executed\
      \ is like something cobbled together like a blind drunk monkey on a typewriter.\
      \ Seriously, the mechanics in this game are not great. We're not talking 1931\
      \ Scheherazade bad but they are not good and they really bogged down what could've\
      \ been a great cheesy Halloween visual novel.\n\nPros\n\u2013 Art. This is a\
      \ Winter Wolves game so the one thing that they've managed to be consistent\
      \ in is in good art direction and for this project they really nailed it with\
      \ the unique character designs as well is the art style being a little bit more\
      \ cartoony for that Halloween charm as well as the nice autumn colors. No complaints\
      \ on this front.\n\u2013 The concept. I like the idea of the main character\
      \ slowly succumbing to a curse isn't original all but that was probably the\
      \ best thing about this game. The dream sequences in particular were especially\
      \ great in really adding to the suspense and the slow psychological horror of\
      \ realizing something is wrong but not being able to do a damn thing about it.\
      \ If there were more of them in this game then this would not be a negative\
      \ review.\n\u2013 The characters. Despite how frustrated I am with this game\
      \ I'm only really frustrated because of how I enjoyed the characters. Each one\
      \ of the love interest had a specific goal in mind other than romance and each\
      \ felt like an individual instead of just a cookie-cutter generic supernatural\
      \ love interest to romance.\n\u2013 The music. Nails the tone, especially during\
      \ the dream sequences.\n\nCons\n\u2013 the job week mechanics. Honestly this\
      \ was just a terrible idea. For each one of the love interest you work one day\
      \ a week at their job idea which I guess would be fine if the game didn't force\
      \ you to have to work all of those jobs at the same time which means you're\
      \ working on every romance path until the game forces you to pick one over halfway\
      \ through which just kills any real inclination to do any replaying since you\
      \ basically have already seen most of the scenarios except for the last couple.\
      \ Also the money mechanic and presents was pointless unless you're aiming for\
      \ a steam achievement. The two different endings for whatever stat you were\
      \ building up don't have enough variation to bother reading through... If this\
      \ was implemented differently or if you could just pick one romance interest\
      \ to be on right off the bat then this wouldn't have been so bad but the fact\
      \ that you're forced to do all the romance paths until near the end is just\
      \ ludicrous.\n\u2013 Continuity. Yet another problem that's introduced because\
      \ you're playing every romance path at the same time. The scenes themselves\
      \ are written pretty damn well most of the time but they often contradict each\
      \ other because whoever was writing them didn't seem to be realizing that they\
      \ were to be all played it once so sometimes they reference events that never\
      \ actually happened or characters you know are suddenly treated as strangers\
      \ because you're not actively romancing them. As a writer this thoroughly irritates\
      \ me. This is especially prevalent with the character of Ashley but I feel like\
      \ that's mostly because she was a later addition but still it's really noticeable\
      \ and ruins my suspension of disbelief which you never want to when you're doing\
      \ fiction.\n\u2013 The second person narration. Okay this actually doesn't bother\
      \ me as much as it has other reviewers because I thought the second person really\
      \ worked during the dream sequences because it added to the suspense and horror\
      \ but for the regular portions of the game it's just kind of jarring and there\
      \ is a reason why second person narration is not common and it's mostly because\
      \ it's just awkward to read. It almost feels surreal in a lot of ways which\
      \ again why I think it works well for the dream sequences but not so much for\
      \ the regular portions.\n\u2013 The mystery is never solved. I would blank this\
      \ out as a spoiler but I feel like this is a spoiler people should actually\
      \ see before they buy. Like it's never really explained why you're cursed, at\
      \ least on in any of the routes I've done and the more routes you do I feel\
      \ like the less you learn which is not how it's supposed to go. Honestly it's\
      \ really feels like the dick who cursed you just did it because they are a priggish\
      \ dick and that's not really the answer was looking for in a game that was hinting\

      \ doesn't bother me but then again I'm used to anime that has ACTUAL vomit inducing\
      \ incest so the fact that they're just stepsiblings with no blood shared makes\
      \ me feel better already. I can see where this would be a major turnoff for\
      \ other people and kind of wish that they had a friendship option with her instead\
      \ of full-blown romance.\n\n Honestly this thing feels like a wasted opportunity\
      \ or missed potential due to bad mechanics and the fact that not only is the\
      \ story cobbled together poorly but does not actually like answering questions.\
      \ The fact that he even played it more than once is attributed to my like of\
      \ the characters who really deserved a better put together game that actually\
      \ answers the questions it poses as well is capitalizing more on the Halloween\
      \ spirit which it tries to emulate.\n\nIf you do really want to try out this\
      \ game I suggest a sale because twenty dollars is definitely too steep for such\
      \ a frustrating product"
