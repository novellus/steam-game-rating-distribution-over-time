    about_the_game: "Don\u2019t Shoot Rabbit is a mini game, as my first completed\
      \ game product. Though I didn\u2019t provide English UI support, it is just\
      \ simple enough to understand how to play it. Tutorials and button pictures\
      \ will guide you. The purpose of this game is mini, too. Try to compete with\
      \ your friends, win a high score, and play fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomething\
      \ worth Noting:<br />\r\n1. Please play this game under window mode. Only 16:9\
      \ screens will get a perfect fit.<br />\r\n2. If you can\u2019t run this game\
      \ at 60fps, please check software like dynamic screensaver, and turn it off.<br\
      \ />\r\n3. This game can be played with keyboard and mouse. If you want to restart\
      \ one round quickly, press Enter(v1.2.1 changed).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(If you\
      \ have any idea of this game, please feel free to comment)"
