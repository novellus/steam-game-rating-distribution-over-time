    reviews: "\u201CFrom start to finish, this is a dandy of a game. Lovers of adventure\
      \ games who\u2019ve maybe stayed away from this series because they think these\
      \ games are \u201Cfor kids\u201D might want to take this opportunity to check\
      \ out what HerInteractive is doing. This isn\u2019t just an excellent Nancy\
      \ Drew game, it\u2019s an excellent adventure game, period.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      \ to Emily that she enjoyed this game as much as the others, although in a slightly\
      \ different way\u2026 As she indicated above, its differences were such that\
      \ she wasn\u2019t able to compare it to the others in terms of how much she\
      \ liked it \u2013 when I asked that question she responded \u201Cit wasn\u2019\
      t better or worse, it was different\u201D. She is already looking forward to\

    review: I wish I could give this a wavering thumb, instead of just an up or down.
      It has fun puzzles, stories, and characters, but I felt like a large part of
      the game was playing secretary. And that ending... was everyone just standing
      outside rehearsing their bit while you were DYING????? Dear goodness, was that
      awkward! Anyways, I'd say the game was a 6-7/10; not fantastic, but not something
      I'd be bored playing again.
