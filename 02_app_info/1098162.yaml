    about_the_game: "The 4,000-horsepower SD70, the final locomotive to utilize Electro-Motive\u2019\
      s long-standard \u201CSpartan Cab\u201D design, is ready for Train Simulator\
      \ service dressed in Canadian National\u2019s flashy black, red, and white livery.<br><br>The\
      \ EMD SD70 family of locomotives was introduced in 1992. Along with its hefty\
      \ 4,000 horses derived from Electro-Motive\u2019s 16-cylinder 710G3B power plant,\
      \ the SD70 was notable for its use of EMD\u2019s HTCR radial truck. By the time\
      \ the SD70 series of locomotives was introduced, the \u201CNorth American\u201D\
      \ cab design had become the standard for new locomotives (making the SD70M,\
      \ in effect, the \u201Cstandard\u201D model). Seemingly, EMD\u2019s angular\
      \ Spartan Cab design, which dated back to the GP35 of 1963, had reached the\
      \ end of the line. But such was not the case, as four railroads ordering the\
      \ SD70 type choose to specify the Spartan Cab design and these units would thus\
      \ carry the straight \u201CSD70\u201D designation. At final count, 122 Spartan\
      \ Cab-equipped SD70s were constructed between 1993 and 1999.<br><br>Among the\
      \ railroads buying the SD70 was the famed U. S. railroad Illinois Central, which\
      \ purchased 40 units (IC road numbers 1000-1039) during the period 1995-1999.\
      \ Originally dressed in IC\u2019s black and white livery, the SD70s became mainstays\
      \ on the IC\u2019s Chicago-New Orleans main line.<br><br>The year 1999 also\
      \ marked Illinois Central\u2019s integration into North American giant Canadian\
      \ National, and soon the IC SD70s began appearing in CN\u2019s flashy livery\
      \ with IC sub-lettering. Today, the majority of the SD70s purchased by Illinois\
      \ Central continue to serve the CN and can be found operating throughout both\
      \ the United States and Canada.<br><br>The Canadian National SD70, created by\
      \ Dovetail Games third-party programme partner Travel by Train, is outfitted\
      \ in CN\u2019s black, red, and white livery and is provided in standard and\
      \ winter textures. The SD70 is an ideal addition to the Train Simulator stable\
      \ and is appropriate for use on a number of North American Train simulator routes\
      \ given that CN locomotives often serve in run-through service on other railroads.\
