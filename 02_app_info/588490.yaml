    review: Yes, TrickStyle will deliver those nostalgic vibes, and I am grateful
      to have experienced this classic now because I never owned it on Dreamcast.
      But this game will test your patience. The slippery controls will undoubtedly
      give you the authentic feeling of riding a Back-to-the-Future-style hoverboard
      with no contact to the ground, which is, however, exactly what I found so frustrating.
      Buy TrickStyle if you like this kind of challenge and are a glutton for punishment
      like me.
