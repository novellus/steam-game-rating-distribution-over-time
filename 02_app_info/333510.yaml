    review: "Listen to me. Stop it. Shut up. Listen.\n\nThis is far from my favourite\
      \ game on Steam. It's far from my most played game on Steam. I will say this\
      \ instead. This is my most admired game on Steam. Currently I own 781 games.\
      \ I'm not often in the mood to play it, now that I've finished it on hard. However,\
      \ I keep it installed on every machine I have Steam on.\n\n\"But you've played\
      \ a paltry 20 hours only!\" - That's mostly true. I think I played maybe 5-6\
      \ more hours that weren't logged one time. That's not the point though. This\
      \ game doesn't need \"progression\" systems, with artificially tacked on hooks\
      \ to trick you into playing indefinitely. You have everything you need to play\
      \ at the absolute highest level from the beginning. I don't need to drop 80\
      \ hours to treasure this... and I find myself returning to it for an hour or\
      \ so every few months.\n\nI know that this is a weird choice. It's idiosyncratic.\
      \ If you would like, though, let's try to explore what makes Isbarah so special.\
      \ \n\n- Bullet Hell Bliss. Dodging is sexy. Dodging in slow motion is double\
      \ sexy. Double dash dodging in slow motion is... I dunno, I'm not a mathematician.\
      \ The game is not about you doing combos and attacks of your own. It's about\
      \ you frantically weaving through impossible curtains of bullets and although\
      \ you are in a state of absolute panic somehow doing it with grace and beauty.\
      \ I know that this subgenre is intimidating to people, but strangely Isbarah\
      \ makes even advanced scoring concepts such as \"grazing\" incredibly readable\
      \ and clear. This game will trick you into appearing superhuman.\n\n- Memorisation\
      \ is for chumps. This game isn't about \"learning patterns\" and trial and error\
      \ in the traditional sense. I'm sure that those skills help. However, the game\
      \ gives you enough tools to dodge, slow-mo, and wall your way through every\
      \ challenge in a variety of ways that the idea of \"solving\" a particular pattern,\
      \ or there being only one way out of a certain boss phase, is laughable. Some\
      \ of the added challenges you can enable, such as the ghost bullet, really highlight\
      \ how this isn't a game about min-maxing and optimizing your way to victory.\
      \ \n\n- Difficulty. Obviously this is a divisive concept in games these days.\
      \ For most games, I usually start on normal or hard (depending on the game and\
      \ number of choices) and then find little need to go back and play through again\
      \ at a higher difficulty. For whatever reason... the itch is here for this one.\
      \ It's not to scratch off steam achievements or tell my friends how great I\
      \ am at this somewhat obscure indie game. I feel the drive to get further in\
      \ Isbarah because I purely enjoy getting further in Isbarah. Currently chipping\
      \ away at some of the bosses on \"7th hell\" level difficulty. The game is a\
      \ thing of beauty at all levels. \n\nTo the extent that this game is a new genre\
      \ (and it sort of is), I am absolutely begging for more in this genre. I cannot\
      \ wait to see what this developer does next."
