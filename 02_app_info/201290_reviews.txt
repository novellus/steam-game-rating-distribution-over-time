It's good RTS fun for those who like to build and win slowly. The boring man's RPG you might say. And I'm as boring as they get. You get to really build your empire and feel like you're winning, rather than C&C where you just keep spamming units at the enemy until they get destroyed.\n\nIt's varied enough that I went through almost all the \"small\" map scenarios one after the other without wanting to play a different game. Wow, I AM boring.","timestamp_created":1609337437,"timestamp_updated":1609337437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475113123655319214","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tI//2fYCdMLkvgI="}
