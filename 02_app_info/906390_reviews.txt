The overall atmosphere was sort of surreal, had a VHS feel to it, but was very slow (in a good way). A main mechanic in the game is waiting, which is a pain for an impatient person like me, but I still enjoyed all of it--yes even the numerous deaths. Luckily there are check points, so if you're bad at platforming games like me, you'll still be able to beat the game. Overall just a lovely little experience I was glad to be a part of. :)","timestamp_created":1609780271,"timestamp_updated":1609780271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546827793121337891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+bKY5/YCfqG5wAI="}
