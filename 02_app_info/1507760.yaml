      \ yourself what it feels like to be homeless. You will be exploring a large\
      \ winter city looking for food, saving yourself from cold and wind at a fire,\
      \ and searching for safe shelters at night so that you may survive as long as\
      \ you can. You have to constantly monitor your body temperature so that you\
      \ don\u2019t die because of the cold. To keep it high enough, you can find a\
      \ warm shelter or make a fire. You can also cook yourself some food on a fire.\
      \ You can find food somewhere too, but make sure you don\u2019t get a poisoning.\
      \ To recover your energy, you need to sleep. But it\u2019s even colder at night,\
      \ so you will have to find a warm shelter with no wind getting inside."
