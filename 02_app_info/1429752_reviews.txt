I think it's my favourite modern day british route. I usually prefer stuff set in BR times.\nVery glad to see it back, I was really sad to think that people would be missing out on this one. The only thing that disappointed me about this route is the variety of quickdrive consists: it's slightly lower than the route's predecessor, the Bristol-Cardiff route. I had to create some new preloads to make Pacers, Sprinters and that other small DMU from Armstrong Powerhouse appear as AI.\nI still  highly recommend this route, it's very fun, long, fairly fast and has a large variety of QD traffic. A lot of trains from other packs and routes is programmed to appear in QD.","timestamp_created":1606847842,"timestamp_updated":1606847842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Yjmj/YCeJHItgI="}
