      \ /><br>The city surrounding the school of St. Clementine is infamous for its\
      \ trove of ghost stories and folklore - so much so that's it's crept onto the\
      \ aging campus of the school itself. Following his dream of pursuing a cause\
      \ dear to him, Mizukami Sei heads to his new place of enrollment; but from the\
      \ beginning, everything seems off to him.  His curiosity getting the best of\
      \ him, he continues to explore the school, but brushes off the rumors and stories\
      \ of &quot;mysterious&quot; happenings as mere hearsay. Gathering an unlikely\
      \ group of friends and slowly exploring and learning more about the school and\
      \ its history, the legends surrounding the school begin to seem increasingly\
      \ suspicious.  Accompanied by the stern student council vice president and sweet\
      \ librarian of the school, Sei, emboldened by his personal pursuits, and his\
      \ roommate Yuuto together delve deeper into the dark mysteries of the St Clementine\
      \ - even if consequences may lay ahead.<br><br>Will they be able to solve the\
      \ mysteries of St Clementine, and more importantly, will they survive? Can they\
      \ trust each other? And what exactly are the dark secrets this school hides?<br><br><img\

    short_description: In pursuit of a cause dear to him, Mizukami Sei heads to a
      new school; but from the beginning, everything seems off, and the intense folklore
      pervading the surrounding hasn't helped. What dark secrets lurk in St. Clementine's
      shadows?

    review: 'The quick time events are honestly terrible, unlike VN''s such as The
      Letter where the QTE''s are simple tasks while a scene unfolds. This is just
      button mashing half the time to a static image, and other half the time they
      are puzzles which you''d think would be enjoyable. Except they are just memory
      tests, nothing interesting.


      Then there are the list of typo''s and errors.

      Heck i''d fix it for them they are so obvious.'
