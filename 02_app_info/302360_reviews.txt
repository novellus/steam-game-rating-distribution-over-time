This time i got the good finale!","timestamp_created":1609714669,"timestamp_updated":1609714669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43JKe5fYCd8qcwAI="}
