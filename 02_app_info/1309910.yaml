    review: "You get exactly what you are looking for, a hidden object game. No \"\
      search for obscure item in screen A, have in your action bar, you will need\
      \ it in a weird puzzle five screens later\". Some minigames inbetween that are\
      \ actual jigsaw puzzles. Chill game, no attempt at pushing a completely idiotic\
      \ story on you. There is a surrounding story of course, but it's the bare minimum\
      \ to tie the various search screens together. The game even has some fitting\
      \ and somewhat cute animation, like a lizard walking through a desert scene\
      \ or a plane flying through the air. \n\nIf what you are looking for is a chill,\
      \ no useless fluff decently looking modern version of Where is Waldo, pick this\
      \ title."
