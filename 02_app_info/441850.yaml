    review: 'You get about 3 voices with the package, after importing the only 3 or
      4 extra free ones available, the program crashed when you try and play them.


      When looking at the other voices "compatible" with the software, they range
      from $10 - $100 a voice!


      An absolute rip off - steer clear.'
