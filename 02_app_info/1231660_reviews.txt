Wandering Dr. Faust's Forest[/b]\n[i]A new dungeon area is added with this DLC.[/i] You gain access to this upon clearing a level in the Misty Forest after starting a new game (both brand new or NG+). It's a small-sized map that you can comfortably explore bringing nothing but few pieces of rotten food. The rest of your inventory can be reserved for loot drops.\n\n[b]Dungeon Features[/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]BOSS — Faust:[/b] A fun encounter that creates the exit portal once defeated. Unlike other bosses, Faust can be farmed as he will respawn on your next entry.\n[*][b]New Enemies:[/b] Post-Op variants of the Followers from the Misty Forest. Same skills though.\n[*][b]Guest Enemies:[/b] Enemies from the Cathedral and Cursed Town also appear.\n[*][b]New Traps:[/b] Golden Mimics and Light Flower Traps. They're everywhere.\n[*][b]New Combat Consumables:[/b] These items are immune to the Mist's contamination mechanic.\n[*]—[i]Chocolate: Clears status and mesmerize ailments[/i]\n[*]—[i]Donuts: Regenerate life every turn for 6 turns (comes in S/M/L sizes)[/i]\n[*][b]Dungeon Scaling:[/b] All loot and enemies found in the dungeon scale to your crew's average level. You can easily acquire level-appropriate gear without much risk.\n[*][b]Ignores Doomsday Clock:[/b] The clock will not move while exploring this dungeon. You can come and go as often as you like. However, running away still incurs the usual loot, experience, and gold penalties.\n[/list]\n\n[b]2. Achievements[/b]\n[i]There are 13 achievements associated with this DLC.[/i] If you are aiming to platinum [i]Mistover[/i], this will be required. Nearly all of them are tied to the Faust boss encounter.\n\n[h1]Impact on Gameplay[/h1]\nWhile offering a nice change of pace from time to time, [i]Dr. Faust's Otherworldly Adventure[/i] lowers the difficulty of the game as it provides a (mostly) safe environment to farm for level-appropriate gear and gold. This is especially true for players that choose to play with the Doomsday Clock enabled on Hard mode, since you always have the option to run this instead of an area that may be challenging or too low for your crew to run without having the clock tick forward.\n\nClearing the dungeon is relatively easy compared to most areas in the game, as the only things you need to watch out for are branding (focus fire) from Executioner Shotels and Bows, and stuns from Collectors and Wraiths. Enemies are often lined up for column-based skills or a juicy Chaos★Blast from your Witch, so have fun with the AoEs. However, the Faust encounter can prove to be quite challenging if you tackle his dungeon early on without any sort of equipment, since he can overwhelm you with fodder and heal himself every now and then. In the case of which this happens and you realize he's going to show you the way out, there's no shame in running away because you still make out with half of your acquired loot.\n\nYeah, this means you can go raid the forest for loot (preferably with a Shadow Blade for invisibility), avoid all the monster encounters, and run away so you keep a good chunk of the spoils and not level up in the process. How convenient is that?\n\nAnd speaking of which: Don't like the loot offered in any area? Not enough epics? No problem. Faust's Forest can be utilized to target specific gear drops you need, as entering and leaving the dungeon (remember, at absolutely no penalty) will refresh available loot in all areas. \n\nThe new combat consumables can also make some parts of the game easier, if you choose to use them or their original counterparts. Chocolates are a direct upgrade to both Purified Waters and Bandages, since you don't need to spend gold on them and they are immune to pollution. Donuts are a heal-over-time version of Potions — they're quite handy on all difficulties except Hard, as spike damage becomes a common issue to worry about. Doesn't mean they're useless, but fights often end quickly enough where you're either killing fast or on the receiving end of that treatment.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n[u]As a non-Guilty Gear fan:[/u] [b]Recommended[/b] and a [b]Non-Essential DLC[/b]. \n\nFor $5, it's a little bit of extra content that always remains relevant, whether you're at the beginning of your playthrough or near the end, and on any difficulty setting. Unfortunately, it's a bit short since the dungeon only has one area (a small one, at that) as opposed to three like every other. But like I said, it always remains relevant since the dungeon scales to the crew that enters it; it's meant to be replayed multiple times, not just once.\n\nIf you struggle with Hard Mode and/or dislike the stress associated with the Doomsday Clock, then the dungeon from this DLC may help alleviate some of your issues and make it bearable to play at the intended difficulty levels. The consumables are nice to have at hand and it's a great source of quick and easy equipment, especially if you're looking for good alchemy fodder to fuse into your primary crew's gear.\n\nHonestly, it's only a must-buy if you want to 100% this game. It's not asking for much, but you're not missing out either if you choose to skip this. If anything, Mistover needs more content-based DLC, so this is fine in my book.","timestamp_created":1595022842,"timestamp_updated":1595023955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w8K1r/MCfq/5lQI="}
