The game has plenty of enemies and bosses to fight as you strive to survive as long as you can chasing the almighty high score. \n\nThis is not going to be easy, but you knew what you signed up for when you bought this game on sale because you always read the descriptions, see the screenshots and check reviews like this one.","timestamp_created":1589022393,"timestamp_updated":1589022393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.688036620616912842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qrDH/PECfcLNhgI="}
