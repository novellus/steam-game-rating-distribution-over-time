    review: "This game has promise, that said, it needs a lot of work. The graphics\
      \ are what you see in the trailer, and presumably there are animals. But in\
      \ my two attempts, including one after a reinstall, I would hit countless invisible\
      \ walls which kept me in the mini area I guess the developer does hint at in\
      \ the description.\n\nAlso, you'll be jumping a lot of the tiniest bumps in\
      \ the ground. Maybe that's meant to simulate being in the park, but it was frustrating.\
      \ I managed to find and collect the trash, but if a bird was on the first map\
      \ I never saw it in over twenty minutes of searching. \n\nIt's OK if you want\
      \ to snap a few scenery pics, I guess, but the rest of the mini maps don't unlock\
      \ until you find the elusive bird. I don't know if the asset didn't load or\
      \ I just missed it. Also, this game really needs optimized. Something with these\
      \ graphics should run smooth as silk, even on a computer from the 90s.\n\nI\
      \ honestly can't recommend this game, even at the current price of $1.99 USD."
