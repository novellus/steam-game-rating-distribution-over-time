This is a match-3 game with several levels. Decent graphics and music. There's some story but it's just some fill and childish. \n\nNo bugs or crashes. Runs fine on win 7.\n\nThere are 3 modes to play and all are easy. This is a very casual game and pretty basic. Nevertheless, it's good for a few hours of fun without high expectations. Get it for cheap.","timestamp_created":1599104174,"timestamp_updated":1599104174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568558990955352783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+6iCqfQCfra7nwI="}
