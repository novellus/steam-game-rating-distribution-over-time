    review: 'My wife and I alternated ''driving'' the HMD and this made a great date
      night game, no joke.


      Real Escape Room - Have to wear clothes, go out, drive to and from (or car service
      for $), spend $20 per person, have to work with strangers.


      Virtual Escape: The Play Room - under $5, comfortable outfits, no driving (so
      get lit, party people), guaranteed trip to bj city and bangville afterward.


      No comparison, this game is an amazing deal.'
