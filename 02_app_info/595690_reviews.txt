She showed me how to farm and told me about yum and how tobe a good bb. She gave me clothes and put pies in my backpack and kept checking on me. Then it was time for her to die and her final song was playing. I cried :( Such a nice person I would never know if I met again. Lovely game with lots of crafting. Just make sure if you end up in a village without drama the next life could be better.","timestamp_created":1601146286,"timestamp_updated":1610010252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrtqF7vYCfoOhpAI="}
