    review: '[h1] A Great, But Rather Short Rhythm Adventure [/h1]

      Rhythm of the Gods, as you can probably tell from the title, is a rhythm game
      where you have to make your way through a slew of enemies and obstacles while
      following the music of several different gods that you meet along the protagonist,
      Lyrik''s, journey.


      [h1] The Good [/h1]

      -Although short, the story of the game is rather charming, and I liked reading
      through the dialogue the game had to offer.

      -The gameplay is simple, but can be very challenging depending on what difficulty
      you set.

      -The Marathon mode, which puts you through an endless gauntlet of obstacles,
      is really enjoyable to return to from time to time.

      -The music, while not mindblowing, is enjoyable to listen to while you are slashing
      your way through enemies.


      [h1] The Neutral [/h1]

      -I didn''t have trouble with it, but the game doesn''t tell you (At least in
      the main levels) which keys to press for each of the 4 actions you can perform.

      -There is no option (At the time) to change input/visual latency, but the sync
      was decent enough for me by default.

      -I had trouble running this on a decent PC at first, but it may have just been
      my specific setup. (This is where most of my playtime came from)

      -The trophies that the game gives you feel tacked on and unnecessary.


      [h1] The Bad [/h1]

      -The game is far too short. Other than the marathon mode, there are only 4 levels
      in the campaign, and they can all be beaten in around 15 minutes (In my experience).

      -Building off of the last point, because the game is very short, the difficulty
      curve is extremely steep.

      -The hi-res pixel art is a bit rough sometimes, and it makes me think that the
      game would have been better off using smooth art instead.


      [h1] Conclusion [/h1]

      Overall, Rhythm of the Gods gets a [u] [b] 6.5/10 [/b] [/u] from me for being
      fairly enjoyable, but a bit too short for the price point. If Lyrelark updates
      the game with features such as latency calibration and some more content for
      the campaign, I think this game has the potential to become something really
      great.'
