    about_the_game: '<strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br><br>Little Red Lie is a narrative-focused,
      interactive fiction experience that reduces the traditional nine-verb adventure
      game structure down to a single, context-dependent interaction: LIE.<br><br>Gameplay
      consists of navigating conversations and environments which will require you
      to lie to both others and yourself in order to secure your financial and personal
      future.<br><br>If you enjoy realistic and dramatic stories in a contemporary
      setting which deal with weighty issues of family, society and politics, Little
      Red Lie will offer a unique perspective into the subtle (and not-so-subtle)
      deceptions that shape our daily lives.<br><br><strong>STORY THEME: ARE YOU MORE
      AFRAID OF POVERTY THAN DEATH?</strong><br><br>If you grew up in the 1980s and
      1990s, you may have been shielded from the full weight of existence by a happy
      and prosperous middle-class family, as well as access to an education which
      seemed to imply that your own life would be similarly rich with possibility.<br><br>How
      is that going?<br><br><strong>LIE: THE ONLY VERB THAT MATTERS.</strong><br><br>Explore
      the contrasting characters and stories of Sarah Stone and Arthur Fox through
      a wide variety of dishonest interactions. And literally nothing else.<br><br><strong>SETTING:
      SCARS RUN DEEP</strong><br><br>Realistically told, and in a realistic place:
      The streets and landmarks of Scarborough, Toronto''s most notorious, misunderstood
      and fiercely proud suburb.<br><br><strong>TWO CHARACTERS, ONE FATE</strong><br><br>Living
      in a common time and place, Little Red Lie alternates you through the perspectives
      of two individuals who never meet, but who are deeply connected nevertheless.
      Explore the dynamics of their lives, relationships and decisions as both of
      them come face-to-face with the consequences of who they are and where they
      come from.'
