    review: 'The Card City Nights 2 - Soundtrack is a very smooth and chill mix of
      relaxing music. I very much enjoyed the music with the game and bought the soundtrack.
      Of course, the soundtrack isn''t for everyone, but it is best to buy the game
      first and enjoy the experience before buying the soundtrack.


      Card City Nights 2 - Soundtrack is a small mix of cool, funk and chill beats
      for any occasion.

      Card City Nights 2 - Soundtrack: 7/10
