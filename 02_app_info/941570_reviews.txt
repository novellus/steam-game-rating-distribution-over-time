Each new puzzle presents it's own challenges and there are sometimes multiple ways to solve the same puzzle if you look closely enough.  My only slight complaint is that the solutions to the puzzles feel cheap sometimes - like carrying a box sideways up a stair way that has purple box-blocking barriers, and then moving the mouse around until the box is in just the right position to be placed over the railing at the top.  My advice - not all solutions are elegant.  If you're stuck, try something that might seem stupid.  This is probably only about 5-10% of the puzzles in the game.\n\nThe story was decent and kind of funny at times.","timestamp_created":1610042551,"timestamp_updated":1610042618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiZaB7/YCesqqwQI="}
