    review: 'This was a nice little surprise. I''ve been a fan of these devs for awhile
      and decided to check this out after Max''s Big Bust. It''s a fairly meaty RPG/life
      management sort of game where you go fight monstergirls in another dimension
      while balancing personality stat building and dating sim bits. Think Persona
      but your main character is a bisexual magical girl with the power to summon
      cheese sandwiches.


      It''s a great effort for a team not used to balancing an RPG, just in terms
      of nailing a gameplay loop, partly thanks to the fun writing and characters.
      Brie is really fun as a lead, a good balance of normal and extremely strange
      at the least expected moments. The combat is simple, but that really clicks
      with me, offering just enough layers through the large party pool and the elemental
      system to not become boring. It''s a great game you can lose yourself in for
      a good chunk of time, and it has a lot of content to find and explore.


      Please consider purchasing this or the team''s other games (mainly the Max''s
      Big Bust visual novels), the main dev is currently working from a laptop since
      their main computer is down and I''d love for them to be able to repair or replace
      it to offer an update to this one. You can tell this one in particular was made
      with a lot of love and effort, the little flaws here and there just make me
      appreciate what it nails more (I kind of feel the same about the first Mass
      Effect''s jankiness).'
