Gabriel Knight 3 is set in a small village in France where you as Gabriel and Grace are investigating the abduction of an infant child. With an interface not seen in any other major point-n-click adventure (to my knowledge) where you hover around like a drone camera you can really immerse yourself in the environments of the game while investigating with great accuracy, As far as adventure games go, this game has it all, the plot is like any good Agatha Christie novel mixed with occult and religious elements. Add to this, extremely well done voice acting which made me laugh so many times, and great puzzles and a gallery of memorable characters, this game will make you want to check in to a hotel in rural France asap and start looking for clues and interrogating hotel guests. And yes, the music is amazing and superbly fits the game world. This game is one of my all time favorites, but you will probably need a open mind, if you start playing it in 2020. Please do.","timestamp_created":1605506027,"timestamp_updated":1605506256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyKno5/UCfvnVrgI="}
