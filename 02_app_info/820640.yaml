    about_the_game: When treasure is at stake, there are no heroes!<br>Race your way
      through challenging stages while contending with deadly creatures and dastardly
      opponents to collect the most treasure.<br><br>While everyone's goal is the
      same, each player is afforded several options to get an edge over their competitors.
      Players can use their speed and agility to outpace and evade their opponents,
      while others might use devastating attacks to slow them down and steal their
      hard earned goods.<br><br>If you're the type that prefers the solo experience
      or wants to get some experience in before challenging your friends, fear not!
      Aqua Lungers can be played with as few as 1 player! In single player, Aqua Lungers
      retains the gold collecting mechanic while increasing the penalty for deaths
      in each level. This shifts the challenge from PvP racing to PvE survival.<br><br>Be
