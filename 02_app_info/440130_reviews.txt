There are not enough around in my opinion and this one is worth the investment of money and time. I adore the characters and the hugely complex world of this game, it pulls on the heart-strings and leaves you wanting more.\n\nPROS:\n- The routes are all separate with completely different stories~!\n- You don't have to play all of the routes if you don't want to.\n- The sprites, BGs and CGs are GORGEOUS\n- The music is really really lovely!\n- World is expansive and so much world building\n- Characters are well thought out and interesting\n- 3 Good Ends and 3 Bad Ends.\n- QUALITY\n\nCONS:\n- The format is a little unusual and potentially confusing for buyers (which is why so many reviews are complaints that the game isn't free). The demo is free but you need to buy the guy's route separately and it downloads into the same game giving you access to it, Hikaru's route is in two parts, and for all the routes you also need to separately buy the epilogues. \n- May feel pricey because you're buying the bits separately but really isn't.","timestamp_created":1534781151,"timestamp_updated":1534781151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48bqFrOUCeNnzqAE="}
