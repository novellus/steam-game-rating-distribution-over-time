    about_the_game: Action, upgrades, and one cool cat wizard. Travel the galaxy as
      a mercenary with a fluffy dragon alongside a cast of endearing characters.<br><br>This
      game is a 2d action platformer with a retro-SNES vibe about it - so expect solid,
      tight controls with a slower movement speed for clarity of gameplay. I do tip
      my hand early and give good powerups early in the game - so expect to be traveling
      on the ceiling and one-shoting enemies once you get into the meat of the game.<br><br>Alongside
      the mechanics is a cast of characters that I really want to stand out - from
      a talking cat wizard to a skeleton in a kimono, you'll meet interesting tropes
      of NPCs, but then shortly after they will begin to surprise and grow on you
      - just like real people do. This is a huge focus for me personally that I strive
      for - a cast to remember.<br><br><strong>So, in short -</strong><br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Tight controls and movement<br></li><li>Great characters to
      love (or hate!)<br></li><li>Fluffy dragon you can pet as much as you want</li></ul>
