Spacedweller is somewhat reminiscent of the Atari 2600 game Stellar Track (which was for all intents and purposes Star Trek with the serial number filed off). Playing Spacedweller is like playing a really good, interesting board game (minus the hassles of setup and keeping the thing on the table for an extended period).","timestamp_created":1589641965,"timestamp_updated":1589643216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyNCHj/ICf+GRiAI="}
