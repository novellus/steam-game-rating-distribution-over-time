Quietly. Gently. Peacefully.\n\nFishing games seem like one of those genres that fit right in with VR. Not surprisingly, there are a lot of them. They come in all shapes and sizes, from attempts at pure realism to goofy novelty games. Catch and Release falls very comfortably in the middle, and that balance has made it my favorite VR fishing game.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a fishing simulator. It does not attempt to realistically teach you the ins and outs of actual real-world fishing. There are games that try to do that, with varying degrees of success. Those games are like trying to break into professional competitive fishing. Catch and Release is more like going fishing with your dad as a kid (or at least with my dad). It's chill. It's relaxed. There's a beer on the boat. You can't drink it.\n\nThe fish are not real-world specimens, but unique to the lake depicted in the game. They look good, though, and you can definitely see what they are referencing (I caught enough panfish with my dad to know that the Krapzy is a Crappie). You can weigh your fish and decide what to do with each. If you think it's small, you'll get more money for tossing it back, but if it's big, you'll get more money for keeping it. You have to learn what sizes are big and small for each species, so there is some trial and error involved. Use the money to buy new equipment. Nothing to serious; again, this isn't a simulator.\n\nYou'll be kept busy by an ever-updating list of objectives to complete. Finish off a batch and you'll get a reward, along with a new, more challenging to-do list.\n\nThe fishing itself is fine. Nothing fancy - cast, wait, fight, land. The fighting can be a bit tricky to learn. Remember to listen to the pole, and don't let the tension get too high. Slack the line if you need to; it's better to prolong the fight than lose the fish.\n\nThere is a radio in the game with some music loaded in, but I prefer to put on a podcast while I fish. It's a great way to relax.\n\nSummary:\nGraphics: 3/5\nImmersion: 4/5\nFun: 5/5\nComfort: 5/5\nFitness: 1/5\nBest Podcast: Behind the Bastards","timestamp_created":1609618527,"timestamp_updated":1609636054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6Dy4vYCd8XrvwI="}
