    about_the_game: Control your robot and survive in the wasteland world controlled
      by artificial intelligence.<br><br>You need to build strongholds and balance
      production, trading and transportation.<br>You have to deal with relationships
      with other strongholds, develop allies or conquer them.<br>You should control
      pollution and fight against acid rain, snowfall, sandstorm and other bad weather.<br>You
      have to fight against powerful enemy, build defense towers to protect your base,
      and send troops to destroy their strongholds.<br><br>This is an indie game.
      I made it in last two years. There's no beautiful picture, only the wasteland
      world and robots. However, this is another perspective of human civilization.
      Sometimes the complex world is simple, and sometimes the cold machine is warm.
      At present, there are 5 cities with different characteristics and difficulties
      to experience the game, and the whole game time is estimated to be more than
      200 hours.<br><br>Watch the trial video on YouTube:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/ofh6LCM73y4"

      class="bb_tag">GAME POSITIONING</h2>This is a construction and operation game
      that includes battles between strongholds. You need to balance the optimization
      of production efficiency and the improvement of military strength. The game
      is easy to play, but it's not easy to win in the end. Your stronghold won't
      die out because of a single defeat, but can be rebuilt quickly, which makes
      you always reach the final battle. But if the development is not fast enough,
      you will not win in the final battle. In fact, it is normal for ordinary players
      to win the final battle through multi-generations game. Some items can be inherited
      between generations to help you become stronger and stronger. At the same time,
      the world of each generation will be re-randomized, so the construction and
      development strategy will be different every time.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAME CONTENT</h2><ul
