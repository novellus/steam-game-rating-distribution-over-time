      \ /><br><br><i>Heart of the Woods</i> is a fantasy yuri visual novel about paranormal\
      \ investigation, ancient mysteries, and a love between two girls that transcends\
      \ life and death.<br><br>Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving\
      \ as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's\
      \ popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with\
      \ her own life.  But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the\
      \ mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural\
      \ crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange\
      \ young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal\
      \ phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they\u2019d ever seen\
      \ before.<br><br>However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them\
      \ bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she\u2019s never\
      \ been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim\
      \ of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding\
      \ Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can\u2019t explain, Abigail reveals\
      \ herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.<br><br>While\
      \ Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself,\
      \ Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than\
      \ any bond she\u2019s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail\u2019\
      s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends\
      \ to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly\
      \ than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.<br><br><img\
