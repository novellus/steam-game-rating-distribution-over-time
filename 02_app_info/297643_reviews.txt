The art is, yes, very nice, but this is not worth how much it costs.\n\nPros: \nNice art\nHas sprites, big character art, and just the faces. So cross-style compatability I guess.\nThere's a rad cowboy/girl hat.\nIncludes animations/a guide on how theirs work but that also leads to a small con. See below.\n\nCons:\nAnimations are a bit confusing to figure out - and while I commend them for even having this, there aren't enough options to justify making an animation. If I spend all this time figuring out how to make animations with your sprites and then I can't even use them to make a full-length game - what's the point?\nYou'll have to manually edit everything, if you were unaware of that. Every little piece of the characters is separate from eachother.\nNot many options as previously stated. Two female hair options with two recolours - while there's only ONE male option with two recolours.\n\nOverall: Just not enough content to make something with it. Not worth 8 dollars. If you really like it - get it on sale and make sure you have some drawing experience because you can't make due with only using what the pack offers.\nI'm in the process of a refund right now.","timestamp_created":1510587520,"timestamp_updated":1510587520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610096991062164307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwIqC298CeqSbiwE="}
