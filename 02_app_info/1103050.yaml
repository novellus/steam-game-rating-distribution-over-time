    review: 'Positives+++

      +Pieces snaps together and to the board.

      +One of the only puzzle game that I have seen that can snap on corners of two
      pieces together

      +Because snapping is so permissive, you can actually do something fun: drag
      and drop quickly over all other puzzle pieces and you will quickly get a whole
      chunk of the puzzle solved thanks to the far away autosnapping :P. Quite fun
      to do.

      +You have 5 hints you can use to help solve the puzzle.

      +"Shuffle" and "Center camera" option.

      +It''s nice to have a big surface area to work on the puzzle. Zoom is available
      too.

      +Puzzle save when you go back to puzzle selection menu


      Negatives---

      -UI is very ugly.

      -Music is annoying and reset when you begin a new puzzle. Music loop is very
      short and doesn''t loop properly, but anyway, I''m sure people will just end
      up muting it.

      -Annoying telephone ringing noises not relaxing when you snap a piece correctly
      to the board.

      -snapping is way too permissive. Snapping occurs when your pieces are about
      2 puzzle height away from the spot where it really belongs. There is no setting
      to change the snapping distance either.

      -When you drop a chunk of pieces snapped together, I don''t know why, but it
      goes behind some of the other loose puzzle pieces.

      -There is no visual indicator to know if you already complete a puzzle or not.

      -No achievements

      -Puzzle have a set difficulty, you can''t change it.

      -No confirmation to restart the puzzle

      -There is no indication of which puzzle is in progress.


      Even at his price, I can''t recommend the game at the moment because it''s just
      too easy with the autosnapping far away, also you can''t change the difficulty
      for images. With more work on it, it could be improved, but for the moment there
      is better puzzle game on steam to play.'
