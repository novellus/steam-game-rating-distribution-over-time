Quick thinking and quick reflexes are needed to maintain a good combo. The levels get quite interesting as additional colors are added. \n\nSmall issues:\n-I do wish there was a way to start at a higher level.\n\n-The default keyboard settings seemed very strange to me. They can be changed on the starting screen. \n\n-Also, I'm not sure why they didn't call it \"Puzzle Block Invasion\". \"Bloc\" is somewhat obscure (I assume it's a pun).","timestamp_created":1515173788,"timestamp_updated":1515174174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0+Pa4+ACcaePlQE="}
