    about_the_game: "Five years into the future, within a dusty town in New Mexico,\
      \ William Vest has been tasked with delivering a package of alien bone marrow.\
      \ Everything goes quickly awry as Vest learns his employer has used the marrow\
      \ as bait, to kill him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEscaping death, Vest finds himself\
      \ on the run with only two things that can save him - his complete lack of proper\
      \ scientific methodology, and a machine that can create creatures of pseudoscience,\
      \ or cryptids. Along with a few gruff and sarcastic companions, Vest completes\
      \ text adventure game puzzles and scenes in order to find valuable animal DNA\
      \ that he can then combine into creatures like Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster,\
      \ and the fur-bearing trout. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to creating these\
      \ creatures, the player can train and level them up throughout the game by fighting\
      \ other animals, thus increasing their attributes and ferocity. (At this point,\
      \ the game takes more of a hybrid-RPG form.) Once armed with a proper army of\
      \ fantastical creatures, the player can use them to defeat his enemies as the\
      \ cryptozookeeper."

    review: "This game is pretty excellent. It's basically an old-school text adventure\
      \ just like Infocom used to make them, except with weird pictures and cool music\
      \ (so maybe a bit more like Level 9, Legend or Magnetic Scrolls used to make\
      \ them), a ton of jokes, some violence and a strange & somewhat grindy RPG-lite\
      \ cryptid-fighting minigame. I don't think I'd recommend this to complete newcomers\
      \ \u2013 it's got some rough edges and tricky puzzles, so you should probably\
      \ be somewhat comfortable with the genre before trying it.\n\nBut I played it\
      \ for almost 20 hours, had a ton of fun with it, and now I'm sad that it's over.\
      \ Oh well."
