    about_the_game: '<strong>Puzzle Strike</strong> is a deckbuilding puzzle game
      played amongst Fantasy Strike characters. It''s inspired by puzzle games such
      as Puzzle Fighter. Gems fall into each player''s gem pile every turn, and whoever''s
      gem pile fills up first loses. Improve your deck (of chips!) by purchasing new
      chips as the game unfolds. Will you go heavy on economy, offense, or build an
      intricate engine? In any case, make sure to adapt to your opponents because
      Puzzle Strike has a lot more interactivity than most other deckbuilders. And
      like the other games in the Fantasy Strike universe, Puzzle Strike is designed
      to hold up to thousands of games at the expert level, and we fully embrace the
      philosophy of even-playfield competition.<br><br>The new Steam version of Puzzle
