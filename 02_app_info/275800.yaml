    review: "A nice couple of NSE liveries for the 319, one is the normal white/red/blue\
      \ and the other is grey/red/blue in both AC and DC modes. Pretty much what it\
      \ says and what you see on the tin is what you get in this pack. \n\nBut for\
      \ those that skip the content description the FCC 319 is REQUIRED for this to\
      \ work."
