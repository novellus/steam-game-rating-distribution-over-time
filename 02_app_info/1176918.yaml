    review: 'DLC sobre la guerra civil en Libia.A primera vista son solo 4 escenarios
      (que espero amplien por lo menos otros 2) pero tambien cuesta la mitad que los
      DLC anteriores, si bien son grandes y muy interesantes, incluyendo desde la
      captura del Coronel Gadafi hasta escenarios de lucha urbana.Dependiendo del
      bando y si se manejan fuerzas regulares o guerrilleros la tactica varia.

      La IA esta bien en ataque y en defensa.Muy Recomendado.'
