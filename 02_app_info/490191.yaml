    review: 'Nice addition to your collection of drum kits for Session Drummer 3.
      Although SONAR''s version comes with the Rhythm Machines for 404, 707, 808 and
      909, after adding Digital Sound Factory electronic kit, you have a much richer
      set of sounds. For instance, Addictive Drum set ''Reel Machines'' only has samples
      for the major components of these rhythm machines, such as: kick, snare, closed
      hihat, toms, crash cymbals and clap. This set is even easy to load into Rapture
      Pro and tweak some of the sounds even further. Well worth the asking price...'
