    review: 'Rocketron is a fun, fast-paced action game shaped like a metroidvania.
      I say that because the emphasis is certainly not on the Metroid-like bits: the
      map is simple and few of the upgrades give you actual new abilities. That''s
      fine, though, exploration adds interest to an already sharp action-platformer.
      Your rocket boost starts out as a glorified fart but after you find a couple
      fuel pickups it becomes the star of the show, letting you (with practice) easily
      weave through shmup-inspired bullet barrages. It''s a simple movement ability
      but a blast to use.


      It''s the weapon system that''s likely to turn you off, if anything does. Rather
      than encouraging you to switch weapons by making you manage ammo, Rocketron
      gives each of your (up to) 6 good weapons a life bar. When you take a hit, whatever
      weapon you have out also takes damage. Grab a life pickup from a blown-up baddie
      and all your damaged weapons get (very slightly) repaired. If a weapon reaches
      zero life it''s broken until you fill its life meter from 0 to full, and even
      that just restores it to a critically low level of health, making you fill the
      meter a second time to get it back to peak condition. I wanted to get into that
      much detail because while I greatly enjoyed the game including this system,
      I know a lot of players would be frustrated with a mechanic that punishes you
      for getting hit by taking your weapons away. So: recommended, but only if that
      sounds like something you can live with.'
