    review: "An sich ist das Spiel in Ordnung, allerdings sollte unbedingt an manchen\
      \ Begriffen in den Wimmelbildern gearbeitet werden. Folgende Suchbegriffe wurden\
      \ meiner Meinung nach falsch benannt:\nLinks Suchbegriff - Rechts tats\xE4chliches\
      \ Bild(Gegenstand)\nTriangel - zum Dreieck gefaltete Serviette\nVentilator -\
      \ F\xE4cher\nRohr - Pfeife zum Rauchen\nTasse - Regenschirm\nFledermaus - Baseballschl\xE4\
      ger\nJ\xE4ger - Zahl 2\nSchnur - Kabel\nTeller - Deckel oder eine art Kuchenglocke\n\
      Chemikalie - Reinigungsspray \nPullover - Babybody\nSahne - Creme Dose\nBand\
      \ - G\xFCrtel\nMundharmonika - w\xFCrde sagen es sollte eine Art Akkordeon oder\
      \ \xE4hnliches darstellen.\n\nAnsonsten ist das Spiel recht gut f\xFCr Anf\xE4\
      nger in dem Bereich point and click games."
