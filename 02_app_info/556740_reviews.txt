Everything in the first 30 minutes of the game is bad. \n\nThis is by far the first game ever which left me confused after its first tutorial. Honestly, the tutorials are so bad that it physically hurt my brain. I didn't even know how to open game menu until I opened the settings and read the key bindings. And even that confused me. Yes, even the game setting menu is confusing.\n\nGameplays are mediocre. The mechanics are as old as Turn-based RPG itself. But somehow the devs managed to displayed it in a way which would have your mind lost somewhere in the underworld. It is clunky and unappealing.\n\nThe art style is acceptable but the UI and UX is a disaster. You'll have to widen your eyes and focus to look for any and everything. Nothing you want to find is easy to find. I mean NOTHING.\n\nI have to mute the game from the start so can't say anything about the sound and music.\n\nAll in all, please think very very carefully before trying this game. It may traumatised you.","timestamp_created":1609993607,"timestamp_updated":1609993607,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49ZrG7fYCc4KYwQI="}
