    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TO BE HUMAN IS TO SUFFER.</h2><br>Suffering\
      \ comes in many forms but <strong><u>mental suffering</u></strong> is the most\
      \ widespread. Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Worry, Grief, a huge amount\
      \ of mental illnesses (OCD, ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, Psychoses, etc).<br><br>Meditation\
      \ and other mindfulness techniques can and will reduce the amount of mental\
      \ suffering. These techniques, once learned, will stay with you forever. They\
      \ will help you enjoy a more <u><strong>peaceful and happier life.</strong></u><h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Gamitate is designed to help you in 2 ways:</h2><br>1) Teach\
      \ you as many techniques as possible in an easy and FUN way. <br>2) Provide\
      \ you with a pleasant environment to practice various meditation and mindfulness\
      \ techniques.\_<br><br>The techniques taught in this game come from a variety\
      \ of sources: personal experiences, books, articles, etc. Some of them will\
      \ work better for you than others. We\u2019re all cut from a different cloth\
      \ so it\u2019s perfectly normal.\_<br><br>You don\u2019t need to \u201Cmaster\u201D\
      \ each and every meditation technique. Just go through them all and stick with\
      \ the ones that work best in your specific case.\_<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WARNING:</h2><br>Meditation\
      \ doesn\u2019t replace medication and therapy.\_<br>If you suffer from a mental\
      \ illness visit a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist.\
      \ <strong>Don\u2019t stop taking your prescribed medication</strong> unless\
      \ your doctor tells you to.\_<br><br>It may be tempting to try to \u201Ccure\
      \ yourself\u201D through meditation but it\u2019s always a bad idea, especially\
      \ if you suffer from a serious mental disorder.\_<br><br>Please be aware that\
      \ there are a handful of articles and studies\_which say that for a small number\
      \ of people meditation may be harmful. If you experience negative side effects\
      \ from meditation please STOP immediately."
