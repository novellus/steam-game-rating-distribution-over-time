    review: 'I actually have more than 5 minutes in this game it''s just for some
      reason, to play it, I have to use a launcher outside of Steam as there seams
      to be a broken communication there. So if you also have that problem, Just find
      the game on your computer and open it that way. It plays it just fine!


      Now that that''s out of the way, this is a hilarious dumpster fire of a game.
      There are just some games that are so bad they are good and I genuinely believe
      this is one of them. I get everyone has different tastes but really, just go
      into this game not taking it seriously and the ending will send you over the
      fucking top, howling with laughter. XD'
