It felt like the whole game was waiting in line at the dmv. There are about 5 main rooms you are going to be walking back and forth through and let me break down how these rooms work. And remember this game is 30$\n\nEach of the rooms will have 6-7 exits only 1 of which will be open to you, the rest will be either locked doors or have invisible walls blocking your path. You proceed through the only exit that allows you to leave and perform a mundane task such as grabbing a med kit or checking to see if an elevator has power (spoiler it doesn't.). Afterwards you travel back to the first room and proceed through another exit. Another stupid check, another new exit. The whole game is walking back and forth among a few rooms and every once in awhile you have to fight a zombie which is beyond fucking buggy.\n\nCombat happens one of two ways. Either you go toe to fucking toe with the zombie and just throw haymakers until one of you drops or you will have to bug the zombie by attacking him then moving to the right so you can glitch into them a bit. Several times you and the zombie will attack each other and you'll both die. Also dont bother trying to run the zombies melee swing has a stupid far range on it.\n\nGraphics were not to be shabby but the sound. Oh the sound. Or I guess I should say the lack of it. You will only hear a few things throughout the game. A crunching sound that happens when you do almost anything, like opening doors, putting on a band aid, or walking up to a knife. The other sounds are an ambient rain that only happens on loading screens and running water that happens in one of the rooms. Other than that pure silence. Oh and also the main character is voiced by a text to speech program so there's that.\n\nThis is an incredibly shallow game that has intentional obstacles to stretch out the length. If you were able to freely explore the game could be finished in 10 minutes instead of an hour.","timestamp_created":1604972042,"timestamp_updated":1605136742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.649079740047454834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw597m3PUCdt26rQI="}
