      /><br><strong>Inseparable </strong>is the highly cooperative pc game for two
      players (on one keyboard). Playing solo is also possible. Placed in a fantasy
      world with a vintage style. This game is a fusion of adventure and action.<br>The
      entire game is made by one person.<br> <br>Game story:<br>One experiment goes
      wrong and the undetected virus spread across the area. Some peoples get infected,
      some back from the dead, and new creatures are born. When people have no idea
      how to turn this back, the Doctor in his laboratory discovers a special weapon
      to fight with these different opponents... a laser! He connects himself with
      his best friend and also the most effective hunter in the village to start the
      adventure together.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1405270/extras/goal2.jpg?t=1604687899"
      /><br>The main mechanic is both players are connected and need to cooperate
      closely playing on one keyboard. Nowadays those types of games are less popular
      than a few years ago, but I have a fondness for times when with family and friends
      we played together on one computer on one keyboard. It was awesome, fun and
      we can spend some time with each other. One of the main goals of this indie
      game is to remind you of these times.<br><br><strong>So invite your partner
