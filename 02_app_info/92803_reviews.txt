For assembling complex molecules, this feels like a chore and one step back.  The teleport mechanic adds new contraints while taking away the flip flop mechanic, which I have pretty much gotten so used to having finished the base game and completed more than a couple dozens of research net puzzle.\n\nI think the dlc is not that bad given the price. I bought it on sale to get the last achievement. Only buy this if you really like spacechem.","timestamp_created":1606622195,"timestamp_updated":1606691572,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkvmRi/YCftj4tAI="}
