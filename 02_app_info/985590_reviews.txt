With so many games out there, it's hard to stand out even when a game , while having flaws, pales compared to even other indie game projects out there. Necrolepsy however does enough to be worth its 10 dollar price tag, with the idea of where the project has come from. There's some good core elements with the psuedo combo system here, and there's a good understand of the basics of platforming action. It is rough around the edges, as certain enemies can easily be cheesed and there are some effects that can cause some motion sickness (however as I write this its being changed in an upcoming patch). There's some ideas that don't entirely work mind you: the nightmare mode doesn't feel like its really taking advantage of the idea, and sometimes the game can be a little bit easy.\n\nWith that said, the game has this sorta newgrounds+flash charm that you can't help but start to smile at. Certain enemies are straight forward, but it also feels like they were built from the ground up, influenced by games like Mega Man and Castlevania, but built by the creators two hands. Lira is a goofy protagonist and there are goofy villians, and yet you sit there cracking smiles left and right. The fact that updates for problems have come at a steady rate shows a developer that's definitely listening to feedback, and is wanting to make a game that people enjoy. It's not going to blow you out of the water, but it's also going to make you appreciate the work put in. It's solid control wise and the mechanics all work and do provide for some higher level skill play, especially with the idea of combos toward the mid segments of the game.\n\nIt's a game that you should try the demo out for, and if you enjoy it, definitely give the game a try. \n\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCOGxK9Ccm0 \n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A charming style and quirky writing style leads to a game that you want to succeed, even if its rough around the edges. \n[*] Good basic enemy design and style while keeping low key in terms of the design itself (not overly flashy)\n[*] You can tell that a dedication was put into certain animations, and the game can be really cool when showing off these.\n[*] Core world design and mechanics do the job and the game is appropriately priced.\n[*] Controls do well for the world created here. \n[*] Do like a boss battle or two even if they may be considered on the easy side.\n[*] Like our main character and the idea of necrolepsy is an interesting one that drives the plot home.\n[*] Like the secondary weapons and their basic uses.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's an overall lack of oompf at times, the game does show its roots as a first game by a solo developer. \n[*]  Rough around the edges with little glitches here and there, that the dev is addressing, but it's something that you keep on running into.\n[*] The necrolepsy timer needs more oompf to it in the normal mode to make it feel like an actual threat. \n[*] I admit I completely forgot that I had a stun weapon until the dev literally told me about it. Stunning feels overpowered at times.\n[*] You're not exactly sure what items do without going to the in-game store, and overall there's more description that can be used in general.\n[*] The in-game map not showing doors can be really confusing especially when exploration doesn't seem to be one of the games themes with the timer element.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
