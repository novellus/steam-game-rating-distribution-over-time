    about_the_game: In Tyrannis, you play as the commander of either an army of overstretched
      mercenaries or an outnumbered rebel force across a dystopian America.<br><br>Tyrannis
      features twenty-one regions for you to defend or liberate, twenty-seven different
      factions with different abilities to encourage different strategies, as well
      as an AI with a modifiable aggression, offensiveness, and randomness on a per-player
      basis.<br><br>All for you and up to seven other players to fight with in local
      or online multiplayer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br>Tyrannis' turn-based
      strategic gameplay pits armies of overstretched mercenaries against outnumbered
      rebel forces. Through asymmetric gameplay, the mercenaries will run Search and
      Destroy missions to hopefully root out the rebels, while the rebels themselves
      work to raid their enemies and liberate the country from the Caesar's hired
      guns.<br><br>Or if neither side is able to achieve a decisive victory, the players
      controlling the most regions or states will decide the victors.<h2 class="bb_tag">Online
      Multiplayer</h2><br>While up to eight players can play on the same computer,
      Tyrannis has an online multiplayer that can connect up to eight players with
      only the host's IP address. And a save file, should the players want to continue
      where they left off.<br><br>Of course, should one of the players be unable to
      make it to the next session, the other players can always replace them with
      an AI to hold the fort until then.<h2 class="bb_tag">Post-Launch Content</h2><br>Tyrannis'

      notes: "While Tyrannis depicts little to no violence in the gameplay, the story\
        \ contains violence, as well as alcohol abuse, child abuse, and some mentions\
        \ of suicide.\r\n\r\nMoreover, references to sexual assault/non-consensual\
        \ sex are somewhat present in the story, but are present nonetheless."

    review: An absolutely kickass game with a lot of potential. Not only is the gameplay
      great, but the story and all of the intel reports are top class. Since this
      was made by a TNO dev, it has a distinct TNO-type vibe to it that I absolutely
      love.
