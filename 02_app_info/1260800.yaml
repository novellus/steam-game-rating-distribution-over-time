    review: "Leave the Mechanics as it is. Though you may add a virtual stationary\
      \ position for when the guitars are held. it would make it easier for controllers\
      \ like the vive wands to slide down the notes on high difficulties.\n\nAlso,\
      \ adding a double toggle on the grip to release instruments and to set up their\
      \ virtual positions, would greatly help with accidental grip inputs. those accidental\
      \ inputs make you release the guitar and throws off your notes. \n\nLast, you\
      \ should be getting more musical content for joining the Valve Family. In its\
      \ current state, i'd say its worth $30 with more DlC in the format of music\
      \ worth their natural store price from .99c to 1.99c per song. This gives all\
      \ artists full royalties for their music and they pay 10% of that to maintain\
      \ the songs on the servers.\n\nTake a trip to Warner Music Distribution. They\
      \ will be aware of your visit. you should update your catalog to match our library."
