But I see no reviews, no discussions. Hm... Ok, I'll jump into the water and see if it swims! :)\n\nAnd it does! Nice match block game with a different mechanic (store page explains it well, plus it starts with a tutorial).\n\nUnity launcher with settings for different resolutions and window/fullscreen mode!\n\nSeparate music and sound toggles.\n\nA weird slider for language. It starts in German for some reason, even though my Steam and my OS are English. With the 2nd attempt I managed to handle the slider correctly and make it English. :)\n\nNo timer, so far, play in peace, no stress.\n\nAfter a few levels it points out the limited moves to reach the level goal.\n\nIf there's anything else I'll add it, but for now I want to add a review with the basic info I hoped to find. :)","timestamp_created":1542921389,"timestamp_updated":1542921389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.658824920654296875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vIDSnucCcIycsQE="}
