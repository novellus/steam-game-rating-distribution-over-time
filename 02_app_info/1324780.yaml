      wants from a World War 2 Game: <strong>Simulation</strong> in weapons and movements,

      and a <strong>realistic combat</strong> approach. <br><br>In this new version
      of Easy red we wrote everything from scratch to reach quality in game mechanics,
      and optimization to manage a new great looking design running even on low end
      machines.<br>And we are taking you in <strong>Italy</strong>, from the shores
      of <strong>Anzio</strong>, to the bombed peaks of <strong>Montecassino</strong>,
      and in <strong>Japan</strong> in the middle of the Battle for <strong>Kwajalein</strong>.<br>And

    review: 'Nice generic FPS set in WWII. Being Early Access, there isn''t all that
      much to play yet but it''s coming along. The graphics are not overwhelming but
      OK for the price. One thing that takes some getting used to is that the controls
      differ slightly from most FPSs.


      Definitely worth it for anyone who wants to relive the classic Battlefield Series
      or is looking for a nice FPS to play in between.'
