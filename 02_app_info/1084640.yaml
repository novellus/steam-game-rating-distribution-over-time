      \ to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. <br>Collect tons\

      \ has a weirdly-stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and\

      <strong>Policenauts</strong>, <strong>Snatcher</strong>,\_<strong>L.A.Noire</strong>,\_\
      <strong>Aviary Attorney</strong>\_or the\_<strong>Tex Murphy</strong>\_series.\_\
      The game was also heavily influenced by animated features like Porco Rosso,\
      \ Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the series: BoJack Horseman. <br><br>The noir mood\
      \ is enhanced by an original musical score, backed up by\_professional voice\

    review: going to be honest with this one, came in with my bar pretty low, but
      was extremely surprised to find quiet a good murder mystery (which I'm personally
      a sucker for) there was only one puzzle that frustrated me (the one with the
      insignia for anyone reading this after having played) but other than that most
      of the puzzles keep the challenge level pretty good
