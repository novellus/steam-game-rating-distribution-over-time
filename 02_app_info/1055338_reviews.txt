The loop tracks for the grain elevators are a nice touch as well. For those that love road crossings this is for you as they are in abundance. Recycled sound software course, easy fix using searchlights sound packs. Overall great route and a real bang for your buck.","timestamp_created":1607339820,"timestamp_updated":1607339820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvui6nvYCc+b5twI="}
