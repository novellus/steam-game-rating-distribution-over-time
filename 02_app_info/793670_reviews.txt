I also had *no* money, so I had to make due with mods for games that I already owned if I wanted something new to play. Half-Life 1 mods consisted of the majority of these. I poured countless hours into The Trenches, Sven Coop, Firearms, The Specialists, and The Wastes. Out of all of those, The Wastes was the one that struck the right chords with me: the electrifying gunplay, the great art and sound design, and the fantastic post-apocalyptic atmosphere that all of the maps had. All of the controls for that mod are permanently burned into my muscle memory, and I practically know every little detail that all of maps and weapons had. \n\nUnfortunately, The Wastes community was tiny when I discovered it in 2005, but I managed to play it regularly with some people. Fast forward to 2016 - I'm looking around on Mod DB and I notice a news article announcing that The Wastes is being ported to a variation of the Quake 3 engine whilst being revamped and reworked. I could not believe what I was seeing, and after I read that article, I felt like I was a kid again. When the new iteration of The Wastes was released roughly two years later, that feeling came back in force, despite the fact that the first release had some significant bugs that were eventually patched out. Regardless, those blemishes did not diminish the wave of nostalgia I had. \n\nWe live in an age of cookie-cutter AAA games today; the age of highly ambitious multiplayer Half-Life or Quake total conversions is largely gone. All AAA multiplayer FPS games today are alike in some way or another; none of them have the vision or creativity that were made by people trying to find their footing in the world of game development and not having to worry about suits restricting their work. If you want to know what mods for games like Half-Life or Quake were like circa 2002, give this game a try.\n\nThese Vera Visions peeps are some real crazy motherfuckers, and I love it. Reviving a highly obscure Half-Life 1 mod (and putting it in a new engine) that's loved by only a select few - this is the shit I live for.","timestamp_created":1597563504,"timestamp_updated":1597564492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475934267044067383","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjvOQ+/MCf7LjmwI="}
