    about_the_game: '<i>&quot;A mixture of inspirations from Team Fortress 2, Doom,
      Quake, and even Overwatch, using only Water Splashes. Every part of the game
      redefines the Shooter genre.&quot;</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Trianga''s Project:
      Battle Splash 2.0 (or Battle Splash 2.0 for short) is an Epic Fast-Paced, Bullet-Dodging,
      Competitive, Team-Based Third Person Shooter that Creatively Redefines the Shooter
      Genre with No Killing, No Blood, No Violence, and full Water Splashes Physics.
      Fight against Dozen of Enemies, Dodging thousands of Bullet while facing off
      Giant Robot, all At-The-Same-Time! Your Class may be your Fate, your Actions
      and Skills may change your Destiny, yet your Tactic will shape your Path to
      Victory!</h2><br><br>Battle Splash tells a story about Trianga Polyga, who created
      a Virtual/Augmented Reality system that could simulate real-life experience/environment
      in an enclosed area, called &quot;Brainwave Oriented Simulation System (or B.O.S.s)&quot;.
      She then wrote &quot;Battle Splash&quot;, a game inside B.O.S.s that features
      high speed Water Balloons and Water simulation in order to create the most intense
      Squirt Gun Battle ever. She then invited her friend (Temiko Kangara), her cousin
      (Pentaga Polyga) and her sister (Quadra Polyga) to test the game out. After
      an unexpected journey due to a bug during the test, she then further improved
      the game, and made the second version of it: &quot;Battle Splash 2.0&quot;.<br><br>The
      game is designed to be as Easy to Play as possible, while still keeps the best
      features of Classic Arena Shooter and Class-based Shooter. Battle Splash''s
      gameplay heavily relies on Water Splash Mechanic, which changes the shape of
      the Splash Explosion depending on the surrounding area. In addition, the game
      is fully Physics-based, leading to Ballistic Bullets, Bouncing Balloons and
      lots of Physics features, thus feel free to perform some &quot;Redefined&quot;
      old tricks from Arena Shooter such as Bullet Dodging, Rocket Jump or Balloons
      Hop.<br><br>For even more diversity in gameplay, player can take control of
      the 4 playable Characters, which represent 4 different Classes in the game.
      Each character has their own Stats and Abilities that when combined with each
      Weapon they can further improve their performance or change their role in battle
      in real-time. Weapons'' behavior can also change in real-time thus even more
      combinations can be carried out.<br><br>However, without a proper Tactic, your
      Victory cannot be ensured. Carefully Organize your team, Analyze necessary information,
      and Carry out your plan perfectly are the keys to success. There are many Paths
      players can take in order to achieve the Ultimate Victory. Be Flexible, or be
      Determined, or be Open-minded about your Approaches.<br><br>Key Features:<br><ul
