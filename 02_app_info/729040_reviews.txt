I liked the game and the humor so I thought I'd get Borderlands 1 to get all the back story. Well there isn't much. In fact, the 2nd game is almost exactly the same as the first. I'm talking stupid similar but with a better interface and more polish. They should have just called it Borderlands The Remake.\n\nIn 2020, it is not worth going back to play Borderlands 1. There isn't enough content difference to merit it.
