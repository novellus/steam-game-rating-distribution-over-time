    review: The fact they were selling this for 7 dollars is obscene even though i
      only paid half price. i thought it had a good concept and nice art but it was
      INCREDIBLY short and i actually talked to everyone granted im sure they meant
      it for multiple replays but even still i was expecting multiple choices of who
      dies continually developing the plot over time. what i got was one choice then
      it ends and tells you the results of your conversations and who you choose...what
      a rip off. If they had gone to the trouble of actually having a progressing
      story i think this game could have had potential(and this is the EXTENDED CUT...wtf
      was the normal cut like).
