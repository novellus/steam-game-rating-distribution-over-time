It has 6DOF movement, but On-Rails combat by rubberbanding the enemies to always be in your FOV. You're also expected to solve switch puzzles and avoid stage hazards as the enemies orbit around you. Heath does not refill and if you use the boost to dodge a projectile the game fires you into a offscreen asteroid causing you to take damage anyway. It's as if the developer wanted to play every arcade shooter simultaneously.\n\nThe horrible mouse implementation makes this super frustrating to play. There's a hard coded inverse acceleration curve causing small movements of the mouse to be exaggerated, while large movements are dampened or ignored.","timestamp_created":1608773827,"timestamp_updated":1608773827,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532224535942077637","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m4+ZyfYCdoPSvAI="}
