    about_the_game: "Disgrace is an action adventure game that can certainly require\
      \ a lot of thinking from the player. Done intentionally so as not to be too\
      \ intuitive, the player will have to rely on their observation and deductions\
      \ in order to progress in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe same goes for some\
      \ bosses, requiring strategy in order to pierce their defenses or weaknesses\
      \ in order to defeat them. It is a game made to be mysterious, its secrets and\
      \ its history can be revealed to the player if he is attentive or even if he\
      \ finds the secrets hidden on the map. Namely that the end can change the actions\
      \ of the player himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter all, every action has its\
      \ consequences, whether good ... or bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt also features\
      \ a horror-style first-person-view multiplayer launched on the eve of Halloween\
      \ and available all the time, featuring the objective of stalking a ghost through\
      \ a map using a tablet and cameras."
