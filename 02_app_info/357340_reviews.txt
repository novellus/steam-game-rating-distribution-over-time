This game is better than almost anything I've experienced and I have no clue why it's so underrated.\n\nSeriously, it throws almost all the flaws of other combat games out of the window, making strategy a big part of the game. \n\nForget having to react quickly, cobalt lets you slow down time and kick a grenade back into your enemy's face if you know what to do, or smack an unsuspecting predator mech with a chrono rod a billion times to slow it down, then fire a storm of bullets at it... or even fire a bullet at a bouncy pad to redirect it back up to a plug to hit it exactly the right way so that it will bounce into the goal...\n\n(of course, stuff like time dilation and available weapons can be messed around with and changed based on your preferences)\n\nOh, and there's tons of maps. Not all of them are masterpieces but some of them are total classics. Not to mention the giant list of community-made maps and the pretty easy-to-learn level editor.\n\n\nSeriously, every single time I fire up this game and play a survival match, a combat challenge, or whatever it is, crazy things happen that would never be experienced in any other combat game.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a banger.\n\n\nThe only cons I could think of were:\n\n- Barely anyone in the online servers (playing with friends via remote play or locally is more fun anyway)\n\n- Local profiles are a little bit buggy and sometimes copy names\n\nTL;DR Best combat game I've played so far, extremely underrated. Get a friend or two and do remote play, you won't regret it. Just don't try to find online matches","timestamp_created":1608740813,"timestamp_updated":1609988441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4usCy7fYCe8vCvAI="}
