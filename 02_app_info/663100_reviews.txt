Oh boy, do I have a game for you.\n\nSort of a space sim hidden gem IMO. Game is short, but excels in what it is trying to do. Physics in this game is very good; and it has simple but good soundtrack and sound effects (I think most indie games fail in that point), although I run into some weird sound clipping when starting the game that stabilizes through time.\n\nThere are other games with good newtonian physics (Independence Wars for example), but they are mostly 6DoF, and have some sort of automatic assist. There is nothing, as far as I know, similar to Thrust & Shoot.\n\nWould love to see more content for this game.\n\nedit: errors","timestamp_created":1572458223,"timestamp_updated":1602182624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522357702255249023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsNbhhPUCcd+i1QE="}
