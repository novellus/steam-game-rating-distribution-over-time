    review: 'Do I recommend this DLC? Yes. For $7 it''s a bit pricey for three new
      levels, but the DLC bundle 2 gives you three DLC for $14, which I think is the
      better option to go for and saves you a little bit of money.


      So what did I think of the new levels?


      Farm 51 has added a version of Prison that isn''t difficulty locked, unlike
      in the original. This is a good change, as I never really liked how levels were
      locked behind difficulty in the original. Other than that, it''s mostly a straight
      port, with a few visual flairs and decorations added here and there. Good level
      in the original, still a good level now.


      City is where the DLC starts to shine. For starters, the zombies you fight throughout
      the level have got a graphical update that makes them feel more unique than
      the reskinned plague victims from the original game. The level itself has received
      a nice visual overhaul as well. In the original, it was mostly a flat, grey
      level. Here, ash now rains from the sky, a new skybox gives it some nice visual
      flair, and the textures now have a bit more detail. The level is mostly the
      same gameplay wise, including the annoying fire escape jumping section about
      halfway through. The final miniboss fight has also been changed, but this is
      mostly for the better.


      Pentagon has also been updated. The original wasn''t a very good level to begin
      with, so any change is positive. It''s received a nice visual overhaul, with
      new lights, a giant spinning fan, and other little visual flairs that break
      up what was mostly a concrete box in the original. Instead of fighting the Panzer
      Spider right off the bat, you first have to spend some time killing a couple
      waves of enemies, which is a good way to increase the level''s play time and
      get the player a few extra hitpoints for the final fight.


      Overall, I enjoyed this DLC and would recommend it. My only real complaint is,
      again, the lack of ability to backtrack through levels after fights to gather
      supplies and look around. City and Pentagon were already like this in the original,
      but Prison especially was always a level I liked to wander through. Beyond that,
      I think they should have re-designed Pentagon to be more of an actual level
      instead of one big arena, but I respect that they were simply trying to bring
      the original level to Hell and Damnation.'
