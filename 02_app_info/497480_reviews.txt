IN SPACE!\n\nHit the balls out of the arena to clear them.\n\nThere is some extras like bombs, which are trickier to clear than normal balls.\n\nThere is local turn based multiplayer, which I haven't tried out yet.\n\nWould love to see some bots to play against, and some online multiplayer in the future.","timestamp_created":1482462290,"timestamp_updated":1482462290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549180328845977783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhezolNkCfdvybA=="}
