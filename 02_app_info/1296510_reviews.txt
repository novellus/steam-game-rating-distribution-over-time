I recommend this, as long as you have an open mind. But if you're curious on what I'd rank these demos, well here you go:\n\n[h1] [b] 10. Rotgut [/b] [/h1]\nSuper glitchy (my friend fell through the map and the game said he won) with horrendous texture issues, with practically nothing going on. Even the achievement didn't know what to say for this \"accomplishment\".\n\n[h1] [b] 9. Don't Go Out [/b] [/h1]\nVery RNG-reliant, this turned-based survival/card game could have been more. With a great NES style, this had everything going for it, but unfortunately it simply doesn't have much to offer.\n\n[h1] [b] 8. Summer Night [/b] [/h1]\nLittle arcade game that has a slowly depleting battery that causes shenanigans to ensue. I don't know why everybody hypes this one up, it was alright, even after the batteries died.\n\n[h1] [b] 7. The Pay Is Nice [/b] [/h1]\nCool story, but feels way too short (admittedly, they did only have 7 days to make this). Love the sound design here.\n\n[h1] [b] 6. Outsiders [/b] [/h1]\nCool gameplay loop and concept, just a bit frustrating to navigate the field though. Very polished and the way the house progressively deteriorates every run is great.\n\n[h1] [b] 5. Hand of Doom [/b] [/h1]\nVery short but charming game. Story is nothing to be impressed by, but I loved the ES: Arena/Daggerfall style.\n\n[h1] [b] 4. Carthanc [/b] [/h1]\nLOVED the aesthetics in this, but the gameplay is really clunky, and a bit frustrating at first. Also, everything is extremely loud for no reason. Concept is cool enough.\n\n[h1] [b] 3. Shatter [/b] [/h1]\nGreat world-building present here, and I love the PSX style. Would love to see more from this, if the developers ever decide to continue.\n\n[h1] [b] 2. The Pony Factory [/b] [/h1]\nFrom the developer of DUSK (and recently Squirrel Stapler), you should already know this one'll be good. Polished shooting mechanics and a great atmosphere, as well as some genuinely disturbing enemy designs, this is one of my favorites demos in this collections. Story felt a bit cheesy though (but what can I say, it's a game called \"pony factory\").\n\n[h1] [b] 1. Mr. Bucket Told Me To [/b] [/h1]\nI don't know why I loved this as much as I did. Maybe it was the charming writing, the surprisingly pleasing visual style, or the polished survival mechanics (hunger, hydration, cleanliness, excrement, and stamina), but for the little time these developers had, they made a very polished and very fun game, one that I would love a follow-up to.","timestamp_created":1609731434,"timestamp_updated":1609778035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k++P5/YCffmjwAI="}
