The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"The Lodgers of House 13\" is the first episode of \"Twilight Phenomena.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, it comes with extra features that are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced; Hard and Custom.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is no map in this game. The player has to remember where to go in the game.\n\nThere is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nThere are thirteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Wallpapers; Screen Saver; Cinematic Scenes and Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1602604560,"timestamp_updated":1602604560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578561663627624512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6J2rkfUCfcXTpwI="}
