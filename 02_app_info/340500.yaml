    review: "Game is too old school for its own good.\nI got past the keyboard only\
      \ control system. \nI managed to get my eyes used to the horrid graphics on\
      \ fullscreen.\nI even was able to navigate around the 1980's UI.\nBut...\n\n\
      I took my team adventuring from the Outpost and got lost in a snowstorm. I mean\
      \ I got totally lost.\nNo compass. No map of any sort. \nEach area looks the\
      \ same.... while snow covered. \nSpent the next half hour going from one screen\
      \ to another not knowing if i was getting anywhere, I even somehow managed to\
      \ get back to the Outpost, but guess what, they wont let me back in!\nSo back\
      \ to the snow covered maze.\nAnother half hour spent wandering around aimlessly,\
      \ loading up previous saves as my team was constantly getting annihilated.\n\
      Rage quit. \nMy gaming time is more important to me than being wasted on this\
      \ monstrosity."
