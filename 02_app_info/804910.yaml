    about_the_game: "Mine Seeker is a game of wits, speed and a little luck. A new\
      \ puzzle game where your goal is to clear all the tiles, except the ones that\
      \ have a mine. If a tile has a numbered space, that indicates how many mines\
      \ are adjacent to that tile. This allows you to clear the tiles while trying\
      \ to figure out where the mines are. However you are also timed and must be\
      \ quick in figuring out where the mines are to avoid exposing one and making\
      \ it explode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith 180 fun and addicting levels with increasing\
      \ difficulty, its sure to keep you guessing for a long time. A scoring system\
      \ that keeps track of your scores and number of stars for each level. There\
      \ is also a quick play for a more casual environment that lets you select a\
      \ difficulty and is not timed. Don't forget about the 24 achievements you can\
      \ earn."
