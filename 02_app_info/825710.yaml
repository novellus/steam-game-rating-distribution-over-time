    about_the_game: "The Marder 2 was an experimental German IFV, developed in the\
      \ late 1980s to replace the aging Marder IFV. It featured more armor, a new\
      \ turret and a brand-new Rheinmetall dual-caliber autocannon that could fire\
      \ both 35mm and 50mm rounds. Despite its qualities, the vehicle was never accepted\
      \ in service due to its high cost and because it was no longer needed because\
      \ of the fall of the Soviet Union. A single surviving prototype can be found\
      \ today in the Koblenz military collection.<br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare, the\
      \ Marder 2 is a Tier 8 Armored Fighting Vehicle. With its 44 tons, it\u2019\
      s one of the heaviest and toughest AFVs around. Unlike many other AFVs of its\
      \ Tier, it is not armed with guided missiles, relying instead on its extremely\
      \ powerful 50mm autocannon. It also features special black camouflage."

    review: 'The devs have just announced that they intend to use deliberately unfair
      matchmaking to "allow for more comfortable gameplay" for people who purchase
      "Battle Hardened status" (previously just an economic bonus) for their vehicles
      with premium currency.


      Yes, they actually publicly announced deliberately unbalanced, pay-to-win matchmaking
      and they are trying to sell it as a feature.

      On a more personal note, I am already starting to regret buying the Marder because
      after sinking more than 800 hours and a LOT of money into Armored Warfare, I
      was perma-banned from the forums for pointing out that it is rude to just say
      "no" and lock threads where customers make suggestions.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158


      I think the actual reason for the ban is that "Silent Stalker" the Steam Community
      Manager has a personal vendetta against me for pointing out that his previous
      article about the Korean K2 tank contained factual errors (such as his claim
      that the license-built Rheinmetal gun was designed in Korea.)


      https://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther


      He deleted all the responses to his article on the forum but I saved a screenshot
      which shows me responding to his factual errors in the same


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055


      Update:


      The ban was removed... from Steam by someone working for Valve... but I am now
      banned from the AW Discord after I made the mistake of asking the mod "Soren"
      for help with the Steam ban. Soren is not even pretending to be decent as you
      can see. He even brazenly put "Thanks for the feedback" as the reason for the
      ban.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497


      So yeah, Steam is good but at least part of My.games is staffed by proud morons
      who treat their paying customers like dirt... sad to see a potentially good
      game in such hands.


      Old Review:


      It''s far too expensive IMHO so only buy it on sale. If you get it on sale,
      it''s one of the best and most versatile vehicles in the game.'
