A friend and I who have played disc golf together several times wanted to play some disc golf so we purchased it and attempted to play it. The disc physics are terrible. I could never get the disc to go straight. It would fly way to the side or even behind me. Did not enjoy at all. If you want to play a VR disc golf game I would recommend Rec Room over this and it is free.","timestamp_created":1576614387,"timestamp_updated":1576614387,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ408viiu8Cf7qC5QE="}
