It's very challenging and I'm fine with it. I had moments where I struggled with a few levels but I had eventually passed them. One thing I'm sad and wish they had was a multiple save system. So say if I wanted to do a walk through for my YouTube channel or to show this game off I can't :( unless uninstalling and reinstalling does that. Either way I give this game on my own matter an 8/10. ^^","timestamp_created":1509574295,"timestamp_updated":1509574295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ffovN8CfLKNigE="}
