    about_the_game: 'Slip is a fast paced side scrolling platformer that utilizes
      a two-color swap mechanic to allow the player to evade danger. Slip is not for
      the faint of heart. It has an immense focus on timing and features devilishly
      tricky level design. Utilizing your two colors, absorb damage from incoming
      projectiles of the same color, or be destroyed immediately by the opposite color.
      Additionally, Slip features colored Geometry that you only interact with when
      you share its color. This is perfect when you need a place to stand, but can
      result in instant death if you land on a set of spikes sharing your color. In
      addition to color based obstacles, Slip is also host to numerous Color driven
      props. Sharing the color of a launch-ring will shoot you in the direction it
      faces. Match the color of a gravity well to get sucked in and color swap again
      to have it launch you in which ever direction you are spinning. Lastly, utilize
      the phase shift platforms to shift vertically in the direction of your color.
      <br><br><strong>Game Progression: </strong><br>Slip is split up into 12 levels
      with an overworld connecting them. Game progression is linear with each level
      being unlocked when the level before it is beaten. Each level features a plethora
      of deadly obstacles that result in instant death. However, since the game can
      be quite difficult, there are frequent checkpoints laid throughout each level.
      Lives are NOT limited. You can press on until your thumbs are weary. <br><br>At
      the end of every level there is a mini-boss or boss encounter. During these
      sequences the game switches to an autorun mode where the player can adjust their
      position on screen by moving left or right. Here, positioning can mean the difference
      between life and death.<h2 class="bb_tag">Why we run: The story of Slip.</h2>You
      play as the devilishly cubie protagonist. You''ve always been pretty awesome
      with your ability to swap between 2 colors. You''re a pretty sweet deal. Your
      nemesis Steve, on the other hand, is gross and smooth, nasty and organic. His
      color is that of a sickly peach. Why doesn''t he just swap colors like you?
      Because he can''t. Because he''s Steve. In his early years Steve idolized you.
      He wanted to be you. After a failed attempt to become your sidekick (you don''t
      have sidekicks since you''re not a superhero) Steve began to seclude himself
      from the world. His envy of you grew and turned to hatred and resentment. He
      worked tirelessly in his lab creating all forms of horrible beings. His greatest
      triumph however has just been unleashed upon you. You couldn''t have foreseen
      in your wildest dreams that Steve''s malice would lead to such a monstrosity
      as the color purple. And now, it is upon you.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Key

    short_description: Slip is a fast paced side scrolling platformer featuring a
      two color, swap mechanic. Using your two colors flee from Steve and his wretched
      purple beam through a multitude of obstacles and enemies. Slip combines the
      elegant simplicity of platforming with a polarity mechanic to create an easy
      to learn, but extremely difficult to master...
