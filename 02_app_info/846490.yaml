    review: "Clever spin on traditional tower defense.  Very cute art, gentle ambient\
      \ music, and once you get past the tutorial levels, surprisingly challenging\
      \ and compelling levels.  I've played up through level 13 at this point in the\
      \ Desert realm, and the difficulty curve is pretty well established so far.\
      \  Hoping I can convince some friends to play, as it looks like in later levels\
      \ the Leaderboards could be pretty fun to try to keep top slot -- a lot of nuanced\
      \ strategies to improve your score on any given level.  \n\nMy only complaint\
      \ thus far is that there's a bug where occasionaly I will get the intro screen\
      \ for Level 11 (boss level) even though I'm on a later level.  Not a showstopper,\
      \ just exit and go back into the level and it's fixed, but looking foward to\
      \ an update -- would be sweet to add more traps and tools, too!  \n\n"
