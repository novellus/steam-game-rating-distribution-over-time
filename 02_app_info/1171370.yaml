    short_description: The Supper is a short adventure game about the darkest side
      of the human soul. Ms. Appleton was always a wellspring of kindness, until The
      Voice started talking to her.

    review: Love this game! Great visual style and great story line. Love the style
      and the puzzles aren't bad, The game a lot shorter than I wanted. I wanted to
      keep playing but it was done. I have bought all of Octavi Navarro's games and
      I've loved them all.  Should buy! Won't be let down.
