    review: "Je pense qu'il est important de pr\xE9ciser que les voix propos\xE9es\
      \ dans ce pack sont en anglais contrairement \xE0 la plupart des packs de voix\
      \ propos\xE9s par Steam. Les sons sont de bonne qualit\xE9, il y en a plus de\
      \ 800, ce qui est plus que correct par rapport au prix du pack."
