There's no middle ground; you either solve them immediately or you're looking up a walkthrough. The writing is hilariously bad, especially with all the grammatical errors (or just generally bad translation if you select English). Now top it all off with numerous technical issues and having to redo the same puzzles whenever you get one wrong.\n\nThere's nothing good to be said about this game, so here's a list of cons.\n[list]\n[*]No hints or workarounds if you're stuck\n[*]Half the puzzles reused from the first game\n[*]Must redo the same puzzles over and over\n[*]Horrendous loading times\n[*]Down to 30 FPS with 1080 Ti, not even on ultras\n[*]Blatant grammatical errors all over Russian version\n[*]Bad English translation\n[*]Collision issues everywhere\n[*]No mouselook sensitivity adjustment\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1609447091,"timestamp_updated":1609447091,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s7Wh3fYCfaSavwI="}
