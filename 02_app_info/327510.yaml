      Get wasted, or get wasted trying.\u201D<br><br>When a thermonuclear blitzkrieg\
      \ deprives America of its greatest minds, the very hardiest specimens of humanity\
      \ cling on to life. From the ashes of old America, a new world emerges, and\
      \ an ersatz, post-apocalyptic, stillborn 80\u2019s continues indefinitely, populated\
      \ entirely by the toughest, meanest, and outright dumbest of God\u2019s creations,\
      \ the Wasters.<br><br>Live the life of a Waster, fighting tooth and nail, bullets\
      \ and baseball bats over the most precious of unnatural resources, a liquid\
      \ from beneath the sands that fuels all of un-civilization: Booze. Gain strange\
      \ mutational Hangovers and explore the Coolers, mysterious underground bunkers,\
      \ in search of powerful weapons, impressive armor, and a nice stiff drink to\
      \ top it all off. Who knows, maybe you'll uncover some old world secrets while\
      \ you're at it.<br><br>Or don't, because death comes quick in the Western Wastes,\

    short_description: Get wasted or get wasted trying in WASTED, a roguelike post-apocalyptic
      pub crawler. Fight tooth and nail, bullets and baseball bats in search of Booze,
      gain strange mutational Hangovers, and explore the Coolers in search of powerful
      weapons, armor, and a nice stiff drink to top it all off.
