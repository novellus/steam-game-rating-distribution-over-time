It doesn't save between level, so once you've completed the horrid first level, level 2 starts you on a unicycle without explanation how to play and you die in 5 seconds from falling! Then back to the very begining!\nThe graphics are so much better than how the game plays that it makes me wonder if it's not an asset flip, or worse, if the sprites have not been \"borrowed\" from another game.","timestamp_created":1576895973,"timestamp_updated":1576895973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531499803066253662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46OCUk+8CdPLX5QE="}
