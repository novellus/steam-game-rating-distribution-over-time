You pick one just before the match starts.\n*Each weapon has a secondary fire mode for crowd control (for example shotgun bullets spread more on secondary fire). Unlike primary fire modes, secondary fire modes have a cooldown.\n*There are no health or ammo pickups (ammo is infinite).\n*The game is wave based and at the end of each wave players get to choose a specific perk to unlock (30+ HP, an extra grenade, faster movement, etc).\n*The map is reset at the end of each round and a new one is randomly generated.\n*Maps are made of destructible walls and doors that the enemy can breach in numbers and the player can destroy with grenades, allowing for intense escapes while discouraging camping.\n*Blood stains will stay until the end of the round.\n*Great use of dynamic lighting/shadows and blood effects.\n*Optional nightmare mode turns off all the lights except for your torch.\n*Good amount of challenge.\n\nSuggestions:\n*More varied enemy types and maps (dungeons, abandoned mines, space stations, etc).\n*More detailed environments, character models and gore.\n*More modes/objectives (puzzles to solve, etc).\n*Melee combat.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of fast paced gameplay and isometric shooters, or people who are in it for the gorefest. It's frantic fun.","timestamp_created":1545802617,"timestamp_updated":1545802617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574759721755981445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ioLB9OcCeOG4tgE="}
