    review: 'A beautiful space game with an excellent flight system based on Newtonian
      physiques. Seems difficult at start but once it clicks the flight model is very
      intuitive. A more focused space experience which is truly unique in its genre.
      I am already trading and building my fleets while interacting with the universe
      around me. The backdrop to all this is a hard sci-fi one which feels more realistic
      than a lot of the fantasy settings we see. Reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey
      in many ways. A complete game also which is rather cool in the age of never
      ending early access! I would really like to see more games like this or a sequel!'
