    review: 'This has the potential to be a very nice little game, but the user interface
      needs a little tweaking. Still, well worth the price.


      First of all, I have to unplug my secondary monitor when I start the game. Otherwise
      the screen size and placement will not work. It''s okay to plug in again, though.
      I can even move the game window to the external screen without any problems.
      Adjusting monitor settings back and forth might solve the problem if you have
      only one screen. If I understood the reviews correctly, somebody actually got
      a refund because of this! Some customer support might have been a better solution...


      You NEED TO watch the tutorial videos first. And watch them carefully. There
      is no narration, only example play. And it''s not comprehensive. (I''m not sure
      if I should tell you to use Research Notes to increase the likelihood of finds
      at a dig site, because figuring this out by yourself might improve your experience...)
      But the videos are not linked properly on YouTube. You may not recognize them
      from the search result list, and autoplay does not queue them correctly. Click
      the in-game tutorials link, and surf from the publishers channel to get all
      the content.


      In-game Help icons should be on as a default. They''re not at the moment. Click
      them on when you start, and you will have a slightly easier time getting accustomed
      to things.


      Developers: The audio slider is way too difficult to work! Do something about
      this, please?


      Allowing duplicate samples will help your museum gain prestige sooner. It''s
      really no big thing. There''s limited space in exhibition categories, but you
      can take samples off the collection when you find something better. It would
      be nice to have an in-game record of all the finds through all the game time,
      whether exhibited or not. As there isn''t, I wrote mine on Notepad.


      Much of the game consists of hitting the space bar for Next Turn, while you
      wait for your geologists to get to sites, or for more pickaxes to accumulate.
      This is likely to annoy you in the beginning, but it will be less of a bother
      as the game progresses and you get more to think about.


      There''s lots and lots of tools needed to get to and access sites, but the only
      ones I''ve had shortages of have been maps, visas and pickaxes. It might be
      more interesting if some of the other tools they were more scarce, and if it
      were possible to trade them with the computer opponents. Or sell and buy at
      some free market... I would''ve been willing to pay a bit more for some extra
      functionalities like that.


      As other reviewers have said, the learning experience is probably better if
      you haven''t got a lot of prior knowledge about geology. Still, I consider The
      Geology Game a good investment.'
