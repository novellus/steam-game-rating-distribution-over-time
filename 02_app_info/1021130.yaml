    about_the_game: "You are an ordinary guy who likes to drive a truck. You think\
      \ the trucks are graceful, graceful and insanely beautiful. You are ready to\
      \ polish every nut of your favorite, despite the fact that there are millions\
      \ of them. You are able to pick up cargo from the most unprepared cargo platforms\
      \ using every available millimeter. You don't care how much you get paid for\
      \ it. You do not need to spend effort on this. It is important for you only\
      \ to apply your skill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1) A fully physical model of cargo.\
      \ The load has weight, volume, size, not in the form of numbers in a menu, but\
      \ a real representation in the game world. Load your truck with this in mind,\
      \ because otherwise you will not only risk losing the load, but not getting\
      \ to your destination at all.<br />\r\n2) Realistic physical model of the car.\
      \ Riding on rails is not about us.<br />\r\n3) Repair system. Don't like your\
      \ truck? Are its components and assemblies completely worn out? Is the engine\
      \ smoking, the gearbox is buzzing? Disassemble your truck completely and reassemble\
      \ as you like and as you see fit. Configure the components and assemblies in\
      \ accordance with their ideas about what a multi-ton machine is.<br />\r\n4)\
      \ Purchase of real estate. Tired after a hard day? Relax in your bachelor lair\
      \ or build your dream home. Tired of working? Buy commercial buildings that\
      \ bring you passive income.<br />\r\n5) Driver licensing system. Yes, you can\u2019\
      t just pick up and carry any cargo around the city. You need to prove your skills\
      \ and buy a license for more complex cargo transportation.<br />\r\n6) Complex\
      \ unloading sites. Untrained loading and unloading sites are the realities of\
      \ any person who is engaged in the delivery of goods. Show your skill.<br />\r\
      \n7) The system of changing the day and night. Night is replaced by day, day\
      \ is replaced by night.<br />\r\n8) Weather system. Sunny, cloudy, windy, gray,\
      \ rainy - we do not choose the weather.<br />\r\n9) Damage system. The combination\
      \ of two systems - modularity and dents, give a good damage system. Drive your\
      \ truck carefully - repairs will be very expensive.<br />\r\n10) Traffic system.\
      \ The city lives and lives its own life. This is a large anthill in which everyone\
      \ is busy with his own business. Someone goes to work, someone goes shopping.\
      \ The city will not revolve around you - you either obey its rhythm, or the\
      \ city will send you to the landfill of life."
