That's perfect for making some classic feeling RPG games. However, some of the tiles are nearly ruined due to the new 3 tile tall character sprites. If you use RPG Maker very much you might already see some of the problems this can pose. \n\nFor example, what if you had a 2 tile tall lamp. For 1 tile tall sprites that's all fine and good, as you can make the top tile of the lamp be an overlay, and the bottom be an un-passible tile.\n\nBut this doesn't work with 3 tile tall sprites as now they are tall enough to reach that top, overlay tile of the lamp. This means that you'd need a script to change the overlay settings of the top tile of the lamp on the fly. \n\nAs I've not found a script to do this, the problem renders many of the tile sets almost useless. For the $30 price point seems way too high for something that hardly works, and seems poorly thought out.\n\n\n(Also, I can't find out how to make use of hte side view battle system, so the DLC doesn't quite seem as easy as they make it out to be in the description) \n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, this might just all be me not seeing something super obvious, but I feel it's best in this case to write about my own expierences with the product.","timestamp_created":1522119488,"timestamp_updated":1522119488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557195544242858887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoIbZsuICepnYnAE="}
