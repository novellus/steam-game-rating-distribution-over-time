    review: "Out of the Abyss is a great campaign with a lot of interesting characters\
      \ and monsters. I DMed this campaign and had four and then later five players\
      \ play the campaign.\n\nThis was my first time DMing so take what I say as you\
      \ will, but it was a rather hard campaign to DM (which I later saw many people\
      \ online saying this). The campaign has a decent story, but there is only small\
      \ tidbits that is strewn across the book that interweave the story. For the\
      \ **most** part each chapter is rather separate from the others and how to get\
      \ them all to link together takes a bit of forethought.\n\nFor example all of\
      \ the starting NPCs in the group play roles later on, and this is not clear\
      \ unless you read ahead. In essence what you need to do read each chapter to\
      \ figure out how each tag-along NPC should act and what their motives and uses\
      \ are (for the most part each chapter has a location one NPC wants to go). I\
      \ would read a chapter or two ahead of my players and this causes issues as\
      \ I did not read the entire book ahead of time. I messed up on some of the NPCs.\n\
      \nFrom some of the players perspective they felt kind of railroaded even though\
      \ this campaign is a fairly big sandbox. This could be because I am a new /\
      \ bad DM, but they were asking \"why are we doing this again?\" For many chapters\
      \ they thought the campaign would end as soon as they get to the surface (which\
      \ is actually the halfway point).  The also did not like the survival mechanics\
      \ (getting lost, looking for food, madness, resting causing a con save, etc.).\
      \  Personally as a player I would have loved these mechanics, but my players\
      \ are more role-play heavy and more \"beer and pretzels\". \n\nIf your players\
      \ want a gritty, survival, and always near death game where you wander from\
      \ place to place, it would be a lot of fun!\n\nA few downsides to the campaign\
      \ in general is not enough maps, the reason to kill the BBEG is not personal,\
      \  the player's have false choices (go to the next place over here where it\
      \ is level appropriate, or miss out on a ton of XP and being under equipped),\
      \ and also the players did not like the lack of magical items. \n\nIt is all\
      \ up to personal taste, and I think I would have liked it more as a player than\
      \ some of my friends. Currently we are playing Curse of Strahd as it is kind\
      \ of the opposite (BBEG is up in your face, lots of role-play, seems to have\
      \ more magic items, and more puzzles)."
