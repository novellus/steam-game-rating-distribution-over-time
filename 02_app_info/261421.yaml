    about_the_game: 'The Goatperson DLC adds a new playable class to Desktop Dungeons''
      already large roster of characters. The Goatperson is a throwback to roguelike
      gameplay of yesteryear, answering the oft-asked question &quot;What would Desktop
      Dungeons be like if you had to eat food like regular roguelikes?&quot;, the
      less-oft-asked question &quot;What do Goatpeople eat anyways?&quot; and the
      briefly-asked &quot;Why did we just switch gods?&quot;.<br />

      <br />

      This DLC also contains a new building, the aptly named Goat Glade, which houses
      a useful Item Lottery for players with more gold than sense, as well as a series
      of unique Triple Quests that pit players against three randomly generated dungeons
      in a row (reminiscent of the infamous campaign in the Desktop Dungeons alpha).
      Each Triple Quest reveals new knowledge about the world of Desktop Dungeons.'

    review: 'It''s more of the way to say thanks to the developer for an awesome main
      game, than an actual DLC.

      Desktop Dungeons can easily provide 50-100+ hours of gameplay for a very low
      price, adding few bucks to it seems reasonable.'
