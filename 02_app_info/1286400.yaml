    about_the_game: "Door Kickers: Action Squad is nostalgia and old memories rekindled\
      \ by fresh ideas and inspiration from other cool games we play now. We got hundreds\
      \ of hours of similar gameplay in our childhoods - back in the 80s or 90s -\
      \ and wanted to recreate that feeling for today\u2019s players and even our\
      \ own kids. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo be able to recreate the atmosphere of the\
      \ time, this side-scroller had to be pixel art. But because we are in the years\
      \ 2000 retro graphics with high detail is what we wanted to achieve and we hope\
      \ we did it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt all started with Knockjack - a prototype\
      \ that was showcased to us by Mike of PixelShard; It looked cool  - and old\
      \ school - but had a plumber guy shooting zombies in the face as central character.\
      \ To make it more our own and transform it into a spin-off of Door Kickers we\
      \ brought the old gang of troopers in this version too. It took us a while to\
      \ define the style and characters of the game and this small art book graphically\
      \ documents the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMay it bring you inspiration and\
      \ joy in your own creations!"
