      \ /><br>\u201CGoblin times\u201D is a turn-based strategy game mixed with RPG\
      \ elements. There are five kinds of sources: gold, food, staff, reputation and\
      \ happiness. Players could use these sources to produce units, build constructions,\
      \ develop policies, and pay the price for map mechanism and random incidents.\
      \ The map is in tiles. You could move the leader and their units across the\
      \ tiles and order workers to build constructions in tiles. Every unit is able\
      \ to level up and buy equipment to strengthen themselves.<br>In the current\
      \ version, there are 8 different forces for players to choose. They are able\
      \ to control a leader who is on behalf of certain force to explore, expand,\
      \ exploit and exterminate.<br>Of course players could also choose their own\
      \ winning strategies by highest reputation, possess rare resources, or just\
      \ up take down their opponents by force. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191870/extras/vampire1.jpg?t=1599788534\"\

      m the author, and I have something to say: I\u2019m a huge movie fan and this\
      \ game is also inspired by two classic films: \u201CModern Times\u201D and \u201C\
      Chicago\u201D. These two masterpieces portray the ugly side of capitalism thoroughly\
      \ with a comic and satiric style, and still remain entertaining at the same\
      \ time. As a big advocate of socialism, I always have a special place in my\
      \ heart for this kind of films. <br>On the other hand, as a gamer who is incredibly\
      \ into 4X games such as \u201CSid Meier's Civilization\u201D, I always dreamt\
      \ of making a game of the same genre for my own entertainment. And as time went\
      \ by, the day finally came. As I encountered a game called \u201CGremlins inc\u201D\
      \ which was right up my ally and served as a huge inspiration to me. That\u2019\
      s when I really took action and started to design and develop a strategy game\
      \ with a sense of black humor.<br>The game right now is still in development\
      \ cause it\u2019s a two-man project and we\u2019ve got so much to learn and\
      \ explore. If you have any kind of suggestion, please feel more than welcome\
      \ to leave a message to us (*^\u25BD^*)."
