    review: 'Another short charmer from the Deity Driving dev; the same good vibe
      of aesthetic absurdity in the environments and comedic sincerity from the characters,
      now with a mix of 3D environments and... whatever you call first-person 2D exploration.


      When people say "I want shorter games with worse graphics", this is what I''m
      hoping for more of (although let''s say "simpler graphics", for anyone who conflates
      ''graphics'' with ''visuals''.)'
