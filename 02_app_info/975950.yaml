    review: "I usually don't write any reviews at all whatsoever, but I'm unable to\
      \ understand why the majority reviewed this positive.\nI feel like this game\
      \ needed much more polishing before it released, especially the combat. \nI\
      \ know that this is a indie game and all but I feel like people are way too\
      \ forgiving for what in the end feels like a very lazy made game. \n\nPlatform\
      \ Gameplay: \nOverall feels nice, nothing in this is new. You got your standard\
      \ double jump and dash and that's pretty much it \nand it could be fun if it\
      \ wasn't for the very uninspiring locations and lack of challenge.\n\nPuzzles:\
      \ \nBraindead. \n\nCombat: \nCombat feels really chunky and unsatisfying, there\
      \ are only 2 combos in total and the light attack combo is pretty much\nuseless\
      \ since the heavy one deals with the enemies quicker. Later on you unlock 2\
      \ skills which add no depth to the combat at all. There are 5 enemy types in\
      \ total plus one boss that you have to fight 4 times. The enemy types are all\
      \ pretty early revealed \nin the game so combat pretty much feels like a chore\
      \ you don't wanna do. This all wouldn't be to much of a problem if the game\
      \ wasn't that combat heavy, but it is, and it's fucking boring.\n\nStory: \n\
      Allright I guess? The cutscenes don't have any other animations then Garland\
      \ just walking around and a camera showing you\nthe location, I think Garland\
      \ the protagonist is the only one who has mouth animations when he talks but\
      \ the Witch (Main Antagonist) doesn't for some reason. Quick sidenote: I think\
      \ there are only 3 voice actors in this game but for some reason during the\
      \ bossfights with the witch they only managed to have her record ONE WORD for\
      \ all of her attacks, which was sooooo fucking annoying to listen to, it's like\
      \ every 20 seconds a fucking HYAAAH. Is there literally no other sound she can\
      \ make or say, do they have to pay the voice actors millions of dollars for\
      \ one word?\n\nVisual/Graphics: \nIt's quit nice... but it get's underwhelming\
      \ quit quick cause the most colors you are gonna see is white, red and brown/grey\
      \ tones. Although the vinyard was a nice change but idk it didn't really change\
      \ much. \n\nOverall if you have a big love for platforming games you can get\
      \ that game when it's on sale for 10 or 5 bucks or whatever\ncause 20 is way\
      \ to much for a 5 to 7 hour long game with a result that is gonna leave you\
      \ unsatisfied. Quit dissapointing but who knows maybe they do better games or\
      \ a better sequel if this blows off."
