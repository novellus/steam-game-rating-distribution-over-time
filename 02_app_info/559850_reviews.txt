It adds to the story from the first one while adding a lot of other elements to keep the reader entertained. With the concept of time at your grasp, the possibilities seem endless. \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- Some interactions between characters are nice. I especially the interactions Kenji has with Rose.\n- The character portraits are improved.\n- The art and background music is nice. Better than the first game? Not sure, but it is more consistent in comparison to the first game where some CGs had different artstyles. The egyptian sounding music in the title screen is nice.\n- I like most of the characters and how they were handled here. Tessa is a little rude, but is entertaining in a couple of scenes. Rose, Michelle, and Tensai are done fine as well. \n- The story is entertaining and gives a lot of explanations on things to give you a good understanding as to what is going on and why it is happening.\n- More choices. Yay!\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Wish Kyo acted more serious since her talking about breasts during their missions happened a lot. It was getting to the point where I almost got annoyed with it like Tessa was. Speaking of which, I was hoping she and Kyo had better interactions since they seem to butt heads. Instead, it mostly consisted of Kyo ignoring her, Tessa insulting her, and then [spoiler]Tessa has one line near the end where she apologizes for being rude to her.[/spoiler]\n- Wish there were more scenes that referenced things in the first game. Also, I wish there are handled better than just to throw it in here and ask the reader, \"Hey! Remember this from the first game?\" Not to say there was anything wrong with them. It's just like there were only there for that sole reason. Not for a causal interaction between characters that the reader could remember a character mentioning a particular trait, but just asking the reader if they remembered a certain character trait. \n- I get that the devs want to get character interactions quickly to focus on the story, but there has to be a better way than a character telling us their life story in one scene.\n- Why doesn't Kenji have a character model? Would have been nice for a scene near the end of the story where [spoiler]they state Kenji is now buff, but we never get to see his buff, steroid body.[/spoiler]\n- Even though I just enjoy seeing them, it would've been nice to see Kenji's parents more. We only see them for one scene and only mentions throughout the VN.\n- Kenji should've had some time talking about how he feels like he is dead weight instead of [spoiler]Rose giving him a task to do, and him telling this to Tessa in her romance ending[/spoiler]\n- There were a lot of unanswered questions. Questions that probably won't get answered anytime soon.\n\n[h1]Nitpicks[/h1]\n- Why isn't Mizuki in the title page or in the store page trailer? What happened with Mizuki?\n- One scene with Tessa shows Tensai's name in the text box instead of hers.\n- I would like if there was a previous page button in the Gallery section. Additionally, can we view the different iterations of a CG? For example, one of Rose's CG has two different backgrounds when it shows up in the story. However, unless I'm missing something, I can only view the first one. I tried pressing buttons, but nothing happened.\n- Wish some scenes were structured differently. Many went like \"talking, and then BOOM! Fanservice CG.\"\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nTime Tenshi is a good sequel. The art and background are nice to look at. Not to mention that it improves on a lot of issues I had from the first one. However, the excessive fanservice and breast expansion will turn some people away from this. If you liked the first one, then I definitely recommend it. If you want to read through a VN with time travel and fanservice, then this VN is the right one for you. Definitely recommend getting it on sale. Thanks for reading my review and have a good day, everyone.","timestamp_created":1602004157,"timestamp_updated":1602049993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kt3ngPUCeIWgpgI="}
