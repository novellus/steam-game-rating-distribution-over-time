I liked the story, which was kinda funny at times. Some of the puzzles were quite difficult and illogical, but I liked the challenge. And, even though I'm not a religious person at all, the game can teach you a thing or two about Jesus. Great job! Till next time, don't forget to point & click!","timestamp_created":1595671243,"timestamp_updated":1595671243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518820643424987793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j93awvMCcPi3lwI="}
