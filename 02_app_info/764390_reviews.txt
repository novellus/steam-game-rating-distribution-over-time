I'm currently playing Puzzle Mode, in which you have one or more warriors who have to move across an obstacle-laden map, with a goal of reaching their same-colored square in an optimal number of moves. Every warrior on the map turns / moves the same way when you press a key, which forces you to think spatially to get them all to their allotted spaces without wasting moves or getting stuck and having to re-start the level, and it can be pretty mind-bending when there are multiple warriors on the map. Finishing a level unlocks the next no matter how many moves it takes you (good for the impatient), but I found it more fun to replay levels until I completed them in the minimal number of moves.\n\nIt's casual yet challenging, and can be played even if you only have a couple of free minutes. Fairly priced at $1.99.","timestamp_created":1535855779,"timestamp_updated":1535855779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y+uIzOUCfeTqqQE="}
