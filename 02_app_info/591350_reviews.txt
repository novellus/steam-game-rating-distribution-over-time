It's not a game I would normally buy, but I do enjoy mazes and even if it sucked it was only a buck fifty.  Depending on how fast you can complete the mazes you can finish all 26  within an hour or two, so take that into consideration.  The mazes do get larger and harder the further you go, but so far I've done 23 of them without much trouble.  The biggest cons to me are the fact you have to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character and the music is loud and annoying.  I wish you could set the options to allow you to use the WASD keys or your mouse to move and to have volume control for the music.  I would recommend buying it on sale, but if you really enjoy mazes this game could be for you.","timestamp_created":1604506098,"timestamp_updated":1604506098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlYOByvUCeqqjrAI="}
