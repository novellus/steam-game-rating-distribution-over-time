    review: I played the game for more than an hour. Overall the game is interesting
      to play. If you can develop the full version with the features you mentioned,
      it's going to be a killer. Melee should have been there in this build as an
      alternate option of offence. But still it's ok as I managed to use bullets efficiently
      and run away to objectives. Routes are tricky to find yet I liked that too.
      Also I agree with IZER above for every point mentioned. Overall I recommend
      this game to try on and is worth your money.
