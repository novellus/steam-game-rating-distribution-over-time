    about_the_game: DoVille is a VR destination with places to visit and things to
      try. This first chapter &quot;Juniper Beach&quot; has a mini-mystery at it's
      heart, but we encourage you to try all the VR rides and give us feedback during
      early access so we can build more for you.<br><br>You should know that we're
      testing this game for young and the elders. Elders don't get enough content,
      and we've got a bit of a &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; (an elder's show) mixed
      with the 1970s vibe going so they can really get into it. <br><br>From parasailing
      to roller-coasting, from chatting to locales to having a nice sit on a VR beach
      while it might be snowing outside in real life, DoVille, we hope, has a little
      for everyone.<br><br>Anything we try we're also building into a portable version
      we'll fire out to elders, so we really hope it's a hit, and only VR players
      in Early Access on Steam can help us do that.<h2 class="bb_tag">DoVille </h2><br>In
      the land of DoVille and all through the world,<br>The Do's were amassing and
      having a thrill.<br>VR Rides to engage and and crime motives to prove,<br>It's
      low poly VR with high stakes as its groove.<br><br>Early Access here is the

      really you, and we're we and that is quite all.<br><br>_______________________________________________________<br><br>DoVille's
      a world with a bunch of activities and some mysteries all running in VR.  We're
      a bunch of devs (and supporters) who wanted to build a VR game that was good
      for people  - older adults in particular (more on that), but it had to be fun
      for you and us on Steam here, or it wouldn't be any fun for us to work on, and
      that's important. <br><br>So we had a thought - build a VR game, that is kind
      of open ended - a big world that we can add to whenever we want with a clean,
      crisp look.<br><br>You should use a revolving chair for this game (that's where
      the good for you part comes in). It helps your brain build an inner picture
      of what you're seeing, and we are confident that it can actually improve your
      short-term memory. We're designing the tests to prove that.
