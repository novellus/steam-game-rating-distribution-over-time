    review: A cheap and easy-to-learn game good for relaxing for 30 mins to an hour
      after work. The soundtrack is my absolute favorite part of it, and I found myself
      purchasing the soundtrack shortly after the game. There have been several updates
      to the game since I bought it, and the developer seems really approachable in
      case there is a problem or you have questions regarding the game.
