    review: "Thriller Pack 2 contains Cabin Stay and The Pact. I have yet to experience\
      \ Cabin Stay. Below is a review for The Pact, which is my first experience with\
      \ Amaze VR's premium content. I'll work on adding a review of Cabin Stay at\
      \ a later time.\n\nThe Pact is an interactive VR film for Amaze VR, starring\
      \ Lorynn York (Rachel) and Seri DeYoung (Emily). This is a thriller with supernatural\
      \ elements, in which the viewer takes on the point of view (POV) of a male (I\
      \ think?) friend who is out with Rachel and Emily. The Pact doesn't spend much\
      \ time getting things moving before you and your friends are abducted by a creepy,\
      \ mask-wearing, knife-wielding, person. Maybe there's more to the plot setup,\
      \ but it felt rushed into the action, so the setup didn't stick with me. \n\
      Not divulging further details of the plot, as the film moves forward there are\
      \ multiple moments in which you can choose what you or others will do next.\
      \ These choose-your-own-next-step elements don't have any lasting impact on\
      \ the plot, but they do support immersion as they change how things move forward.\
      \ That said, don't try to 'game' the experience with the best choice. Make the\
      \ choice you want to make to get the best version of the film you want to see\
      \ (If you're worried about missing content, there's a 'skip 15 seconds ahead'\
      \ and 'skip to next branching choice' feature that you can use on repeated viewings).\
      \ At the end of the film, the viewer does get some genuine control over where\
      \ the story goes. The final choice you make will determine the ending of the\
      \ story. I went through all four endings, and each play through, with different\
      \ choices each time, uses about fifteen to twenty minutes of the thirty-eight\
      \ minute runtime listed for the film. So, that's how things work in terms of\
      \ mechanics. Let's move on to content.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Film\
      \ Quality[/td]\n        [td]Smooth framerate, hi-res live action VR. The tracking\
      \ shots where your character is moving are slick. I've seen comments elsewhere\
      \ complaining about scaling--people look smaller than they would in real life.\
      \ It's true. But this is also the best quality live action VR I've seen so far,\
      \ and I like the FOV it offers. Standard film and TV are generally too large\
      \ in scaling to be realistic, anyway--as if we're all right up in people's faces\
      \ when we interact with them.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Acting[/td]\n\
      \        [td]Lorynn and Seri are the primary actresses here. Each have a history\
      \ in various shorts, TV movies, and series. No lead roles in anything major\
      \ that I recognize. That said, their acting is solid, they are attractive people,\
      \ and they only add value to the film. DeYoung is given one line that is awkward\
      \ and redundant. Other than that, the writer didn't disadvantage them with weak\
      \ dialogue. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Storytelling[/td]\n    \
      \    [td]The film could use some more dialogue overall, as the plot in general\
      \ feels very light. As mentioned earlier, things get moving quick and it feels\
      \ more like you're getting a VR 'experience' that doesn't neccessarily equate\
      \ to getting a story. You get little pieces of story that allow for creepiness\
      \ as things move along, but it's light compared to a standard non-VR film. More\
      \ exposition, whether introducing the characters or focusing on plot, somewhere\
      \ in the beginning would have made it easier to connect with the experience.\
      \ The tension just isn't what it could be without that. I believe it does pass\
      \ the Bechdel test.\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Language[/td]\n\
      \        [td]R-rated due to a few F-bombs in one scene. Minor. As someone who\
      \ likes some dark horror, it's nice to know the VR filmmakers aren't going for\
      \ a PG-13 tone.\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Violence[/td]\n   \
      \     [td]For my fellow horror fans and gorehounds, that is where the tone falls\
      \ short. If there was a rating from the MPAA between PG and PG-13, that's where\
      \ the violence would be. One scene has, literally, a tiny bit of gore. But,\
      \ hey, some is better than none!\nI have to say, the violence that is here feels\
      \ pretty visceral. I'm really impressed how well it works in POV. With very\
      \ low expectations for gore, my only real disappointment is with the climax.\
      \ It could have used some blood effects. Who knows, if they did try to add some\
      \ blood, maybe it would have been CG. While CGI blood can look effective, when\
      \ it's bad I tend to wish it wasn't there at all. So, maybe we dodged a bullet\
      \ in the finale.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]My advice for the best experience\
      \ the first time around[/b]: I know I said to make whatever choices you want\
      \ to make, but I'm going to add a couple suggestions. \n[b]Suggestion one[/b],\
      \ don't \"forget Rachel.\" When that comes up as an option, do not choose it.\
      \ It's cooler and creepier if you don't \"forget Rachel.\"\n[b]Suggestion two[/b],\
      \ the last interactive scene will offer you four choices. Don't be timid with\
      \ your choice, but don't over do it, either. If you do, you get the most boring\
      \ endings. So, really, you should be picking from only two of the four options\
      \ at the end.\n\nOverall, The Pact is pretty cool for a VR film experience and\
      \ the unfamiliar actresses do a solid job. I hope to see more of these offerings\
      \ with better exposition and some intense stuff for the gorehounds. Not particularly\
      \ scary for myself, but I think this is due to the limited exposition. I found\
      \ myself more connected to the characters through the sheer familiarity that\
      \ came with a third and fourth playthrough. However, at that point it's all\
      \ too familiar for jump scares and tension to be effective. Cabin Stay has a\
      \ much longer runtime for content, hopefully that will deliver an experience\
      \ that's easier to connect to."
