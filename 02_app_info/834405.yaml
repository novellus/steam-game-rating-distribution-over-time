    review: 'I like this a lot. As with all of the High Iron add ons that I have bought,
      they do exactly as claimed and in many cases such as this offer real enrichment
      and enjoyment of the route. I just added the AP weather pack to TS as well and
      it makes the bad weather scenarios in this very buttock clenching and enthralling.
      The train 18 scenarios being my faves, mountains, snow and low visibility combine
      to create, an on your toes two hours of driving.

      This is a fine grouping of scenarios and you should buy it with confidence.'
