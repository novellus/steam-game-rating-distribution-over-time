    review: '[h1]Tooooooooo many bugs...[/h1]

      such as a forever unchangeable red signal or forever hanging "please wait a
      while" after a control point. Saving the game somehow crashes scenario... So
      you play a long time and suddenly run into these stupid bugs and you have to
      play the mission over again from start. In addition it has poor optimization.
      Buy it only if you have a lot of free time and you really love trains.'
