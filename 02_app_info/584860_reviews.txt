I think it to be made with something like RPGMaker, but unlike most of those, which appear 16-bit, this appears more... 8-bit? Anyway, the graphics are a throwback to early games. Some of the gameplay is that way, too. A lot of collecting items for money and prestige.\n\nAnyway, the game starts with Brown (you, renamable) having a date with Pink, when Red and his gang show up, and Red... literally kicks you to another island... And now to get your beloved back, you are going to learn how to surf! Seems like a good way (not least because you probably need to get a bit buff to surf).\n\nIt is a fun little thing. And for the price, well-worth it.","timestamp_created":1507849626,"timestamp_updated":1507849626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510971784591674805","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmey1id8CcuaIiAE="}
