      Game of Ur</strong> is an ancient board game where players try to race all of

      combination of luck and strategy made this game one of the most popular board
      games in the world 3000 years ago, and it would form the basis for other token
      racing games like Backgammon that are still being played by millions today.<br><br>Play
