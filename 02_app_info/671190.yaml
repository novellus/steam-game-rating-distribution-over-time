      Pro Motion NG, continues to add and improve upon an already proven and powerful
      tool-set, enabling pixel artists of all skill levels to bring their imaginations

      the layer features to sketch out your design.. quickly and easily perfecting
      the desired sizes, shapes and placement of all key elements - then use the large
      array of drawing, blending, dithering, and shading features to refine your objects
      and add detail.<br><br>Use the rich array of color management tools to finalize
      your overall color scheme and arrange your indexed color palette.<br><br>Once
      your mock-up has allowed you to reach the desired aesthetic and designs, branch
      out to specific project files to begin working on the individual assets, animations,
      and tile-sets. Change layer opacity or blending mode for special effects. You
      can even simulate specific console effect modes like the transparency effects
      seen in Super Nintendo games. <br><br>Create a master project which displays
      your other projects as separate layers, so you can always see how the most recent
      and polished versions of all your assets work together to form a finished game
      screen.<br><br>Use the large array of features such as onion-skinning, animated
      brushes, and time-line editing to animate all the characters, effects and objects

    review: Great Software, does everything I need and was a good deal at 35 that
      I paid for it. Was a little overwhelming at first but I don't use anything else
      and understand all the features. Aesprite is more popular but it was very basic
      and I didn't like the pixel art in the UI itself and eventually you'll want
      something less basic. just skip the others and buy this. If you're looking to
      get into to pixel art for whatever reason get PRO Motion NG.
