This is not the case with this game - it has an environment of mediocre 3D landscapes, repetitive puzzles and an awful auto-save system.  Instead of saving after you have completed a puzzle, it saves at the start of that puzzle, so that if you have to reload or restart the game at all, you have to solve that puzzle again before you can continue.  Having solved the same puzzle three times, I gave up and uninstalled the game.  I fear that trying to compete it would prove to be an endless journey!","timestamp_created":1598350762,"timestamp_updated":1598350762,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51754385232925415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgaTIkvQCe5/TnQI="}
