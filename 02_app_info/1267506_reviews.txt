Also the bell does need changed to an E-Bell sound\nControl stand gauges are not correct, in the real life counterparts they are not digital gauges\nYou can see through the nose camera, almost like its a ghost\nTrain and Independent braking need tweaked, they are very weak in game; The brakes in real life are very responsive\nStrobe lights on top of the GP33 need to flash, they are not supposed to be constantly lit\n\nIf you are looking to get this just for the look and coolness, go ahead buy it\nIf you are expecting high accuracy, I would not pick it up in its current state, but I would if it is updated\n\nOverall it's cool seeing these finally make it to train sim, but they need fixed to be close to 100% accurate. \nThis rating is based on my opinion, which the opinion being from a real NS Conductor in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1599963435,"timestamp_updated":1599963435,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642884731292724609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/5HQwvQCfoa8oQI="}
