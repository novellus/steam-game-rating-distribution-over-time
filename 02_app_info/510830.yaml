    review: 'I bought this game because I saw George Allan''s name on it - for me,
      I knew his name from Venus the Flytrap and his PD Game CHROME from the Amiga
      days.

      It''s a simple platformer; you can move and jump, each room has 5 keys to retrieve
      before going through the exit to the next room.

      The entire layout is set in one level across multiple rooms that loop back and
      fourth through and past each other in a neat, clever little way.

      My first time round to complete took about 2hrs, 16mins with 156 deaths. the
      2nd was 1hr 7mins with 107 deaths. Once you complete it the first time, there
      will be a nagging sensation to come back and do it again - not necessarily to
      break your record but {no spoilers} for something that happens near the end
      which will bring you back at least once.


      in saying that, I still need to go around a third time.... Thanks George.


      I think the price tag is easily worth paying - it especially has a nostalgic
      touch to it - not just because of the 80s enemies but something about it feels
      like I should have this on a 3.5" Floppy, attached an Amiga Power Magazine.'
