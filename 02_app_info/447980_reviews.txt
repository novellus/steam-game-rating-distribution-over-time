Simply a labor of love. Single player is great fun, but the game comes alive in the local multiplayer. The many styles of play offered through each character is fantastic especially once you realize each one has its own depth(some more than others haha). Lots of room for expression and nuance.\n\nIt is very competitive party game so not for all crowds. Also a controller is highly recommended","timestamp_created":1609709447,"timestamp_updated":1609709447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49ZyK5fYCfueZwAI="}
