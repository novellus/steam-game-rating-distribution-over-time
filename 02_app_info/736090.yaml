      away in a dusty basement with a computer for 10 months, I was given the task
      of coming up with a horrifying and yet beautiful soundtrack for a game project.
      It was about a strange town, with morbid inhabitants and a horrible curse. With
      nothing but a few images to go by, this is what I created. 41 instrumental tracks
      (1 hour 50 minutes) of ugly/beautiful/surreal soundscapes and melodies. Perhaps
      something to take with you on a long ride through a quiet place. For fans of
      film scores and strange haunting ambience. I would love to know what you think
      of it. All contributions go towards future artistic/musical projects of mine.

    review: 'Soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka quality.

      each melody is remembered and stays with you for a long time.

      Very cool job.

      With love from Russia'
