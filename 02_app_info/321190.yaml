    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>A brand new super hero epic that will
      electrify your soul!!</strong></h2>Yuuki Yamato has modeled his young life after
      the super heroes he loves.  When his best friend Haruna is teased by bullies,
      he always tries to defend her -- but his life is not a comic book, and things
      never work out as planned.<br><br>One day, after yet another failure, Haruna
      tells Yamato that she is moving away.  She asks him to come and see her off,
      but Yamato -- his pride still wounded -- cannot find the courage to face her.  When
      Yamato is feeling his lowest, an old man appears before him. He is known as
      the Memory Collector, and he will grant one wish in exchange for a memory. Yamato
      makes his wish: to become Dengeki Stryker,  his favorite comic book hero.<br><br>Years
      later, an army of cyborgs from the Balbora Empire appear in the city where Haruna
      now lives. With the police and the army powerless against the Empire''s  mechanical
      might, it falls to a single hero to stop them -- a hero who looks remarkably
      like Dengeki Stryker!<br><br>--------<br><br>- 30 ~ 50 hours of gameplay time<br>-
      Animated cut scenes by acclaimed animation studio Silver Link and directed by
      Watanabe Shinichi<br>- Theme song by JAM Project - Masaaki Endoh<br><br><i>*This
      is the All Ages version. All explicit adult content has been removed; however,
      it does contain violence, coarse language, suggestive themes, and partial nudity.</i>'

      \ Stryker is a visual novel that is packed to the brim with great visuals, awesome\
      \ audio and an engaging storyline. It is also much longer than most visual novels\
      \ and the additional routes boosts the replay value dramatically. If you are\
