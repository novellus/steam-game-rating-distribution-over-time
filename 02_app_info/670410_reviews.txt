Why are there keys for save and load state? Why is load and save tied to my back shoulder buttons, so when I press them to see what they do, I set a state at the beginning of the game. Then I get to accidentally load the state when I try to alt f4 the game, because you bound LOAD STATE TO F4. Take your fucking dev tools out of the game, don't bind them to keys people press on a daily basis, and for the love of god don't bind them to a controller.\n\nWhy can I cancel my attack animation, with my own attack animation? Why, when I crouch to hit a crawling enemy, do you cancel your attack animation? You want me to crouch to hit them, but if I try and walk into a crouch state, you cancel all my attack animations until I have come to a complete stop? This would be completely fine if you didn't give me a gimped as sword, made of water, which has 2 different size/lengthed swings depending on if I jump/crouch or stand. Neither of them being long enough to compensate for the fact that your sub weapons, besides the shuriken, go not far enough, or too far.","timestamp_created":1585006093,"timestamp_updated":1585006093,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557522118091583252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rLTuhPECfIy/+gE="}
