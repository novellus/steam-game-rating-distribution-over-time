EXZEAL offers such a great unique style of shmups with good and quick paced gameplay, with a cool selection of 4 ships offering different shooting mechanics for some unique playstyles. \nAs well as the soundtrack is super catchy, I kept replaying the game many times because of how great it flows with the game.\n\nHonestly EXZEAL is super underrated and anyone who loves shmups of any style, YOU HAVE to try this game out, 10/10","timestamp_created":1604512895,"timestamp_updated":1604512895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gfqayvUCfPGlrAI="}
