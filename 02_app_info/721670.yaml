    about_the_game: "Conquer as much territory as you can with your hero and watch\
      \ for the opponents or you\u2019ll be destroyed. The opponents are evil and\
      \ all they think about is destroying you by touching your path and expanding\
      \ their territory by conquering larger space. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf someone\
      \ crosses your path before you fully enclose an area, you'll die. If you cross\
      \ your own path, you'll die. If you hit a wall, you'll die. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nYou just need to swipe in different directions with arrow keys to move, and\
      \ to claim a territory you just need to close the area. The game continues until\
      \ you own the whole territory. To steal area from your opponents, you need to\
      \ run through their territory and close as much area as possible. But, you should\
      \ be very careful, as you just have One life and you\u2019ll lose it as soon\
      \ as someone hits your tail. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSteal their entire territories\
      \ and conquer the largest space. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures at a Glance:<br\
      \ />\r\n\u2022\tEasy to learn, hard to master<br />\r\n\u2022\tSmooth gameplay<br\
      \ />\r\n\u2022\tWonderful graphics with cool sound effects<br />\r\n\u2022\t\
      Collect gems<br />\r\n\u2022\tConquer the largest territory with your hero<br\
      \ />\r\n\u2022\tSet different heroes for your profile <br />\r\n\u2022\tFun\
      \ for all ages<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConquering territories is really easy as you\
      \ just need to close an area. But the hard part is to keep it from being stolen\
      \ and destroy the opponents by touching their path before being hit and destroyed\
      \ by them. So, sometimes you need to decide fast, and sometimes you just need\
      \ to wait for the perfect moment to increase your acquired territory and destroy\
      \ the opponent. The more opponent you destroy, the more gems you\u2019ll get\
      \ to collect."
