    review: 'EDIT: I don''t want to change my review to negative, as I did genuinely
      enjoy the game.  Up to a point it was progressing nicely.  I did get stuck at
      one point and was unable to progress.   I think it may have been the final boss,
      perhaps but I am not sure.  Basically, at a certain level, there were just too
      many enemies to fight, and I ran out of ammunition.  So, not a great ending,
      but fun while it lasted...


      ORIGINAL REVIEW:

      For the price this is a fun little game!  If you enjoy corridor type shooter
      games, then this one will suit you.  There is even a little story about resistance
      to some kind of cyber A.I. mastermind.  I''m enjoying this thoroughly.'
