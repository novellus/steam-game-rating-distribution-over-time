    review: "This route is great.  I live in Hanover and am intimate with the route,\
      \ especially between Porters and Gettysburg.  the accuracy is amazing. I wanted\
      \ to jump out and visit Tommy Gilbert's and then have a Jolly Scott at the Appalachian\
      \ Brewery. \n Very well done for sure."
