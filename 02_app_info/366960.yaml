    review: "Ok lets start.. you wil not like this game if you are under 25 years\
      \ old. Cause this is old school fps with old graphics and controls. Its a finding\
      \ the way kind of game where you need to find a key, lock up next room etc etc.\
      \ Its not great but there is tons of shitty games that makes this game to golden.\
      \ But its f2p and if you want to have a little childhoodnostalgia, then try\
      \ it out. Do you remeber games titles like \"Zero Tolerans\"? That was the shit\
      \ back then, if i played this in 1995 i would have loved this game. \n\nPros:\n\
      Nostalgia\nThe sound....attackasdfhkasfhasl from the green dude is super!\n\
      Its better then GASP\n\nCons:\nBad rewiews from younger kids that dont have\
      \ any clue about what they are talking about. \nAnd the game isnt that great."
