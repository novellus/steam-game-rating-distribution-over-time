UPDATE! The really bad parts have been changed back by the devs as they realized they made a mistake implementing those changes. I have marked (()) with old outdated information.\n\nLet's start with the worst part..\n\n((They removed the ability to convert territories UNLESS you're in the muslim religious group and propagate religion. Its incredibly dull as that means 1 world faith is pretty much just an Islamic thing and not a Hindu-Christian-Whatever thing unless you use gamey methods.))\n\nNEW INFO: Territories can be converted it just costs more and takes more time than cored states.\n\nIts mostly centered around India, which doesn't usually play a big role in EU4 if you play outside of it, since nations WITHIN the subcontinent rarely if ever influence events outside of it from my experiences.\n\nThe 'bonuses' for chartering trade companies and investing in them are surprisingly lackluster and unless you have 10+ of them you don't really get a major bonus that'll give you power over your rivals.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nTRADE\n\nNatural harbors and inland centers of trade are now modifiable with 3 tiers. For European powers this means its quite possible to dominate trade in say; the English Channel without having to control both the netherlands and England. You can efficiently deal with one or the other.\n\nThis is also true for Argentina and the Caribbean in the new world and India ofc in Asia. North America and Australia/New Zealand hasn't gotten any buff and thus they're nerfed trade wise in my opinion in the sense that you need to control a lot more provinces to control the trade.\n\nPOLICIES\n\nPolicies have been upgraded and is now easier for new players to utilize as the first 1 in each category is FREE. There's also government reforms to make more free down the line which is great. The new  policies has seen some rework but nothing noteworthy.\n\nBUFFED IDEAGROUPS AND NERFED ONES.\n\nExploration ideas have been buffed a lot especially for early and late game. Colonists can now be used to dev up your provinces for when there's nothing else to colonize or you can't colonize yet which makes the ideagroup even better than before. Expansion ideas have also been buffed slightly because of this too, and the policy you get for having both has been buffed aswell. Before you would recieve +20 colonists and now you get +20 colonists and -50% native uprising chance.\n\n((Religious ideas have been nerfed a lot because missionaries have very little to do when territories can't be converted. Humanism is undoubtedly the superior choice for any great empire.)) UPDATE: Religious ideas are now good again!\n\nGOVERNMENT REFORM.\n\nA much needed revamp but it doesn't feel fleshed out enough in that the options are quite few, especially for theocracies. Republics are buffed in this, with the most 'tiers' to go down. Hopefully they'll work on adding more choices for all government types in the future as having just 2 choices kinda suck. (UPDATE) They have fleshed it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe price they're asking is high, its worth about half of that unless you're a huge fan and you love to play India. Its not a needed DLC, but it isn't completely useless either. (Like Mare Nostrum). If you are new to EU4 then get COMMON SENSE and ART OF WAR long before you even consider putting money into this one.\n\n(FYI) I consider what this newest patch and this DLC brought together rather than apart, as the price according to paradox is reflected in the amount of workhours put into both the free update and the DLC, It seems thus fair to me to judge it together.","timestamp_created":1536249623,"timestamp_updated":1605321753,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":247,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.761199653148651123","comment_count":13,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4msCo4vUCfIiSqgE="}
