Try out the game today. This isn't an Early Access. This is an Early Alpha. Controls are really bad, so for example, swimming is very curious. The Char swimms wherever he want, I can not pop up so swimming is really a gambling, to start a dialogue I have to click on a NPC. Really? Why should not use \"E\" for interaction. Left mouse for ? Not here. Ok the game only cost 7 Euros but thats to much for a game in this status. Thats an refund.\n\nBut every game become a second chance. We see us in a few months and will see how it goes on with the game.","timestamp_created":1609695332,"timestamp_updated":1609735697,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609699644,"developer_response":"The game does not support controller fully, yet. Hence why it was stated 'partially supported'. However, as a consequence of your input I have removed mention of controller support. \n\nYou can configure the Interaction keybinding under the menu settings to your liking. Swimming is not yet optimized. Sorry to hear that you were not satisfied, have a great day."}],"cursor":"AoJ4pq7u5fYCerORwAI="}
