    about_the_game: 'Inspired by William Shakespeare''s poem <i>All The World''s A
      Stage</i> comes the VR game: <i>The Seven Stages</i>.  As in the poem, each
      man or woman is defined by their ability to change.  In order to change or grow,
      the player must escape a room that represents a stage in their life.  Early
      puzzles like one''s young life are rather elementary, while later puzzles, growing
      into adulthood and beyond can become unmanageable.  <i>The Seven Stages</i>
      is both a game and an emotional experience.  Shakespeare has suggested that
      a person''s ability to change is one of their greatest strengths.  Can you solve
      the puzzles of your life?<br><br><i>The Seven Stages</i> is a challenging escape
      the room game that is for hardcore puzzle solvers.  I encourage the player to
      think of these puzzles with out VR headset on.'

    review: 'Tried the game for 30 min, realized its not very good. Same irritating
      song keeps playing over and over, some puzzles don''t work or have bugs. Got
      tired of it quickly, hers an example of how buggy this is... If you don''t want
      to figure out a puzzle just reach through the wall holding the gold block your
      supposed to unlock and grab it instead. Puzzle defeated.


      Now don''t get me wrong, if the developer gets the bugs fixed and improves the
      game it does have potential.'
