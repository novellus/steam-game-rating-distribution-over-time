If this really is version 0.1 as it says, this game is really good.  It's far from a complete game, but still very playable and great for kids.  I'm using a Valve Index, and the controls are really nice in this game, and the graphics are awesome in Ultra.  I just wanted to start out my Valve Index experiences with a decent \"Iron Man\" type of flying game to see how it made me feel, and this one was perfect!  It's simple and easy to learn and play, and actually makes me a little dizzy hopping from skyscraper to skyscraper, and I even get cramps in my legs from balancing a lot when I think I might fall off of ledges or buildings.\n\nSure, it's a little silly hunting cute kitties, but I like it.  And my grandkids just love it.  I only hope they add the ability to reset the game to the beginning again, because before my grandkids even tried it, I had already captured most of the kitties and had already upgraded my boosters to the max, so there was little left for them to do except fly around and explore.  I assume (and hope) there will be a lot more added to this game in future versions, including that reset option.  This game really has great potential and I'm looking forward to what its future holds.\n\nIf there's a way I could even delete my save data on Steam for this game, I would greatly appreciate the how-to from anyone... I already tried an uninstall and re-install, but it still remembers.  And I also tried searching for any leftover files for the game on my system after uninstalling, and deleted those, then re-installed, but it STILL remembered.\n\nGreat game though, I recommend it, even in its version 0.1 state.\n","timestamp_created":1609094275,"timestamp_updated":1609094275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+8Pf0vYCe4vrvQI="}
