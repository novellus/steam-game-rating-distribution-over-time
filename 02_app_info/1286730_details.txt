I've played ‘one-more-turn’ games all my life. Epicinium is different because I have to keep playing until the end — which means I have to play all the turns.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/bigbossbattle.com\/epicinium-preview-victory-at-what-price-though\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Big Boss Battle<\/a><br><br>“It's an interesting take on the genre.
