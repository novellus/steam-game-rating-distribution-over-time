    about_the_game: "Have you ever dreamed of sailing along your favorit coastline\
      \ or among the tropical islands of the South Pacific?<br>Maybe you prefer the\
      \ challenge of sailing across the Southern Oceans enduring the fiercest storms\
      \ they have to offer?<br>Or you just wish to learn to sail but have no access\
      \ to a boat to do so?<br><br>With Sailaway you can do all of these things. Sailaway\
      \ - The Sailing Simulator brings all the world's oceans to the comfort of your\
      \ PC or Mac for you to experience the ultimate in online virtual sailing!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Warning</h2>Sailaway is not a game. It is a simulation with\
      \ an active community of sailors and sailing enthusiasts. There are no targets,\
      \ goals, quests, sea monsters, health or mini games. Please do not buy Sailaway\
      \ if you expect otherwise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sail around the world</h2>In\
      \ Sailaway, the oceans of the planet are simulated with unparalleled accuracy\
      \ at actual scale. A trip across the Pacific will take months, just as it would\
      \ on a real boat. With a persistent online world, adjust your settings and your\
      \ boat will continue to sail even if you aren\u2019t online.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Race against others</h2>Since all sailboats are in the same world and can see\
      \ each other, it is also possible to race together. Sailaway has a system in\
      \ place that will display a start line, race buoys and an automatic finish line.\
      \ The start countdown is the same as in the real world with flag and sound signals.<br>Races.\
      \ The race agenda is full of races that are organized by the community of sailors.\
      \ There are long distance races that will take several days or even months to\
      \ complete. And of course there are also shorter races where there is more direct\
      \ interaction between the boats.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Race together</h2>Instead\
      \ of all competitors sailing in their own boat, you can also assemble a crew\
      \ and sail together on 1 boat. To prevent an unfair advantage, race organizers\
      \ may limit the number of sailors on one boat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Set a record</h2>There\
      \ is also the concept of &quot;Challenges&quot;. These are laid out tracks that\
      \ can be sailed at your convenience. The sailor with the fastest time holds\
      \ the record. You can compare this with the Jules Verne Trophy or the Transatlantic\
      \ record.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Learn to sail</h2>The good thing about a simulation\
      \ is that nothing can go wrong and there are tutorials to get you started with\
      \ the basics if you need. Feel free to practice until you get the feel for the\
      \ wind and the position of your sails to make the boat move forward. The simulation\
      \ can assist by pressing the &quot;helping hand&quot; button. and it can perform\
      \ certain tasks for you, so you can focus on one aspect at a time.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Optimize sail trim</h2>The boats in Sailaway are equipped with a full\
      \ range of trim lines for each sail. Outhauls, cunninghamholes, barberhaulers,\
      \ travellers, backstays, everything to give full control over the shape of the\
      \ sails. This shape will not only change visibly when a trim line is adjusted,\
      \ but this will also affect airflow and ultimately boat speed just like it would\
      \ in the real world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Navigate coastal waters</h2>Over 500,000\
      \ buoys, lights and other seamarks will help you navigate along your favorit\
      \ coastline.<br>You can plan your trip, set waypoints and avoid shallow areas\
      \ and rocks. For some areas the community members have made high detailed height\
      \ maps and even added accurate models of real world buildings, structures and\
      \ lighthouses. The rest of the world will display buildings from Open Streetmap."

    review: 'Horrible UI and controls. Absolutely rubbish I would say.

      Camera makes me sea sick. A lot of bugs here and there.


      Physics are patetic. You cannot break a boat or collide. No docks or ports.


      Basically its an arcade ''pull a line to sails'' simulator
