There is zero hand holding even to the point of not being sure what different items do until you perhaps find some way to use them. The game doesn't really point you to any direction pretty much ever, so there's a lot of wandering around wondering what to do next and where to go, but there are some more or less cryptic hints on the walls that you can read.\n\nAt first the controls took a bit of time to get used to. This can be controlled solely with mouse or with keyboard and mouse. No controller support whatsoever, but you kinda need the mouse cursor to play the game a lot of the game is about hovering the cursor over the enemies to see their stats and sometimes the enemies are too far from the player character.\n\nThe combat is all about looking at the stats of the player and the enemies and deciding to make your move with that knowledge. The enemies don't move and only stand in one place, often blocking doors, entrances and items, and they don't attack before you attack them. You go next to them and click on them, and based on their stats and your stats they lose a certain amount of HP and you lose too. You can see how much HP the enemies have and how much HP one hit from you takes off them and how much HP gets taken from you with that click as well. If the power of your click exceeds the amount of HP the enemy has, it dies and doesn't take any HP from you during the final blow (that is very important to know when calculating how many times you can hit them).\n\nIf you go ahead and fight the enemies without thinking it any further, you will die very quickly. It's very important to think before you hit an enemy, because you have to be aware of how many health potions you have and when you should use them, and which enemies you should choose to fight and when.\n\nYou will gain experience points for defeating enemies and every time you level up you will get your HP meter filled up, so that's something you should be watching too and use that to your advantage. When you are strong enough, some enemies will become one-blow kills that don't take away your HP at all and instead basically will give you free HP.\n\nThe enemies don't seem to spawn back so the ones you have killed will stay dead.\n\nApparently there are intentional possibilities for sequence breaking too so there are multiple ways to go further.\n\nRight now I'm contemplating on whether or not to buy health potion with the little money I still have and if I should use that to be able to get rid some tougher enemy blocking a path somewhere, or if with more exploration I could find another way to proceed. Maybe I will end up needing that money further in the game...\n\nIt's a really good and mysterious game and especially if you like \"open world\" top down retro adventures with zero hand holding and Zelda 1 style world map progression (no screen scrolling) I recommend this to you 100%.","timestamp_created":1608068968,"timestamp_updated":1608068968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5KWYtPYCcYnGugI="}
