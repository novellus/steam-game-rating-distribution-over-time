    review: "LOCIS is a horror game lacking in variety and  intrigue, beyond the first\
      \ hour of learning the game there is really nothing more to see. You walk through\
      \ endless corridors that all look the same with nothing happening for 10 minutes\
      \ until you interact with a 'Monster' which can range from small inconvenience\
      \ to instant death, making the game feel random and unfair at times. There are\
      \ notes scattered through out the game that could build intrigue and give clues\
      \ to secrets, but I have found they lead to nothing except another different\
      \ looking room among the endless corridors. LOCIS has a good start, but not\
      \ enough in the game to be considered finished. I applaud the developers for\
      \ what they were able to make with little budget and two person work team, but\
      \ I can't say I enjoyed the experience.\nEdit: After playing another hour, I\
      \ realize the game play itself isn't captivating. Not only is the game simply\
      \ a series of doors along a hallway randomly generated, the rooms in said hallway\
      \ lack variation to keep it interesting. Different  areas are simply hallways\
      \ with minor variations, making encountering new areas not even exciting more\
      \ of a name change, the only areas with intrigue were either way to short (being\
      \ a 5 second walk) or being a literal singular room. The only idea I found quite\
      \ interesting was the Wayfarers. A group of beggars that you can give part of\
      \ your soul to to gain a key, or you may leave them to their own devices and\
      \ they die, letting you gain more soul. Other then that I find the experience\
      \ boring and slow, to the point where playing is an actual chore. As I said\
      \ before, This game needs more, there are notes that lead to nothing, doors\
      \ that lead to nothing, characters that lead to nothing, and most of all game\
      \ play that leads to a boring experience. \nEdit but Again: Finished the game,\
      \ everything I said still stands, except the ending is very underwhelming."
