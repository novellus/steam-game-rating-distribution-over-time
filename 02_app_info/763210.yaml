      /><br>   It's the year 2047. Bionic prostheses are extremely prevalent in the
      world. People blindly buy bionic organs. The fact that the protheses break down
      after a short time was not classified, but was mostly overlooked and neglected
      by the richest part of population. One of the largest factories in this industry,
      Pjural, stored industrial waste in a properly designated sector D. The waste
      was stored underground. Many talented people have been extracting, reworking
      and selling these parts. <br>The first town of Landfill was founded and Sector
      D began to grow.  There, we meet our hero who after many years spent in the
      sector had ceased to resemble a human. <br><br>   The main character, Amelon,
      leads the life of a hermit. Everything that he has achieved, he achieved by
      himself. His house consists of a small junkyard, a charging station, a film
      projector, a windmill, and a machine that extracts parts from the underground.
      His day consists of collecting and extracting parts. However, such a large number
      of bionic prostheses disturbs memory. Every day he remembers less and less.
      He distances himself from his past and forgets his relatives. Amelon is aware
      of the danger, so he records a message for himself about where and who he is.
      The day is coming when he doesn't remember anything. <br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763210/extras/gameplay.jpg?t=1562935662"

      many riddles, difficult choices and adventures on the way. We can collect new
      items, improve mining machines and the like.  In the meantime, memories of the

    short_description: It's the year 2047. Amelon extracts parts in the waste dump
      of the factory producing bionic organs. After the years, he records a message
      for himself in case of loss of memory. This day comes when we first load the
      game. We explore the world and rediscover our past. Everything changes.

    review: 'Nothing works as it should:


      - Right from the bat, the music volume doesn''t change anything. That''s 33%
      of the available options. I didn''t test the other 2.


      - The voices can''t be understood in English. Their accents make them sound
      like parodies, but they are not. They are supposed to be a tutorial.


      - There are papers scattered on the ground to be read. However, their font size
      is 3 pixels high. Utterly illegible and pointless.


      - The controller has 1 stick that is functioning. Badly. Nothing else. It''s
      useless.


      - Shifting to keyboard, plenty of keys randomly mapped, but you still need the
      mouse for some stuff.


      - Trying all keys systematically, I transformed into a car. It moves differently.
      I failed to transform back into a walker.


      I''ve seen a few other bizarre things, but I don''t want to spend more time
      on this review that they actually spent polishing their game.'
