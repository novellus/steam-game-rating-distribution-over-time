At the seek part, yu have to find an orb, which has a line moving towards it, for like  15-20 seconds, if you're wondering, but you still have to hide from the monsters.\nThis game tells us much more about the story in the 123 Slaughter Me Street world than the first one, so if you're playing for the story, I recommend this one more, of course, you should play that one, too.\nThe atmosphere is great again, but while the first one wasn't really scary, this made me feel very anxious and stressful.\nI definitely recommend buying this game, especially with this price, but you should play the first one, too. Both of them is worth the purchase.","timestamp_created":1609074549,"timestamp_updated":1609074549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kKSU0vYCfZPfvQI="}
