The writing is great, the art is solid, the gameplay is fun and  the characters are interesting. The story hints at connections between characters and a deeper world that I really want to dive into, but sadly this is all there is so far. Really hope it gets a sequel, a spinoff, a novel, anything to get into the wealth of unexplored backstory. Surprised I couldn't even find fanart or fanfiction of the game.\nAlso absolutely adore the nod to the Lusty Argonian Maid of Elder Scrolls fame. Very cute.","timestamp_created":1609898867,"timestamp_updated":1609898867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k+fc6vYCeujwwAI="}
