    review: "Edit: There has since been an HD version of this experience released,\
      \ so I do NOT recommend you buy this one. \nHere is the new version:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/953840/Apollo_11_VR_HD/\n\
      \nPretty cool experience for what it is. It's an older VR title so don't expect\
      \ anything too crazy. I thought sitting in the living room and watching the\
      \ TV was more interesting than being in the rocket...but that's just me.\n\n\
      This might not be a bad introduction to VR experience for some people you want\
      \ to show off your kit to. Maybe better for someone who likes educational/experiential\
      \ things more than games or cartoons."
