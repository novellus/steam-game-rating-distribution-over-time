To this end I think the game accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. I personally am uncomfortable with highly realistic VR games where you kill other people as I find it sickening. Not in the \" I find killing people in video games morally reprehensible\" way but more actually feeling sick as my brain watches me stab someone. This does a good job of letting you hack and slash in VR without feeling like a sadist as your blade gets stuck in the flesh of your enemy that you do not even know why you want them dead. \n\nI have so fare been able to find replayability by giving myself different challenges and I look forward to future options allowing more such challenges.\n\nI would say if you wanna play a game where you can fight for high scores with your friends and you want to try it in early access. This one fits the bill. If you want a hyper realistic and fully completed game try something outside of early access. This game will likely never be a hyper realistic VR experience and I consider this a good thing.\n\nI have a couple criticisms of this game but it is in early access. So more a reaching out to the dev to look into. \n1.) There is no story I would like this to change\n2.) The movement needs some more options. It will be hard for players that get motion sick to play the game. either with smooth motion or with the lunge motion. I personally have some complaints with the player collision being dictated by the center point (represented by the red wire frame ball) I like to see if I am going to hit a wall based on where I am standing. But I also see that this is to prevent players going through walls.\n\nAll in all I look forward to the further development of this IP and will continue to follow it.  Thanks for bringing me back to playing games in my buddies basement. Its been fun so far.\n","timestamp_created":1562894233,"timestamp_updated":1562894233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47386401891708374","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1563414671,"developer_response":"I'm very happy to hear you've had fun playing wots and will work on a good narrative to go with the campaign, I always like to hear about people who have fun playing as at the end of the day, that is the greatest reward for a developer."}],"cursor":"AoJ42q3w8esCdfaUzgE="}
