At the end of the first round, the first three killed will go back to the lobby. Each kill a player gets increases its base stats in 10%, stacking at 30%, at most, each round.

Staying alone on the center circle will do the job. The progress of the digging is the same for all players. Once the treasure is on surface (or 6 minutes later), the duo which dig most and the duo with most kills will have a final fight for the treasure.
