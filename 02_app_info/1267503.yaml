    review: "I'm a bit disappointed with this addon. \n\nPros U36C in CRR livery,\
      \ comes with coal hoppers ( resused i think), and reskin potential\n\ncons:\
      \ same reused engine sounds ( does not sound like a U36C prime mover that well)\n\
      K5LA horn when they had RS5Ts or S3Ls ( I looked at pictures of them)\nTerrible\
      \ Bell resued audio\nspindomiter does not show exact speed limit \n\nHighly\
      \ recommend getting on a sale"
