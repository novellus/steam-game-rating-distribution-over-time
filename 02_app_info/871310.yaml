    reviews: "\u201CFrom the minute I sat down to play this beautiful game I was instantly\
      \ drawn into the setting and theme. ARC Savior is a top end space shooter that\
      \ resembles the likes of Mass Effect, Star Fox &amp; Star Citizen all mixed\
      \ into one mega space fighting experience. With its customizable ship and weapons\
      \ options to its huge open battleground,  ARC Savior really hits the nail on\
      \ the head in bringing a great immersive experience. I would highly recommend\
      \ this title as one to watch for those who, like myself, have a great love for\
      \ space shooting related games.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.thesoundarchitect.co.uk/dublin-games-festival-2018-event-audio-picks/?fbclid=IwAR3l_DhI1Rci9QB93yM4bkSxJiAk-pqFGazkuuN2Sv5wTTwJzb8Lykfvh-E\"\

      Arc Savior is amongst the most impressive single person projects I\u2019ve seen\
      \ in gaming. What makes Arc Savior stand out is it\u2019s sheer scope and scale\
      \ for a one person project. The game controls incredibly well on PC, with snappy\
      \ and responsive locomotion and aiming.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://geekireland.com/dublin-games-festival-irish-indies-arc-savior/?fbclid=IwAR2bMj7-NTef9pbbAsuPrRYZjcc8smVAUGMh8gcoiYn-D2TZDNTdsCMBTGA\"\

    review: "I used to play one game at a time. \n\nNow I want to play a rotation\
      \ of games at the same time: one third person, one strategy, one RPG and one\
      \ space ship. \n\nI think I found my space ship game.\n\nControls are exactly\
      \ where they should be. Visuals are cool. Sound effects, too. And you fly 3D,\
      \ not 2D as some space games around. And it\xB4s not super hard as some other\
      \ games.\n\nLooks like I will have a lot of fun with this one.\n\nUPDATE: I\
      \ got back to this game after almost a year. Sadly, it gets ridiculously hard\
      \ after, like, five missions, with more than eleven to go.\n\nI don\xB4t play\
      \ games to get upset and waste time trying to find trainers and cheats that\
      \ only work if you pay. \n\nI don\xB4t mind a difficulty curve, but a game that\
      \ gets this hard so early... like, how can I shoot down a cruiser if there are\
      \ five, six other ship shooting at me from all different angles??\n\nIf mission\
      \ five is like that, I don\xB4t want to try to finish this game.\n\nChanging\
      \ my review to \"Not Recommend\".\n\nUPDATE 2: Changing my review back to \"\
      Recommend\". I came back to the game, changed my strategy here and there, and\
      \ managed to pass the mission.\n\nThe next mission already seems hard as *ell,\
      \ but the fact that I missed the game enough to come back to it was enough for\
      \ me to try again. I\xB4ll try again, one mission at a time.\n\nSo, that\xB4\
      s it. Be advised. I recommend it. It\xB4s a good arcadey space ship game (if\
      \ that\xB4s what you\xB4re after), BUT expect sudden spikes in difficulty."
