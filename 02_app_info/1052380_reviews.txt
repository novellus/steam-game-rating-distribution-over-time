Does take some good hand eye coordination to play. If you have a few hours you can probably get through it quickly. Me on the other hand like to take my time. Art work from the talented mind of Trent Kaniuga. While many might not agree, I can't help but having visions of the movie \"9\"! Play it for free, spend the $5.00 and support it!","timestamp_created":1566267906,"timestamp_updated":1566267906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/fK11uwCeYTZ0AE="}
