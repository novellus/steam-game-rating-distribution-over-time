My impression from the product description was that it would include substantial singleplayer content to improve the protagonist's rig, but in reality all you get from all three packs combined are some entirely unnoticeable 25% \"boosts\" to drill strength, claw strength, and arm sweep combo. That sounds like something, but trust me - not a single boss battle is shortened as a result, and the upgrades are indeed 100% unnoticeable in the single player campaign. \n\nNo regrets really, since it was just a dollar and the base game was fantastic, but with Multiplayer dead this game's DLC is entirely skippable. Check out Lost Planet 3's cinematic story for sure though!","timestamp_created":1607480294,"timestamp_updated":1607480294,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp9fSovYCf7SnuAI="}
