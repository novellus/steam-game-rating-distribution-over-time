Game is mostly you running in small mazes looking for the next trigger to proceed further while avoiding the monster by running away from it.  Very little notes to find.  You'll mostly just find a few id cards telling you the bio info about people you don't know.  The worst part of the experience for me was right near the end you are not given a choice but if you do not perform the action you die which will do the following:\n\n1.  Change the default language to Spanish\n2.  Cause you to have to reset the language into English but give you a warning in Spanish before you change it to English.\n3.  Find out that the warning in Spanish was actually telling you changing the default language will erase any saved progress.\n4.  Lose all 45 minutes I just played.\n\nRefund requested.  Kudos to the sound though.....","timestamp_created":1581876948,"timestamp_updated":1581876948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598751664161682129","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwtXNp/ACfOjb8gE="}
