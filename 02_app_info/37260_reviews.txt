In those 20 years, a number of things have changed, and although a number of the character names will be familiar, their personalities and motivations have changed.\n\nYou take the role of Petra, a Detective, who is initially hired to find a missing person. That goal expands throughout the game. There also is ANOTHER underlying more personal case for Petra that spans the entire game. As Petra, you will not only visit the Emerald City, but you will also visit other lands of Oz as well\n\nThe mechanics of game play are nicely woven to where the player is never at a loss as to what they must do, thanks to a hint system that provides as much or as little assistance as the player likes. The voice acting for all of the characters is excellent. Petra, for example, comes across as your typical hard boiled gumshoe. The other character voices fit just as well.\n\nThe only negative for the game is that the cursor 'shimmers' in Windows 10, but not so badly as to disrupt the game. So that is merely a small annoyance. The video is crisp, for a 10 year old game, and the sound is excellent.\n\nThe game can probably be beaten in 5 hours or less, so that should be taken into account when deciding on a purchase.\n\nI give the game a solid  4 stars out of 5.","timestamp_created":1558676308,"timestamp_updated":1608407485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pNGjvvYCdvfiwQE="}
