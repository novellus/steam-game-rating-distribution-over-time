For some reason I thought this would be a Metroidvania title, but instead its closer to that of an endless runner that rotates levels daily, monthly, or you can select a random run.\n\nGraphically its simplistic, and certainly doesn't feel anywhere nearly as polished as Killer Queen Black. You seemingly just run forward, jumping to collect flys while avoiding enemies, spikes, and pits. You can occasionally find a berry and transform your character, the same as in KQB, but here your goal it to get a high score, or perhaps reach the end although I don't think I'll be finding out because I suck at the same but I'm also not having that much fun with it either. \n\nThe platforming and movement feels a bit too weighty for me, the graphics are rather basic and at times glitchy, and as someone that loves chiptune usually the music here isn't my cup of tea. As protoype and proof of concept this is fine, but it needs a lot more polish and well...everything before I'd recommend it to anyone. I know I didn't play for all that long, but I've already lost the drive to keep playing, and honestly that makes me feel bad/sad.","timestamp_created":1604038697,"timestamp_updated":1604038697,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486631006002426147","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4goSKvPUCffH/qgI="}
