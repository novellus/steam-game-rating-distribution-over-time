Dev is actually really active to take all the feedback from players (i'd say everyday) and really efficient so this is really reassuring to see that :). \n\nSo much fun already even at this early state, i stick to it for months now and even more as the community starts to grow!\nSo do not hesitate to try it even more if you come from games like Battlerite for exemple, you'll definitely love it!\n\n","timestamp_created":1604490852,"timestamp_updated":1604490852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6u7GyfUCdvOdrAI="}
