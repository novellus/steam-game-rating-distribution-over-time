Why? Because it's really not a well written or properly translated game. English is obviously not the developers' primary language, and yet the game was developed in English. This leads to plenty of mistranslated or awkwardly translated phrases and sentences that can have a very unintentional effect on the story throughout. Additionally, the story was simply not well written at all. All the emotional responses were more like a child trying to process adult emotions and various memories rather than the actual adult presented within doing so.\n\nWhile I appreciate the concept and the simple artistic style (and the rain is also a nice touch), the writing does not carry the concept well. Additionally, puzzles are just dropped in with no real context, and while they aren't particularly difficult, they also don't really make much sense at all.\n\nI do hope this developer either learns better English for his/her next effort (assuming it too will be published in English) or at the very least gets some better translation programs (or translators) and also works on actual story development from more than the most simplistic of places. Additionally, puzzles should make some sort of contextual sense and I'd like to also see some work on this. I'll be following this developer's future efforts, but I can't recommend this particular one.\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.
