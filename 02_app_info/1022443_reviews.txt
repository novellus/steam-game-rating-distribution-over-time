More like Golbae, amirite?[/h1]\n\nSeriously though, if it's not obvious, I like Golbez quite a bit. Dare I say he's my favorite Final Fantasy character? Yes, yes I dare. My favorite item in this set is Bad Blood III because the yellow accents vibrantly compliment the dark blue shade of his armor and makes him look like his SNES incarnation. I also really enjoy the Snowfall Scales because the white dragon contrasts very nicely against Golbez's dark armor. \n\nOn the off chance you're reading this Square/Koei, I would love it if Golbez's \"Man in Black\" attire from [i]The After Years/Dissidia 012[/i] was added as a 3rd costume set. Despite my misgivings towards games with way too many DLC items, a Golbez \"Man in Black\" costume set is something I would buy immediately no questions asked.\n\nEDIT: If you do by chance create Golbez's Man in Black appearance and dare tack on a ridiculous $12 price-tag like the recent Terra, Kefka, Ramza, and Zidane appearance and weapon sets, you can absolutely forget about it.","timestamp_created":1553894365,"timestamp_updated":1559079236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmqaXgOsCeNWNvgE="}
