    review: "When I watched a friend of mine play this game, it reminded me of the\
      \ golden age of flash games when I was a kid. In other words, a game made on\
      \ a ridiculous premise and exploring gameplay based around the concept. In the\
      \ case of Roundabout, take a limo that can only do donuts and try to get from\
      \ point A to point B as fast as possible without dying. \n\nGameplay wise, I\
      \ very much enjoy it. You can replay any mission an infinite amount of times\
      \ with whatever abilities you unlock later in the game. Every mission has objectives\
      \ that cannot realistically be done in one playthrough of the mission. Thankfully\
      \ you can do a run through focused on completing only one task on the checklist.\
      \ For example, collecting all of the collectible star coins in the mission.\
      \ The game remembers which collectibles you had already collected through your\
      \ sunsequent playthroughs so you can focus on only collecting the coins you\
      \ have missing. The game has both friends list and global ranking systems with\
      \ friends list being used for all activities and global only being used on challenges\
      \ (which are repeatable with no real point other than to flex among your friends\
      \ and the player base). \n\nThere are however some issues with the game. If\
      \ your limo dies and the previous checkpoint was on top of a building, you will\
      \ die again as the limo gets respawned inside the building rather than on top.\
      \ Further complicating things is that there is no way for players to know how\
      \ much money they have while driving unless they drive over a purchasable property\
      \ or collect a hidden money stash. The game also does not tell you how many\
      \ star coins you have left to find when doing another runthrough of a mission\
      \ only getting an update when you run over a new star coin. Another bug I found\
      \ was that sometimes when you respawn your car starts off in a damaged state\
      \ (you can take damage 4 times before dying on a fifth hit) which ruins any\
      \ flawless or time trial attempts.\n\nI give the game an 8/10. It is a corny\
      \ gem that does a lot of things right for completionists, though some bugs and\
      \ oversights do make 100% the game frustrating."
