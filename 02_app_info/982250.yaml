      of the underworld, working for the Skeleton Queen. The campaign features monsters,
      bosses, traps, more monsters, and plentiful loot. As a unique feature, you can
      also hurt your co-op partners, so taking revenge on a loot ninja is finally
      possible. The game itself features mechanics that make it much more challenging
      than your average action RPG, so beware!<br><br>The spoils of thine plunder
      await thee, go forth and claim them!
