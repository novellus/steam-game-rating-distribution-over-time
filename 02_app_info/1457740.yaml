    review: 'I don''t know where to start. This game is absolute amazing and I''m
      going replay it for the other endings. The story is pretty cool, I love the
      graphics which remind me of the good old playstation 1 games. The music is fitting
      and I just stood there and was listening to it, because I enjoyed it a lot.

      You can make many decisions even when it''s really short. I highly recommend
      the game if you like a good and interesting story.'
