However, I expected a lot more than what was in the DLC, there were hardly any tiles. I would reccomend this fully if it was $5 instead of $10, but for 10 dollars I was expecting much more.","timestamp_created":1536169359,"timestamp_updated":1536169392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.768473982810974121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Ja11eUCdOuKqgE="}
