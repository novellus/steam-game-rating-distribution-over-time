The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent developer Rafael Garc√≠a.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is the second entry of the series, set in a police station.  Johnny has been accused of having something to do with the disappearance of his mother, and has been locked up for interrogation by some men-in-black style government suits.  Our goal is to escape the police station and track down the aliens.\n\nThis game is somewhat easier than the first game in the series, in my opinion, and so my playtime with it is a bit shorter.  However, I think the story is more interesting and the puzzles are better designed.  Johnny has mellowed out a bit, except for a notable part where he nearly kills an innocent dude by aggravating his severe allergies just to get at a set of keys.  We meet some interesting and funny supporting characters, and we have a lot more going here than we did in the first entry.\n\nIf you have played the first entry in the series and are on the fence about picking up the other ones, I would definitely recommend doing so.  This game would also be a decent jumping-on point for the story if for some reason you want to skip the first one.  The story ends on a TO BE CONTINUED, so if you get this one, definitely pick up the third and fourth ones as well.\n","timestamp_created":1609637242,"timestamp_updated":1609637242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyeT24vYCf9P1vwI="}
