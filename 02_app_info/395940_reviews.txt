It was the most fun I had after a really long time my friends in a semi arcadish game. This totally reminds me of the arcade game tank. Lovely visuals & animations. totally fun with more players online! I would totally recommend this game!! This only issue i thought were the points mentioned below.\n1) It would be nice if you could tell be the right click was a switch weapon button and I had to fire with my primary button. (It took me a while to figure it out).\n2) I want to PLAY this game more... But if therea re no friends i cant play it. =( ... If you could add a challenge mode or something I can play and improve my skills when my friends are not around will be excellent!!\nIf these 2 are addressed I would be super happy and give you 10/10!!","timestamp_created":1494928540,"timestamp_updated":1494928540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449589699506759644","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwluiriNwCe8yfeQ=="}
