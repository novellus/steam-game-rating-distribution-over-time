The idea intrigued me and seemed a mash-up of several ideas which struck a chord with me.\n\nThe developer seems to be two guys and not a studio, so I didn't expect great leaps and bounds, but from my time playing I can say it's been fun.  Though I may need new fingers lol.\n\nI've completed the first part of the storyline (I think) and am not collecting resources, mining, fighting and refining to complete the NPC's missions.\n\nStuck at the moment on George Town desert, if you know where the eggs come from let me know lol!\n\nI'll keep returning to this one and see what the developers make of this game.  I'll update my thoughts later.\n\nReally enjoying the game so far!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1586688250,"timestamp_updated":1586688250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534968435764312744","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwiar/tvECdPGVgAI="}
