In my opinion Grab Lab is well worth 75 cents and the 361 megabytes of space it consumed on my hard drive.\nAnd it's fun to say Grab Lab.\nTry it with your friends.\n\nThe core gameplay involves you pressing a single button which activates the grapple of your ever-walking hero.\nThe goal is to use the grapple to move your hero onto surfaces, around which he or she always walks in a clockwise direction. Use the grapple to avoid obstacles and traps, and navigate each level in order to pick up strange chemical concoctions.\nIn some levels there is a special bolt, which really looks like a nut, which you can collect. Enough of these allow you to progress to the next set of levels, and eventually unlock an achievement. \nCollecting the chemical potions will allow you to also perform some weird science to change the looks of your hero. If you fail on a level you can alternatively use 10 of those potions to continue without losing your progress, however I think you're best to save them for weird science.\n\nThe puzzles are simple. Few are very challenging although many of them require good timing on your single button press. A few require diabolical timing. This is really the only challenge of the game, however the whole experience is relaxing. \n\nI recommend playing Grab Lab. And I recommend saying Grab Lab repeatedly. Just say it. Grab Lab. It sounds good.\nGrab Lab.","timestamp_created":1604307626,"timestamp_updated":1604307626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgfWLxPUCd9HgqwI="}
