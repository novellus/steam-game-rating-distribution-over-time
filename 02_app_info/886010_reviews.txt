Each level (except for a couple of boss levels) is just killing a certain number of pumkins (which keep spawning until you reach your quota) and then rushing to the exit. There story is barely there. There are a few different types of pumpkin footsoldiers and only two weapons. The engine isn't great and can be a bit buggy, and every time a punpkin touches, you, it's an insta-kill.\n\nThis is like an early-2000s freeware game. If you were on the Clickteam/Gamemaker scene at the ime, you've seen many games like this, and better than this, for free. Not super bad or unplayable, just amateur and too generic. The sort of game programmers make to get experience and hone their skills","timestamp_created":1543637393,"timestamp_updated":1543637393,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525282680988311768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45qv9s+cCerOStAE="}
