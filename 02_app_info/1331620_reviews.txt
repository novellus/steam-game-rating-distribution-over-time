The story is intelligent, the writing is evocative yet concise, and art/audio fit perfectly, strengthening immersion into the story.\nHope the author(s) make more games <3.\n\nEDIT oh, seeing my posted review, one last thing to temper expectations: it's short. Appears as 3+ hours because I had the game paused while running for an errand, but it's shorter.","timestamp_created":1609535858,"timestamp_updated":1609536008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9M303/YCc6XCvwI="}
