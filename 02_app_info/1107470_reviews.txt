It isn't insanely hard (except for a certain optional dungeon) and provides a decent challenge for any level gamer. \n\nNow while all of that is awesome, there is much more to this game than meets the eye...\n\n...This game has emotion...\n\nIt's not all about scaling the mountain and saving the day. It's heart-wretching. It's heart-warming. And it's an incredible story. I'm not saying the game will make you cry (this isn't the Hallmark Channel), but it will get you invested. It deals with heavy themes and makes you care about the characters.\n\nThe beginning of the game is humble. Yet, it is the ending which sets it apart.\n\nIt is reminiscent of Undertale, but has a better story. You can see similarities in the intro story, as well as in the ending.\n\nI sincerely hope this game gets the popularity it deserves some day. But until then, I will cherish it as a private gem. Thanks Garrett. \n\nGodspeed,\nBurton\n\nEdit: I had the chance to interview the creator in a Q&A style talk!
