    review: 'This game is very fun, and has a lot of potential, if you''re considering
      buying it do it, however I''d wait for a sale unless you have extra money lying
      around.

      Suggestions:

      -increase the damage of the Luger and TT-33

      -Add a machine gun role, MG-34, MG-42, DP28, M1919 (maybe)

      -Add the British faction, I''m aware accuracy isn''t this game''s main focus
      however on the map Liberation it would be more accurate if the British were
      defending instead of the US because (as you most likely know) the USA didn''t
      get involved until 1941'
