It simultaneously feels like so much and nothing is happening at the same time. Whenever enemies spawn (this happens a lot), a screen-warping pulse goes off around them. There's barely any impact for any shots. Looks generally awful. It all feels... wrong. Ten dollars on Steam can buy you Portal 2 at full price, or it can buy you... this.","timestamp_created":1609182262,"timestamp_updated":1609182575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ma+w1fYCffaYvgI="}
