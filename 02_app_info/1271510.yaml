    review: 'Remnants of the Dawn is fun but frustrating. It''s functional but unpolished.
      It delivers action but not without headache. As I can be a bit obsessive and
      nit picky I''ll try to be summary in my critiques.


      + Character Stat Customization (Decent balance of upgrade ability and still
      fun in beginning)

      + Weapons That Actually Feel Different (melee and range have multiple types)

      + Functionally Sound (Menus, Saving, Loading, Player Prefs, etc)

      + Level Design (Good mix of maze like passages without overly complicated routes)

      + Tuned Difficulty (Fits several play styles as resources and combat can be
      altered)

      + Voice Acting (The female supporting character is well voiced)

      + Music and Ambiance (Audio fades in and out well as music and vocals transition)


      - Multiple Spelling Errors (in game world signage, dialogues, and player menus)

      - Character Movement (click = walk, double click = run, but doesn''t always
      work)

      - Character Interaction (clicking on objects is sometimes difficult)

      - Visually Challenging (hard to see some of the smaller pickups especially on
      lower graphics)

      - Lacking Options (can''t disable screen shake, can''t use controller, can''t
      use or bind keys)

      - Audio FX (The sounds play fine but don''t always fit well if that makes sense)

      - Nav Mesh Jankiness (Sometimes character movement is all over the place)

      - Voice Acting Again (The male lead voice sounds like it was recorded with a
      potato lol)

      - Inconsistent Art (Challenge with store assets is getting them to feel like
      they go together)


      Overall, Remnants of the Dawn is worth the asking price. It''s short and sweet,
      alluring, a bit janky here and there, and reminiscent of older top down dungeon
      crawlers.'
