Some, not all, of the brake vans / GUV's have opening doors showing internal detail and parcels during station stops, for some reason that is not mentioned in the blurb.\nHey Matrix.....how about reaskinning the non pasenger vehicles in to BR Blue with Parcels, Express Parcels and newspapers branding?
