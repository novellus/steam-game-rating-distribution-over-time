The scale of the gun/rifles are over sized. The animations are poor. \nAudio is poor. Guns and Rifle all sound off plus they sound weak. \nGameplay shine on on arcade as arcade is full on chaos with leaderboards and this adds alot of fun. Story was slow and not so much fun. \nThe price of the game on sale at 40% off is about right. At full price it's OK, but then I would be thinking of other wave shooters starting to get into that price range. This would lose out to say Rest in Pieces or something. \n","timestamp_created":1580999231,"timestamp_updated":1580999231,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44bi5jfACeaHG8AE="}
