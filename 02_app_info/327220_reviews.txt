Just like most of their games this one holds up to its genre. Not very challenging but nice and easy going with some funny jokes. Probably aimed at a younger audience, but this old fart enjoyed it very much. Decent Point & Click game for all ages, definitely for Daedalic fans.\n\nGame details:\nFunny, lovely art style.\nPlaytime 10 or 15 hours.\nAchievements 100%, easy.\nWell worth your money!\n\nEntertainment VS Money:\n1$Buck an hour, denied\nWait for a sale","timestamp_created":1609984614,"timestamp_updated":1609984771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u8Ck7fYCfvuUwQI="}
