In the land of STEAM EA abandonware cash-grab I’ve been burned about 90% of the time.  I think we should just rename STEAM to abandonware Kickstarter actually. In that abyss of those forever EA BS dev’s talking about the future of the game and releasing a bugfix or an update once in a great while and promising a playable game that just sits in concept forever.  It’s mostly killed the fun lifelong gaming experience for me to the point of going months or longer without even opening STEAM or gaming in general.  I understand that STEAM cannot vet people’s intensions, I get that.  But I feel like they’re using the platform to push as many games as possible in your “discovery queue” because EA increases the pool of “products” for them to pimp so it’s just more cash in their pocket without concern for the gamer.  If you’re new to STEAM or EA, take it from someone who has lost a lot, stay away from EA.  I think we should start a petition to add a filter to opt out of seeing EA titles in your queue or on STEAM home page ads.  I think its killing gaming, it is for me.","timestamp_created":1608297625,"timestamp_updated":1608297625,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487148672342300415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42saAu/YCesOXuwI="}
