      \ /><br>When she was a young girl, Nekohime dreamt of being a video game developer.\
      \ Now in her early twenties, she\u2019s abandoned that dream to focus on her\
      \ uninspiring job as a computer repair technician. There\u2019s not enough time\
      \ in the day to focus on game development \u2013 and anyway, isn\u2019t she\
      \ too old to entertain such unrealistic notions?<br><br>That is, until her childhood\
      \ friend, Clover, introduces her to the seductive Suki.<br><br>Suki is determined\
      \ to turn Nekohime\u2019s dream into a reality and finally develop a game \u2013\
      \ and she refuses to let Nekohime\u2019s self-doubt stop her. Whether she wants\
      \ to or not, Nekohime\u2019s pulled into a brand new world, alongside these\
      \ two bubbly, optimistic girls.<br><br>Will they be able to make a hit game\
      \ together, or will it all be for nought? And, in the end, will Nekohime manage\
      \ to find true love?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/685680/extras/charbanner3.png?t=1587984235\"\
      \ /><br>The unwilling heroine of the story. Her real name is \u2018Sayo\u2019\
      , but her friends refer to her by her internet handle - much to her embarrassment.<br><br>Though\
      \ she dislikes being referred to by a silly nickname she made up on the spot\
      \ when she was a kid, she exhibits a lot of catlike traits. She\u2019s always\
      \ seen in her cat-eared jacket, she likes taking naps, and she can be rather\
      \ \u2018catty\u2019.<br><br>She lacks purpose in life, and is bored by her tedious,\
      \ unrewarding job. Maybe making a video game is exactly the kind of diversion\
      \ she needs.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/685680/extras/charbanner1b.png?t=1587984235\"\
      \ /><br>One of Nekohime\u2019s closest friends. Her real name is Chika.<br><br>Though\
      \ she loves revealing cosplay and dressing in tightly-fitting spandex, she\u2019\
      s actually an elementary school teacher. She\u2019s warm, cheerful, bubbly,\
      \ and loves playing around with finger paints, which makes her a surprisingly\
      \ good fit for her job (and no, she doesn\u2019t dress quite so outlandishly\
      \ when she\u2019s at work).<br><br>Being creative, she enjoys experimenting\
      \ in the kitchen and composing music. She nominates herself as the composer\
      \ for her video game venture.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/685680/extras/charbanner2.png?t=1587984235\"\
      \ /><br>A mischievous, vixen-like girl from Nekohime\u2019s past, infamous for\
      \ encouraging her elderly grandmother to feed her laptop\u2019s D-Drive rice\
      \ for a \u2018Shinto purification ceremony\u2019.<br><br>Suki flirts with almost\
      \ everyone, to such an extent it\u2019s hard to tell whether she really means\
      \ it. She also enjoys teasing people \u2013 particularly uptight people like\
      \ Nekohime who get flustered easily.<br>She grew up in a shrine, but is worlds\
      \ apart from the image of a \u2018traditional Japanese beauty\u2019. She can\
      \ be loud and obnoxious and incredibly pushy, but she\u2019ll apologize when\
      \ she realizes she\u2019s gone too far.<br>She\u2019s also a competent digital\
      \ artist, who spent a large portion of her life drawing and uploading her pictures\
      \ online. After all, there\u2019s not much else to do at a shrine.<br><br><strong><h2\
