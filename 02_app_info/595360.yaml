    review: "PLAYSTATION 1-ASSAULT IN SPACE!?: Looking for crackers & coming together\
      \ to realise this game has the missing elements of the No Man's Sky oversimplified\
      \ space battles and also what Everspace lacks with its overprocedureal context\
      \ lead me to the suggestion that Nightstar: Rogue Wings is better than what\
      \ I considered to be also Void Destroyer's overcomplicated take on Pulsar: Lost\
      \ Colony's overdistributative means to resourcing, then realised its only flaw\
      \ was lacking content in the same spectrum as Epic was on the P.C. all those\
      \ years ago. \n\nRealising it was a chapter in the Nightstar series then played\
      \ my thoughts around into understanding it was also missing the robot it was\
      \ actually fighting against. The main problem then became a focus on such unarbitrary\
      \ aspects concluding most that the training level was 'weird' (it is like a\
      \ flight simulating duel game on the ZX Spectrum). \n\nThe fluid-reality gameplay\
      \ which realises you cannot slow down to a stop whilst playing the levels, understood\
      \ you do not have to kill everything and then sometimes you do. A times I thought\
      \ this game was amusing in the same vein as Assault was on the PS1; I played\
      \ it for the same undulating reasons, not really because it is an episode in\
      \ the Nightstar series. Epic Arcade!"
