    about_the_game: "Coda is a story-driven game that utilizes players' blinks as\
      \ the central mode of interaction, with each blink evolving the story. You begin\
      \ aboard the ship of a mythical Ferryman, tasked with shepherding souls to the\
      \ afterlife. In order to do so, you must tell him the entire story of your life\
      \ in a series of flashbacks. With each blink, time passes faster and faster,\
      \ but the Ferryman questions the truth of your story. He forces you deeper into\
      \ your painfully repressed past, revealing a tragic truth about who you were,\
      \ and who you weren\u2019t. Coda tells a relatable story about the impossible\
