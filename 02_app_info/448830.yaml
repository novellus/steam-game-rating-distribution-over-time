    review: 'I mean... I get it, but I don''t.


      Instead of being a game, this is a program for whatever reason.

      It is a simulator, if anything.


      It is a... [i]program[/i]... where you select different sounds, individually
      change their volume, pitch and speed.

      Once you''re done you save that and you can load it and play it.

      [b]That''s it.[/b]


      Also, why does the list of sounds include screaming noises, baby crying etc...?

      These are not ASMR sounds.

      And as for the actual ASMR sounds that are in the game, I mean program, there
      are barely any.

      It needs a larger library of sounds.


      I get what it''s supposed to do, and I guess it does it; I.E induce ASMR.

      But you can just search for [i]Tapping ASMR[/i], for example, on YouTube and
      get a thousands times more content for a thousand times less effort.


      Not worth the money or effort.


      [i]*Oh, and the opening screen of the game includes seizure inducing flashing
      colours.

      Great for ASMR.

      Just thought I''d let you know.[/i]
