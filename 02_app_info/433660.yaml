    review: "Didn't expect this to amount to much, but was drawn in by the colours\
      \ and block graphics as I'm a big fan of this style of graphics. Man, was I\
      \ wrong about this game!\n43 minutes in and we are still going strong, the best\
      \ part is the zombie survival basketball, not laughed so much in a long time.\n\
      \nI really hope this game gets some more work done to it as it looks like it\
      \ could amount to a real cracker.\nOnly bug we found was once on a game against\
      \ each other the ball dropped beyond the screen, but you know what, we just\
      \ went ahead and started another game and we were back to laughing our heads\
      \ of again.\nGood, old fashioned madness with great graphics, quick and easy\
      \ to learn gameplay. \n\nI really, really hope this is a big game as it holds\
      \ a ton of potential. I can't wait for a couple more mates to come round and\
      \ we can have some 4 player madness trying to score a basket whilst also trying\
      \ to launch a rocket at each other all the while dodging zombies.\n\nGreat game,\
      \ keep this going! PLEASE!!!\n\nAll this really needs now is a thumping mad\
      \ soundtrack and it will literally be total zombie, basketball, rocket madness!\
      \ LOL"
