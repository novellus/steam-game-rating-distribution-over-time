    about_the_game: "In all of America railroading\u2019s long history, no event was\
      \ greater or more enthralling than the completion of the transcontinental railroad\
      \ in 1869. And now the transcontinental railroad, along with all its steam-era,\
      \ \u201COld West\u201D appeal and challenges, comes to Train Simulator with\
      \ Smokebox\u2019s extraordinary Promontory Summit route!<br><br>In the 1860s,\
      \ the Central Pacific (later to become the Southern Pacific) and Union Pacific\
      \ built east from Sacramento and west from Omaha respectively, with each road\
      \ energized by the promise of financial rewards and government land grants based\
      \ upon the miles of road they each constructed. In April 1869 it was agreed\
      \ that the point of bonding of America\u2019s transcontinental rails would be\
      \ at the summit of Utah\u2019s Promontory Range. And thus, at 12:47 p.m. on\
      \ May 10, 1869, the Central Pacific and Union Pacific rails were joined with\
      \ the historic \u201CGolden Spike\u201D ceremony, with Union Pacific 4-4-0 No.\
      \ 119 and Central Pacific\u2019s \u201CJupiter\u201D standing pilot-to-pilot\
      \ at Promontory Summit.<br><br>The Train Simulator Promontory Summit route re-creates\
      \ the historic stage over which this remarkable railroad drama occurred, with\
      \ 68 route miles extending from Corinne, Utah over Promontory Summit and along\
      \ the north shore of the Great Salt Lake to Kelton, Utah. Set in 1869, the route\
      \ is a remarkable Train Simulator re-creation of 19th century American railroading\
      \ and its \u201COld West\u201D environment. Rugged, remote topography, tough\
      \ grades, spindly trestles, and the rough-and-tumble \u201Ctent towns\u201D\
      \ that dotted the newly constructed transcontinental line all come to enthralling\
      \ life in the Smokebox route. Centered on Promontory Summit, the route includes\
      \ segments of the railroad as originally operated by Central Pacific and Union\
      \ Pacific, and thus provides a perfect and authentic setting to put Smokebox\u2019\

    review: Wow! great job Smokebox. I just bought this and all the items required
      to run it, and I love them all. This route is really well done, love the scenery,
      although if your a fast runner this is NOT for you. The speed limit is 40 MPH,
      but with a heavy train, you'll be lucky to get 25. Right length, adequate yard
      facility's on either end, an overall just done amazingly. Scenarios are entertaining
      as well. Recommend to anyone wanting the 1860s/70s,, or for a nice route to
      run. also, for those of you who don't think there are enough engines, go to
      Railworks America and you can get repaints for more road numbers.
