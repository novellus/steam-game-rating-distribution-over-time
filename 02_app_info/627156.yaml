    short_description: A large soda, a long movie, and an out-of-order men's room
      at the local dollar theater bring about a bladder emergency for Dan on his way
      home. Sadly, Los Angeles gridlock proves to be the last straw in an already-bad
      situation, and Dan soon finds himself bent on revenge against traffic itself.
