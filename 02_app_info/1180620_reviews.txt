With the keyboard, you can only control the ship with the mouse. With the controller, you can only use the D-Pad. Using Steam controller, using the Joystick Mouse and lowering the sensitivity helps quite a bit.\n-Difficulty is absurd to the point the game is hard to enjoy. A lot of the enemies just stand still. And while they can be killed, they take too many hits to be able to be destroyed with the main weapon. These enemies get in the way of the gameplay, making it very tedious to maneuver your ship around, especially when the game speeds up.\n-Barely any power-ups spawn on Survival mode\n-Questionable collision detection\n-Interesting scoring system that is ruined by the big amount of standing still enemies,\n\n\nOther:\n\n-Hardware Requirements: Low\n-Game is family-friendly: Yes\n-Difficulty: Mostly very difficult\n-Overall game recommendation: More or less not recommended.\n\n\nAdditional notes: This game has a lot of potential to be a great game, but in its current state, the game is very tedious and difficult to play. It needs improvement badly and a lot of change, therefore I will leave a negative review until the game is improved.","timestamp_created":1582080322,"timestamp_updated":1607552887,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515919029712677002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jc3npPYCdpKZ8wE="}
