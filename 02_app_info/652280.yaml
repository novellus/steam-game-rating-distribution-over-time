    review: 'Im not even sure if this is a joke. It is possibly the most misleading
      program I have purchased on VR so far


      I was lead to believe I would be able to explore Ancient Rome.  What I got was
      a cinematic of prerended 360 scenes with no interaction, no movement and little
      in the way of 3D graphics.  There are no controls for interaction or movement
      only next, back and select.


      Being stuck in predefined places while a guy talks to you about the history
      and you just sit and listen is not exploring Rome.


      I know this is educational and I wasnt expecting much, but its Virtual Reality
      and the images are of 3D scenes and the videos are of realtime 3D environments
      with moving cameras.  This strongly gives the impression of having some degree
      of freedom and the ability to look from more than one angle
