A full set of necessary shaders will allow you to plunge into the creative process as much as possible. Many thanks to the developer, I am very pleased with the purchase.\nAt first it may seem that the process is a little incomprehensible, but after carefully reading a couple of official forums and reviewing the code (by the way, the code is quite well commented) it is quite easy to understand the whole workflow. I like.","timestamp_created":1539529538,"timestamp_updated":1539529538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588414609432220459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnY/HueYCfqvXrAE="}
