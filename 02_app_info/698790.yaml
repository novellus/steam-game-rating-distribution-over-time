    review: "[i]Played with WMR[/i]\n\nIn Paperville Panic, you take on the role of\
      \ a newly hired firefighter in a cardboard board town. As you conclude your\
      \ introductory training, fires and other mischief begins breaking out around\
      \ the city. It is your job to save the cardboard beings from hazards and uncover\
      \ the source of the current disasters.\n\nThe movement in Paperville Panic is\
      \ done by teleportation with no other alternatives options available in the\
      \ settings menu. The most notable settings available are individual knobs for\
      \ adjusting different volume option, the ability to enable or disable room scale,\
      \ and a single knob to adjust all the graphics options. With the settings menu\
      \ addressed let's get into the game.\n     \nPaperville Panic barely takes over\
      \ 2 hours to complete. These two hours are composed of a brief tutorial, exploring\
      \ the main hub area - which is a delightful looking cardboard town, and completing\
      \ a total of five missions. \n\nThe story is quite simple and is mainly delivered\
      \ as a voice-over during various missions and in the hub world. These story\
      \ updates often consist of your new boss altering you about recent events and\
      \ telling you where to find the next mission. There is just enough of a plot\
      \ to piece together the rather random events and the way the mystery unfolds\
      \ is humours enough to be entertaining while allowing for the gameplay to take\
      \ priority.\n\nThe main cardboard town acts as a menu for selecting the various\
      \ missions. Between the cars zipping around the roads,  vendors at their stalls,\
      \ and individuals casually playing cards in the park there is always something\
      \ visually engaging to look at within the main section of the town. Yet, when\
      \ you arrive at some of the areas further along the outer edges there is a distinct\
      \ lack of activity in them. They particularly stood out to me as seeming incomplete\
      \ since they take up a good chunk of space and seem like an ideal place for\
      \ adding on another mission which are a tad lacking in the game. \n\nThe five\
      \ missions available are the heart of the game and provide a good amount of\
      \ variety with decently-well crafted bosses at the end of each of them. Each\
      \ mission has a completely different thematic problem to address and a unique\
      \ water-based fire-arm to assist in tackling that situation with. You begin\
      \ by doing standard firefighter duties such as putting out flames with your\
      \ squirt gun and uncovering individuals who are buried beneath piles of rubble,\
      \ you later find yourself sorting toys and taking down criminals. This allows\
      \ for the pacing and engagement from mission to mission to be exceptional as\
      \ you find yourself encountering new objectives and new tools constantly. \n\
      \nThe quality of the combat substantially fluctuates based on the weapon that\
      \ you are using, ranging from bland to good. The one that stands out as being\
      \ the worst is the ax which is, unfortunately, the only melee weapon that you\
      \ have for the entirety of the game. The impact that this ax has when comes\
      \ to cutting down doors or breaking object is solid as the impact is visually\
      \ shown and audio cues back up the action. The biggest issue is using the ax\
      \ on enemies. For flying enemies you merely have to touch them they will simply\
      \ fall onto the ground. While standard enemies will usually let out a mild grunt\
      \ or moan when decapitated. There is also no requirement to hold the ax with\
      \ the sharp side facing the enemies, you can just slap them with the side of\
      \ it and somehow de-head them. The lack of meaningful audio cues, visual feedback,\
      \ or required precision results in a noticeable lack of impact which makes the\
      \ ax, especially for being the one melee weapon that you have during the entire\
      \ game, lame to use.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the water-based weapons are\
      \ enjoyable to use thanks to them having a solid visual splash and sound effect.\
      \ The double-barrel shotgun stands out as being particularly enjoyable since\
      \ it requires you to constantly load up new ammo in the form of water-balloons\
      \ into its chambers. The steady requirement of quick player inputs in order\
      \ to successfully operate the weapon is highly engaging. The same can also be\
      \ said for the pump-action gun as it requires accurate rapid movement in order\
      \ to refuel it. The three remaining weapons which are: the squirt gun, timed\
      \ pistol, and water balloons are all decent enough but lack the constant engagement\
      \ that the other guns provide.\n\nThe artistic design is cheerful, bright, and\
      \ charming despite the unfortunate events that are taking place. The game looks\
      \ like a kids arts and craft projects and is visually joyful to experience.\
      \ I particularly like the simple hand-drawn style of the faces for the cardboard\
      \ characters and the design of the major who has toilet paper for his head.\
      \ While it visually conveys a childish demeanor there is also a bit of edginess\
      \ mixed within the story and gameplay. This is demonstrated by how you can decapitate\
      \ civilians and the raunchy jokes that mixed in throughout the story. An artistic\
      \ area that is a bit neglected is the animation of the characters. Even the\
      \ main characters often have overly simple animation loops that look passable\
      \ at times and rather bad in other cases. There are also some rather jarring\
      \ animation shortcuts are taken at times.\n\nLastly, a lot of the game\u2019\
      s humor relies on referencing other media or games which I personally did not\
      \ care for. But there is some lowbrow humor which is entertaining for just how\
      \ dumb it can be.\n\nOverall, Paperville Panic is a tolerable title. The main\
      \ portion of the city is lively and the game\u2019s world is creatively wonderful.\
      \ But, the empty parts of the open world sections should have included two more\
      \ mission to better fill both the hub area and the overall game. However, the\
      \ missions that are included do a good job of frequently keeping the player\
      \ interested with different themes, guns, and bosses. Yet, the fluctuation of\
      \ the game\u2019s combat depending on the weapon of choice prevent the game\
      \ from being a fair title."
