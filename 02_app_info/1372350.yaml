    review: "Ok\nI played for 18min, but I have enjoyed the game this far, but before\
      \ talking about what I think I should say, I don\xB4t know how much money you\
      \ have to pay for this game, in my country it is not worth to be honest, I feel\
      \ like the game could be cheaper in early access.\n\nNow, I like the interface,\
      \ it is not that good looking for sure, but is good enough for me to point it\
      \ out (and I assure you I am very annoyed by these kind of things), it is simple\
      \ but I like the font. Now that I said that, I also like the whole vibe the\
      \ game has, like the colors it uses, being it on the text or the textures, it\
      \ just looks good like a whole environment, and I feel like some music could\
      \ help that chill atmosphere (and I just remembered that I liked the cutscene\
      \ at the start a lot xd).\nAt this point I feel like the game doesn\xB4t give\
      \ me enough reasons to search for materials, I enjoyed the fact that there\xB4\
      s cannonballs, and maybe there\xB4s more to look at (Ill be playing the game\
      \ again on these days, and I\xB4ll update this review), but the inventory is\
      \ just overwhelming, there should be a way to prioritize some items over others,\
      \ and there\xB4s the fact that everything has this similar color palette (which\
      \ works well like I said before), but in this particular case it just feels\
      \ way too messy.\nAlso, from what I understand the whole game is kinda the same,\
      \ but I feel it would be good to exploit the sense of discovery this world offers\
      \ and reduce a bit your field of view and add some danger zones with idk, floating\
      \ enemies like sky fishes or something like that, where the islands soil is\
      \ darker and the sky too or... Yeah you get the idea. Although this is just\
      \ a recommendation.\n\n\nIt would be great if you configure gamepad input, right\
      \ now I can walk with the L-joystick, and jump with Y, the game feels very fluid\
      \ at least while jumping and walking."
