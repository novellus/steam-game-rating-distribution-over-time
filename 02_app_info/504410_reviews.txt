Definitely a LGBT theme and its a point-and-click story. True to the Luke Miller brand, this game is loaded with innuendos and campy fun. Artwork is excellent for the genre that doesn't disappoint.\n\nMy only constructive feedback is that you will need to use a guide to get through the middle of the game to the end. Some scenes don't explain what you need to do and I think it was intended for \"discovery,\" but even that was too difficult. Major piece of advice is to save often.","timestamp_created":1609371951,"timestamp_updated":1609371951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+eOC2/YCd5H4vgI="}
