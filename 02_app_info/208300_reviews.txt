I was looking through my purchase history and it wasn't there then i realised i hadn't been hacked it had given it to me for free and i was saying how amazed i was to receive this for free. So even though i didn't buy and got if free i really recommend this add-on so i give it a 9/10 because it has good locos just not many. Really recommend.","timestamp_created":1609502855,"timestamp_updated":1609503035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45+n23vYCf8SwvwI="}
