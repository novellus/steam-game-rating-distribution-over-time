    review: 'Ten minuets in and I''m honestly a little disappointed...


      You can''t actually tweak all the aspects of the game like the description leads
      you to believe...the fish are nicely rendered yeah but their motions are stiff.
      Decorations and such are lacking in that you can''t place multiple items and
      click/drag them to a better spot, no distinction between salt and fresh water
      fish/decor aside from judging how they look...not only that but it looks like
      a primary school child designed the food options...


      All in all, not worth the money...if I could return it, I absolutely would...
      Hopefully the devs plan to update or fix their description or actually tweak
      the game to be what they say it is...'
