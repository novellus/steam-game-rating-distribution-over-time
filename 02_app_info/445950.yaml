    review: "The creator of this game ran a Kickstarter and abandoned it.  Backers\
      \ were never informed of the Steam release, nor were they given the Backer Rewards\
      \ they paid for.   \n\nThe last Kickstarter update was April 22, 2016, and backers\
      \ were subsequently surprised to find this game for sale on Steam.\n\nThe game\
      \ seems fine so far; the graphical style is coherent and interesting, gameplay\
      \ is entertaining; but the unethical behavior of the developer is alarming."
