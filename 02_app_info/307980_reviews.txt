Its just sheer luck. You set batsman to ultra defensive and they swing for the fences getting out, you change the bowlers, their lengths, round the wicket etc absolutely sweet nothing. I cant bat out a game to draw it without the other team ripping through my middle order yet the CPU finds it a piece of cake. On the off chance you are in command, rain stops play or as you are about to win bad light stops play! How convenient!\n\nAvoid this game at all cost and any future versions. Although not very expensive, wish I never wasted my money! If you want a game of luck just play a bit of blackjack online!","timestamp_created":1569802602,"timestamp_updated":1569802602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4djhv+0CdJSP0wE="}
