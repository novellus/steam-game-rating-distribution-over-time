It's synth-like music.\n\nThe graphics look strange but again it has to do with Vaporspace culture - look it up if you are not aware of this (I wasn't).\n\nThis game has an hypnotic / psychedelic effect on you that is hard to describe.\n\nMany ships and upgrades. \n\nIf you like shoot-em-ups and synth music, it's for you.","timestamp_created":1560303287,"timestamp_updated":1560303314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxeTUpOsCcrmfwwE="}
