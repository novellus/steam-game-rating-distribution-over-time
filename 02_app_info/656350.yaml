    review: "Pros: \n- New NPCs / Game mechanics get introduced at a good pace and\
      \ unlocking them feels satisfying\n- Polished graphics\n- Bosses have interesting\
      \ mechanics\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay is not very interesting and feels repetitive.\
      \ Almost all relics and blessings are just stat buffs, so the runs feel all\
      \ the same\n- Jump mechanic feels very awkward. It is very hard to estimate\
      \ where you are going to land and hard to steer mid-air. Platforming feels terrible.\
      \ A dash-mechanic (which most other roguelikes go for) would probably have been\
      \ better.\n- Bosses don't respawn. This is especially disappointing since the\
      \ bosses are the main strength of this game. Not being able to replay them feels\
      \ like a poor design decision.\n- Difficulty of rooms varies widely. Sometimes\
      \ your run will just end because of a room full of mines with moving sawblades,\
      \ several holes in the ground and a ton of enemies shooting at you. This kind\
      \ of rng would not really be a problem if not for the next point.\n- I don't\
      \ like that the in-run and out-of-run currencies are identical. This leads to\
      \ me never buying any expensive items in-run since the run may be over anytime\
      \ because of a very difficult room and i would rather save the gold for permanent\
      \ upgrades. I understand that this is a deliberate design decision but i personally\
      \ don't like it.\n\nConclusion:\nI am especially disappointed in this game because\
      \ the core idea is really good (of course a lot is copied from Binding of Isaac),\
      \ boss design is really cool and the game feels very polished (except the wonky\
      \ jump mechanic). But the main point of a roguelike is having great replayability\
      \ through different playstiles in different runs. Unfortunately, Undermine does\
      \ not deliver this at all. If you are new to roguelikes, this game may be for\
      \ you. Otherwise, i would rather play Hades, Dead Cells or Binding of Isaac."
