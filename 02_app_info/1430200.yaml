    review: Bought it just for Nostalgia! I spent literal years of my life playing
      SE3, modding SE3, playing SE3 some more, RPing about playing SE3, then playing
      SE3 some more. This is a very In-depth 4x strategy, with a degree of customization
      lacking in so many modern games of the genre. Graphically dated(obviously),
      but still a fantastic game to play for any fan of the genre.
