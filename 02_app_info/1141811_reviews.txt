It's just to much of the same thing. You get 2 paintings that has only 4 colors in it. Many others have so many repetitive arts. It's just feels like the artists get a bit lazy. But it's ok if you just wanna kill some time.","timestamp_created":1567889868,"timestamp_updated":1567889868,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzpjhhu0Cfszr0QE="}
