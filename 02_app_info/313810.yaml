    review: 'What is Legend of Kay ?


      Its a remaster of an old game of the PS2 era, I probably got it during a sale
      considering its a pretty cheap game and I have enjoyed a lot of older adventure/platformer
      games in the past, it looked like a promising pick so I gave it a go, as soon
      as I started I noticed a few things, the remaster does a pretty good job making
      the game run better and stable on a modern hardware, it looks nice and the game
      shows a lot of personality in its cutscenes and the way it sets the story early
      on, altho the voice acting can be kinda crappy and forced especially on the
      protagonist the main problem here is the gameplay, its just so repetitive and
      basic, if they added a little more nuance into the gameplay, a little more diversification
      or challenge, not only its too easy but since its so simplistic and safe it
      gets boring really fast and while the story starts out well I felt it wasnt
      grabbing my attention enough to keep me going so after playing it for a while
      I was having no fun anymore and had to drop it.


      Its for a reason that its a forgotten game that you dont see people mentioning
      it when someone is talking about games released during that time, because its
      just a very average game, it does the bare minimum and its not fun enough to
      warrant a full playthrough at least to me and because of that I cant recommend
      it.'
