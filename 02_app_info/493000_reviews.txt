I think I'm pretty alright at platformers but it's not really my forte, so this game is probably average to slightly difficult. The optional stuff though is another story entirely, playing with a friend we tried them and I could tell I would NOT be able to do them; He, being better than me did beat 'em with some trial and error. Speaking of, the co-op I feel adds little, it is nice to have a buddy help with some parts full of enemies. But ultimately, because the screen follows Player 1 and Parsec or Steam remote play can only do so much for input lag, it's not ideal for Player 2. Pretty decent get at the asking price, if its your bag of chips, it gets a solid recommend.","timestamp_created":1608613108,"timestamp_updated":1608613108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkoO0xPYCft+MvAI="}
