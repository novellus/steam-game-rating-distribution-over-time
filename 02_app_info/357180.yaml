    review: The awareness that grey goo (a never stopping multiplying carbonbased
      nanobot) could be real, and people should be alert not to play with things above
      their own power like nucleair power and nano tec amd body chirchury, if life
      is destroyed it never will come back. because nobody can make life. be aware
      of the dangers boring sciencetist behold when they are eager for money. dont
      play with life on a modification way and everything should be fine. like nature
      and or god instructed it to be. the concept of grey goo is science fiction but
      beware, it could be real one day.
