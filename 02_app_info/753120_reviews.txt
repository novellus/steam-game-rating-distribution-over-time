I probably would put some money into this machine but over a long period of time it would get old very quickly for me. It just dont have that wow factor for me. \n\nThe table looks great and really does pop with color and cars. The sound effects are solid. Overall It just feels a little flat for me. It doesnt surprise or wow me like their other tables in the 2017 lineup. Circus 2017 and Farfalla 2017 I was won over and surprised by the elements on the table. Example Circus 2017 starts out with multilball right from the start. Farfalla 2017 has a underneath mini table you can play on. Thats good stuff. The pinball table Haunted House(1982) had this exact same thing. They called it a cellar. \n\nIf you really want a auto themed pinball table then this would be a good buy. In real life I would probably spend $2.39 just playing this table. I do not think its their best table though. In my personal opinion Circus 2017 or Farfalla 2017 are the best tables in the lineup so far. Its a good table but not great.\n\nCurrently I have a slight issue with the table and a lock hole behind the left ramp.
