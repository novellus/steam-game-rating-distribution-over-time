    review: 'Pros :

      - The characters art isn''t really bad

      - It still have voice over

      - Trading Cards

      - Able to get perfect Achievement

      - Branching story


      Cons :

      - Story feels bland for me

      - The Voice over on Characters not set on same volume (some characters talk
      loudly, while the others talk with small volume)

      - No text animation (text appear directly)

      - Talk character animation is poor (mouth animation not different for every
      text)

      - Can''t auto (unless you want to skip), so will need to press enter/left click
      for next text manually


      Overall Score from me .-.

      6.5/10'
