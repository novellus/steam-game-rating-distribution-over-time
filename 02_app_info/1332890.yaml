      /><br><br>HopBound is a story-driven psychological horror game that revolves
      around the surreal mind of Mayumi, a recluse who must journey through an unsettling
      retro game to come to terms with the ghosts of her past. Through 16-bit horror
      platformer stages and endless runner levels with gorgeous pixel art, she discovers
      that her sanity will be tested by something lurking behind the screen.<br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>NOSTALGIC VISUALS</strong><br>Most of the game's stunning
      visuals use a palette of only four colors to evoke the retro charm of 90s handheld
      games.<br><br><strong>SPINE-CHILLING AUDIO</strong><br>Listen to unique ambient
      music that provide a sense of dream-like dread as you explore the game's sinister
      levels.<br><br><strong>A STANDALONE CONTINUATION</strong><br>Taking place two
      years after the events of DERE EVIL .EXE, HopBound serves as a continuation
      of that story. However, users do not need to play DERE EVIL .EXE to immerse
      themselves in HopBound's narrative experience.<br><br><strong>HEART-POUNDING
      MONSTERS</strong><br>Enemies from previous games are brought back to life and
      have evolved into new incomprehensible forms.<br><br><strong>MEANINGFUL MACHINATIONS</strong><br>Going
      against sequel conventions, HopBound doesn't go bigger and badder for the scale
      of its story. Instead, the game focuses inward, resulting in a haunting yet
      meaningful tale.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1332890/extras/hopboundgif1.gif?t=1605666099"
      /><br><br>HopBound has NO controller support. Please unplug any controllers
      before playing this game as it may cause movement issues for the player character.<br><br><img
