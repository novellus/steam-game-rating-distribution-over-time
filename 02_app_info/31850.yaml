    reviews: "\u201CA great adventure game that will require thought and perseverance\
      \ to finish. The story is exciting and offers a little spookiness in the beginning;\
      \ in fact, some younger players may be scared at first, which parents should\
      \ be aware of. Whether your kids are Nancy Drew fans or not, this game will\
      \ interest most teens and many adults, as well.\u201D<br>PC GameZone<br><br>\u201C\
      Ghost Dogs isn\u2019t a bad little game and deserves the FFC thumb up! It\u2019\
      s the perfect game for a beginner just starting out or an experienced adventurer\
      \ looking for a mystery that isn\u2019t too tough on those \u201Clittle grey\
      \ cells.\u201D\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Nancy_Drew_7/Ghost_Dogs.shtml\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >FourFatChicks</a><br><br>\u201CI would\
      \ recommend any and all of the titles in this series to adventure gamers everywhere.\
      \ Of the lot, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is one of the best. I am pleased that\
      \ Her Interactive acquired the rights to produce these games, and that there\
      \ are more to come. I think that if you want the gaming equivalent of slipping\
      \ into your favorite PJs and coziest chair for an engaging and fun mental diversion,\
      \ you can\u2019t go wrong with Nancy Drew in general, and Ghost Dogs of Moon\
      \ Lake in particular. So with that in mind, this reviewer highly recommends\
      \ Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.mrbillsadventureland.com/reviews/m-n/nancydrewR/nancydrew7R.htm\"\
