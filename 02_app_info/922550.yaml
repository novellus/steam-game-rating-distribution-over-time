    developer_response: 'Thank you very much for such a thorough review!

      I already learned my lesson about not combining fast-reflex levels with logic
      puzzles in one game, so never again :)


      [quote=author]The impression I get is that this game either had no playtesting
      at all [/quote]

      You almost correct, I managed to find exactly 1 tester.


      [quote=author] it lacks the one feature a game about a keyboard should contain:
      key mapping[/quote]

      Some puzzle levels make it impossible to add this feature. I did all I could
      to redesign some levels so I could add 3 most common layouts. Nothing more can
      be done, except for cutting a quarter of the game.


      [quote=author]It also offers a "color blindness" mode, but all it seems to do
      is switch green tiles for white - which is just confusing: why not use different
      shapes/fill modes for them?[/quote]

      Colorblind mode changes red/green buttons to black/white where it''s needed.
      I wanted to include all types of color blindnes with one setting, but fill mode
      is a better idea.

      Thank you for playing my game!'

    review: 'keyg is a game with a quite innovative gameplay style and some really
      interesting mechanics. However, I can''t quite call it a logic puzzle. For the
      most part, it is a skill game.

      [list]

      [*][b]Gameplay:[/b] gameplay features a handful of different room types, but
      they generally don''t diverge from those. This is my main gripe with the game,
      and the reason I cannot recommend it: at first glance, this looks like a fun
      puzzler. There were some really clever levels involving navigating with certain
      barrier-breaking items, or figuring out a set of movements. But then, in-between
      those you have levels where, unless you have really fast reflexes, will get
      you stuck for a really, [i]really[/i] long time. My strategy for the "key-mashing"
      type of levels was to basically look at my keyboard and press a series of keys
      in a loop. The problem with this approach is that it completely invalidated
      the "random enemy spawning" catch of the level, not to mention the more obvious
      issue of me not actually looking at the game at any point in that level; I''d
      just loop those keys and pray that it ended quickly. Thankfully, there are only
      three of those levels but, in my personal opinion, there should have been exactly
      zero. I''ll cover this more in the Accessibility topic.

      I appreciate that this game is not a one-trick pony. I like that it has many
      ideas it wants to explore. But with a couple exceptions, those ideas are never
      explored in innovative ways. The only element of "surprise" in this game, the
      only source of the "aha!" moment is through its riddles. Most of the puzzle
      levels are less about the environment or mechanics and more about "find the
      odd thing" or "figure out password". The game mechanics were only used as a
      means to an end, not the source of challenge itself, which in my opinion is
      just a waste of potential. My favorite levels were those that made you stop
      to think about which barriers to break, or how to navigate the room such that
      you stepped on activator keys in the correct order, but those were few and over
      rather quickly. The fast reaction levels were, at the core of it, just the same
      type of challenge in different styles. Run from the "X" key to the "Y" key as
      fast as you can. Either because red circles, or because pulsing timer with death
      keys in-between, or because another character told you to do so.

      [*][b]Physics:[/b] you''d think that, in a game about navigating with keys,
      there wouldn''t be space for physics, but here we are. The player character
      moves between tiles by sliding across in a straight line. No problem there,
      until you have to move between two tiles with one in-between. Since you [i]have[/i]
      to traverse the in-between tile, and since so many levels require fast action,
      your instinct will be to press the in-between key, then the destination key
      as soon as possible, but if you''re not at the center of the tile by the time
      you press the next, and if the player character is in the region of the in-between
      tile, then it will start swaying in the direction of the new tile from wherever
      it is, potentially hitting a wall or missing a button.

      At no point in the game does this "in-betweening" movement get implemented as
      either a mechanic/intended move or as a deliberate barrier. It''s simply a consequence
      of the fact that the player character is a physics object which doesn''t regard
      the keyboard as a grid, but just as a regular, 2D map.

      [*][b]Difficulty curve:[/b] the game starts off really easy. It lets you get
      used to the keyboard gameplay, and gradually ramps up in difficulty. So far
      so good. Then you get to the first "key-smashing" level. After that, it''s all
      game. Maze-like level design, riddles with confusing clues, sweeping puzzles
      that effectively require brute force, trial-and-error to get solved, and so
      on. The impression I get is that this game either had no playtesting at all,
      or that playtesters only played up to a certain point. It genuinely feels like
      the game takes a turn to "gameplay exploration", where a lot of ideas are explored,
      but they aren''t introduced in a well-paced manner, or aren''t explored to their
      potential.

      Instead of building up on your acquired skills and understanding of mechanics
      to derive its difficulty, it only gets progressively faster and more instinctive/reactive.
      This is evident by the fact that the early levels had absolute no randomization,
      whereas late levels almost exclusively relied on random events. If the gameplay
      was consistently about navigating levels that involved random events, it wouldn''t
      be much of an issue, but the inconsistency of having well thought out and designed
      puzzles versus what I can only described as battle arenas is remarkable.

      [*][b]Graphics:[/b] the game is minimalist in nature and feature elements comprised
      mostly of lines and solid colors. I commend the creators for that, since the
      simplicity and consistency makes the game easy to understand and navigate. However,
      I can''t help but feel like the different mechanics could have used more distinctive
      designs. Some special tiles are simply too similar to other types of tiles,
      and most of them are either rectangles or lines. I believe exploring different
      shapes and forms, while still sticking to the general "vector-like" art direction,
      would have been a wiser choice. I''ll cover this more in the Accessibility topic.

      [*][b]Music and SFX:[/b] this is one of the game''s highlights, in my eyes (or,
      in this case, ears). The game has a small but very atmospheric soundtrack that
      appropriately matches the circumstances in which it is played. It is never so
      intense as to be distracting, nor so quiet as to be dismissed. The sound effects
      are also very well designed, with each mechanic having its own characteristic
      array of sounds. It also serves as great auditory cues in levels where that
      can be helpful.

      [*][b]Narrative:[/b] the story this game tells is as simple as it can get, which
      is not a complaint, only an observation. This game features a handful of meaningful
      character, which each have their own identity and personality and role to fulfill.
      While the player character itself doesn''t have any dialogue lines, it still
      feels like an important part of the narrative, especially near the end. Writing
      was solid, jokes were okay, and general plot was serviceable. A very "by-the-books"
      story, but still entertaining, and really adds to the game.

      [*][b]Accessibility:[/b] and this right here is the reason why I cannot, in
      good faith, recommend this game. Even though I mentioned many perceived flaws
      and shortcomings with many aspects of keyg, I would have recommended it had
      it not been for the fact that, for a lot of people, this game is, and I mean
      this with no sarcasm, literally unplayable. As many mentioned, it lacks the
      one feature a game about a keyboard should contain: key mapping. While it does
      offer three keyboard layouts, it doesn''t account for the fact that some people
      have international keyboards, or just a different layout (QWERTZ, for instance).
      It also offers a "color blindness" mode, but all it seems to do is switch green
      tiles for white - which is just confusing: why not use different shapes/fill
      modes for them? But mainly, this game is completely out of reach for anyone
      with even the mildest condition that might hinder hand/finger movement or reaction
      time. If you''re not a fast typer, this game is not for you. If it takes you
      more than a fraction of a second to locate a key, this game is not for you.

      [/list]

      My hope is that, some day, some dev will see this and add features and settings
      so that more people can play the game. Be it through redesigning levels, creating
      an Assist Mode, or just more settings. If that alone happens, I''ll update this
      review. But until then, this game is just a very interesting and creative idea
      that didn''t know its footing.'
