    review: "Let's chalk this one up to a maybe. I find it hard to give a music resource\
      \ pack a negative review because not only am I not knowledgable in music in\
      \ the slightest, but I also think each pack can leave an entirely different\
      \ impression on you based on how useful the songs in it are at the time of you\
      \ purchasing it. \n\nMy issue with this particular pack is that I found a lot\
      \ of the tracks to be somewhat generic sounding, like you can find nearly identical\
      \ ones for free online. There's two or three songs from this I thought were\
      \ pretty great and useful but the rest kind of just feel like a speck of dust\
      \ on an old windowsill.\n\nIn the end, I think it's highly subjective how useful\
      \ The Music Box: Japanese Horror will be to you, but I can say that it might\
      \ be a bit too pricey for what you get if you pay full price for it, especially\
      \ since there are many similar sounding tunes you can find for free online.\
      \ The same applies to the sound effects and ambient sounds, by the way. I guess\
      \ the MEs are kinda cool. There are certainly horror music packs for rpg maker\
      \ I can recommend over this one, but if you already have all the others and\
      \ you're still looking for more then it's not a bad purchase by any means."
