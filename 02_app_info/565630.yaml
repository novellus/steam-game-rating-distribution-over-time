    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Christmas Eve: Midnight''s Call" Collector''s Edition is an Hidden Object Puzzle
      Adventure game. The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and published by Big
      Fish Games Studio.


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its'' counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced;
      Hard and Custom.


      The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and
      clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly, It also indicates that there are tasks that can
      be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive map is not
      automatically given at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that available to lock the inventory panel in place
      to make it stationary,


      There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Shadow items; Pair items;
      Fragments items; Find ''x'' amount items; Traditional word lists. Some of these
      hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section
      as well.


      There is a collectible in the game: Christmas Presents. They are scattered throughout
      the game for the player to find.


      There is a bonus chapter in the game. But it can be accessed only after the
      main story is completed.


      There are thirteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes;
      Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Wallpapers; Screen Saver; Cinematic
      Scenes and Game''s Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed
      only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
