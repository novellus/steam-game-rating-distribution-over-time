    about_the_game: 'You are hired by a local grocery store in a newly developed seaside
      town to do deliveries and run errands mostly on a fully functional motorized
      Scooter. <br>You will be asked to complete jobs such as gathering fruits up
      a tree to bring back to the store, climbing a mountain to feed an animal, to
      simply throwing magazines at the doorstep of local stores/residents. No two
      jobs are the same but they all involve a delivery. Expect to ride through town
      traffic, climb the mountain range, enter buildings, interact with animals and/or
      people, hop on/off the Scooter and more all while listening to public radio.
      This is just the beginning of your new life in VR. This experience is tailored
      to those who enjoy driving, the open road and the radio while doing simple deliveries
      in a living environment. You are shown what to do in brief video messages, there

    review: This game is fun and relaxing to play. At first I was a bit worried I
      would get sick driving around on the scooter, but that hasn't been a problem.
      There is no time limit to complete tasks, so I'm able to explore the town as
      much as I want. The animals and locals help bring the town to life.  Would be
      cool if I could visit the local pizza shop for a slice and gas up my bike also.
      This game has a lot of potential. The town is small, but the mountain region
      and beach fronts are large. Hope to see more uses of the beach, maybe a paddle
      board lol.
