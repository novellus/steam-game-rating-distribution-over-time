    review: Sorry, loved the concept, but the execution is lacking.  Menu is finicky,
      graphics are jittery, and I spent more time trying to get the correct solution
      to register than I did finding the solution in the first place.  If an update
      fixes performances, and allows puzzle solutions to be entered more consistently,
      I will update my review.
