For those who don't know the odd looking sun thing is from the banner of the Order of the Blazing Sun, and armour of said Order does include the gorget/throat guard and large feathers. It does somewhat pair with the 'Order of the Brazen Shield' armour, but the colours don't match fully. Also, still a fair bit of money to pay for only a helmet, considering for a bit more you can buy a new class (but have to pay extra for challenge unlocks XD).
