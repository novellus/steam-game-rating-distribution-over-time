    review: This game always keeps me coming back. i haven't finished games 2-3 but
      once i tried 5, the format and ability to play on my ultra wide screen really
      has me hooked. i've never been an easy difficulty fan, but taking away much
      of the challenge somehow makes me appreciate this game much more for what it
      is.
