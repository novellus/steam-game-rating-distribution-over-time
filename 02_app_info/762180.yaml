    review: "My arm is tired from holding down the button to make the endless ENDLESS\
      \ endless boring (and stupid) dialog go, line by line by line... press S to\
      \ start, press S to end, press S to block, press S some more,  press S to read,\
      \ press S again, press S and press S and press S S S and sometimes press A,\
      \ but usually press S over and over and over. What a boring piece of junk. I\
      \ wish I hadn't wasted an entire ten dollars on it. \n"
