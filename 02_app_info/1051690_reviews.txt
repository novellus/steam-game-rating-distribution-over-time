Because of this, I feel like I never really get sucked into games that rely on the Nostalgia factor like Dusk or Amid Evil. I enjoyed both of those games, but the entire time I felt as if I was supposed to be reliving the \"glory days\" of gaming which I never experienced in the first place. \n\nSo with this in mind, let me tell you in no uncertain terms that nightmare reaper KICKS ASS. It has that retro run and gun high-speed chaos that you find in these throwback games but thats just the base of this delicious cake. The wild variety of weapons, upgrades, maps, secrets and enemies all add to this incredibly addictive experience thats not quite a roguelite and not quite a retro shooter. I really cannot put into words why this game gives me so much joy. Maybe its the feeling that naturally arises when the game offers a weapon thats essentailly a pokeball so you can capture enemies and summon them later to do your bidding. Maybe its the explosions of pixel blood and money that happen when you blast a zombie in the head with a super shotgun. Or maybe its just the fact that there are no real flaws in this game expect for its \"unfinished\" nature. I put that in quotes becasue while this game is still in early access, theres a solid 20-30 hours of awesome gameplay already packed in here.\n\nBut this game. If you are unsure, put it on your wishlist and grab it next time it goes 25% off. I cant think of any demographic who wouldnt have a BLAST playing this unless you are wholly against shooting games. The dev team raised the bar on this one.","timestamp_created":1610048444,"timestamp_updated":1610048444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5rKX7/YCedetwQI="}
