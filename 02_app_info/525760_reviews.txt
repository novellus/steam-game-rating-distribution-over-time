The challenges ramp up after each level. I did almost get stuck on one of the beginning levels (1-3) but I managed to figure out how to do that last jump swing. That's really my main gripe with the game as it never quite explains how to do these swinging jumps. The last jump from the grip to launch yourself to the finish line is quite large. I basically did a hammer down arm motion from the very top and let go to get this challenge completed.\n\nAlso, I was able to reach the bars that were sometimes far from each other. But a person who has small arms may not be able to reach and have to jump swing a lot more and in some places that are not intended. The game ran smoothly. I had no problems as far as the game recognizing where I was trying to grab. Grab areas within objects seemed pretty generous.\n\nOn the Oculus, you move by clicking down on the joysticks and swinging your arms. You go in the direction they are facing. There was some minor clipping issues on walls at times, but it's not as bad as the negative reviews would have you believe. This is a good game, better than most other obstacle challenge VR games. The challenges are well designed.\n\nAll your obstacle finishes are timed. You can get gold, silver, of bronze if you beat the challenge within the alloted time frames. There's global leadersboards. You unlock more levels by beating the current obstacle challenge. \n\nRate 7/10.
