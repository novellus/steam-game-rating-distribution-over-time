    review: This could have been a fantastic game. The guns work well, the reloading
      is perfect, the wild west setting is nicely done...BUT... I bought this because
      I wanted to relive the Clint Eastwood gunfights against one, two or more players.
      It seems to offer this in the 'Defend The Town' option...BUT...IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
      TO LOSE A GUNFIGHT, even against 3 GUNFIGHTERS. In 32 separate waves I encountered
      1, 2, or 3 baddies in each case. But in every case they took at least 3 seconds
      to fire even a single shot shot, giving me more than enough time to fire as
      many bullets as I wanted. Even worse, when they do eventually start shooting,
      not a single shot is on target. Not one. Even if I fire my bullets at the ground
      or refuse to fire at all, I did not get shot once in over 30 waves. It's inexplicable,
      but there it is. It looked like someone had finally created a viable gunfighting
      game, but with no possibility of getting shot, what's the point?
