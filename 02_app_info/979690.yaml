      /><br>Welcome to The Ascent Group arcology, a self-contained corporate-run metropolis,
      stretching high into the sky and filled with creatures from all over the galaxy.
      <br><br>You play as a worker, enslaved by the company that owns you and everyone
      else in your district. One day, whilst sent on a routine assignment to make
      use of your skills with a cyberdeck, you are suddenly caught in a vortex of
      catastrophic events. The Ascent Group, the largest mega corporation on the planet,
      shuts down for unknown reasons, causing the automated security systems to go
      haywire. <br><br>The survival of your district is threatened: rival corporations
      are trying to force appropriation and crime syndicates are looking to boost
      their black-market augmentation trade. You must take up arms to stop them from
      seizing control and embark on a new mission to find out what started it all.
