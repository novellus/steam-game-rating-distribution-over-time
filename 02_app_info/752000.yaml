    review: '[h1]Very simple shoot ''em up / repeating boss battle game.[/h1]


      Let''s begin with a positive note. Four words of praise:


      [list]

      [*]No bugs. (in technical sense)

      [*]The realistic bugs (in the literal sense) look cool.

      [*]Music choices are okay.

      [*]The boss battle is an alright concept.

      [/list]


      I think this game could be a decent, albeit repetitive, fun for little children.


      [h1]But...[/h1]


      It is a very simple game. There''s no story, just shooting bugs for its sake.
      Except butteflies and ladybugs because they''re cute (you lose points for that).


      There are three weapons: a close-range flamethrower, and two long-range shooty
      reskins/guns with a different sound effect and slight difference in damage.


      All 30 levels have different backgrounds and bugs. That''s cool. However, there''s
      a problem:


      [h1]Every level plays the exact same way[/h1]


      Unfortunately, I was bored after 5 minutes of playing, realizing it would not
      change or get more challenging, only more tedious. I would have quit early,
      were it not for wanting to beat it for all achievements.


      In each level a boss bug spawns downward zig-zagging little bugs. Killing them
      nets points, and their touch reduces your life (but it regenerates fast).


      [h1]Always the same boss battle[/h1]


      The boss is initially indestructible but once you''ve killed enough of its spawn,
      it becomes vulnerable.


      The boss AI walks back and forth and seems to have a rudimentary survival sense,
      as it sometimes turns around avoid your gun shots. So you have to chase or ambush
      it. Fine, but another problem:


      Boss health and the # of killed spawn required to make them vulnerable scales
      by level.


      It''s the ultimate boring choice of game design: instead of introducing new
      tactics, more attack patterns, unlocks, or other interesting stuff to keep things
      fresh, the boss just becomes tankier.


      [h1]Several other qualms[/h1]


      Note that you can''t remap keys. There''s no controller support.


      Also, when you kill a butterfly (accidentally or not), there''s this panicked
      or condescending voice telling "don''t kill the butterflies/ladybugs". I mean,
      it''s effective but heck is it annoying. And those cute bugs are always in the
      way, the bullet-to-bug hit boxes being very generous.


      Some of the backgrounds are rather obnoxious - while they fit the environment
      of the insect in question, they just aren''t nice to look at.


      As the final issue, if you wish to beat the game you have to do it in one session
      - there seems to be no saving and it always restarts from level 1.


      [h1]End note: Simply tedious[/h1]


      Through sheer willpower (powered by my will to 100% the game) I persisted through
      and beat the game. It took 75 long minutes.


      The game basics are fine: I didn''t manage to crash the game once during the
      play, and the boss mechanic would be okay were it not the sole one. Game just
      needs more varied boss fights. I mean, the attack pattern that fits a black
      ant doesn''t necessarily fit a beetle.


      [h1]Due to its repetitive content, I''d recommend getting it on sale. I feel
      it''s worth less than $1.[/h1]
