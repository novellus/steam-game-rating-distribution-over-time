    review: I'm a big fan of other Wolverine titles, but this was very disappointing.  The
      stability of the game is, quite simply, unacceptable.  I bought it this week.  Played
      about 10 hours.  Uninstalled today.  Constant crashes.  Look at Gary's other
      fine titles.  I regret this purchase.
