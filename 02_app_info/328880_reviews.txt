Why are they not intertwined then this is for you.  The game is very strange to say the least but it was compelling and i enjoyed the ride.  As far as these types of games go it was not frustratingly difficult, but i'd put it slightly above the average but don't let that scare you. The art was very nice, and the areas pleasant. \n\nOver all thumbs up if your into hidden object adventures  and want to try something unique.","timestamp_created":1604963821,"timestamp_updated":1604963821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43IzT1/UCcLi4rQI="}
