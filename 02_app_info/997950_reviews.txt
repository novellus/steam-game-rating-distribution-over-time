Purple Helmeted Love Warriors, anyone?Sure, why not? \n\nIn other words, if a developer doesn't take a basic step such as this to maintain game integrity and with consideration of its player base,  how much time do you think they have and will spend putting a decent game forward? \n\nI changed half my original review three times today, and all within fifteen minutes. Take five to fix that garbage, developer.","timestamp_created":1585549533,"timestamp_updated":1590316527,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.409840553998947144","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Y2Qo/ICdd2n/AE="}
