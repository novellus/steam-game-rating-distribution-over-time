      will encounter various flaws. The game is almost completely redesigned and improved,
      and the new version will be available in January 2021. You can purchase the
      game now if you want to support the project and our small independent development
      team. Thank you for believing in us!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1002020/extras/interpoint-gameplay.gif?t=1609252082"
