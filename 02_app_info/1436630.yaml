      work or hire someone to work; when they buy a car or milk at a supermarket.
      You are the head of a corporation, and you decide what taxes you will be paid.<br>You
      can also expand your &quot;corporation&quot; to neighboring countries. Joining

      your economy and trade, and join the neighboring countries. In addition, you
      have plenty of tools available to you to manage your domestic policies. You
      need to think ahead and take control of the &quot;employees of the corporation&quot;

      the country. You don't pay them a salary - they will pay you themselves. You
      manage taxes and collect them.
