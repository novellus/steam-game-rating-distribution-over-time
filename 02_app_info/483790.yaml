    short_description: Fast forward two years to the future and see how life has changed
      for you and Tatsuya. While you've never been more in love, you're not quite
      as far along in the relationship as you'd hoped. After a romantic date though,
      your life changes forever. Can an old threat bring promises of a new, brighter
      future?

    review: 'This game is one of the best I''ve found in a while and I wholeheartedly
      recommend it to anyone who enjoys visual novels and otome games. There are not
      enough around in my opinion and this one is worth the investment of money and
      time. I adore the characters and the hugely complex world of this game, it pulls
      on the heart-strings and leaves you wanting more.


      Tatsuya wasn''t my favourite love interest but his route was still wonderful,
      and he is a lot hotter and a lot less tsundere in his epilogue. I really enjoyed
      getting to spend time with him and see what happened after all the drama. To
      get a glimpse of the happily ever after <3'
