      \ your golf (yes, golf) skills with your surely honed FPS talents to create\
      \ a title that is borderline insanity\u2026in a good way!  When I asked the\
      \ creator of how this odd combo of golf/FPS came about, he told me he was hitting\
      \ the links and had a simple thought- \u201CWhat if Vikings invaded the course\
      \ right now?\u201D Yeah, I was sold after hearing that too.\u201D<br />\r\n\
