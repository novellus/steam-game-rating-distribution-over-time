Exactly what you think it is, though unfortunately lacks any content relating to the Drowned Past expansion update.\n\n[b]The Art of Seven: The Days Long Gone[/b]\nIn my opinion the main reason to buy this. As mentioned before it doesn't include any artwork for the Drowned Past section of the game which is unfortunate but does include a few concepts that never made it into the game which, at least for me, are very interesting. Some artwork is coupled with developer/artist commentary which gives some nice insight into the design process behind the game. Store page states that it contains every piece from the development process but I'm not entirely sure that's true. Overall still pretty interesting.\n\n[b]Guidebook[/b]\nThis is where it starts to fall apart, the guidebook [i]only[/i] includes basic control information (no info on some of the advanced movement/combat mechanics or any mechanical information whatsoever really) and a how-to for every quest though they lack expected info like what rewards each quest gives. Once again lacking the Drowned Past content. That's it, doesn't include any other information like where to find all upgrades or even a guide on the many unique weapons that can be found, a very sub-par guidebook.\n\n[b]The Island of Peh Map[/b]\nAbsolutely pointless, unless you really want a map of Peh as your desktop wallpaper.","timestamp_created":1593891360,"timestamp_updated":1593891360,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553718984127044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0IHVjfMCevfokgI="}
