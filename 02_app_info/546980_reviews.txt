Artwork that both would need more quality and quantity, story to do nothing but bore you, and to top it all; spelling errors o' plenty, just to suck out what little value this game could have. \n\nVerdict: Don't buy. Not even ironically. You're better off just buying its trading cards instead of getting them from the game if you just want the XP.
