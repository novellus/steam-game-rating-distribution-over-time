    review: 'This was a great find among some slightly older games. I thoroughly enjoyed
      playing it, and recommend adding it to your HOPA library.  I wish more games
      could be like this. I note I''m biased toward historical and/or mythical settings.


      Pros:

      - smooth interface

      - lovely art (resolution may be a little grainy at times in cut scenes, but
      not bad)

      - good HO scenes (word lists with some items having an extra "step"; also silhouette
      HO puzzles)

      - an excellent variety of puzzles, ranging from easy to moderately challenging
      (no line tracing or similar annoyances)

      - a coherent story and sensible object placement; appropriate historical objects
      used

      - strong voice acting

      - in-game guide; that said, I never used it, which indicates a good game


      Neutral:

      - the alchemy mechanic/mini-game was good at first, but got tedious

      - no Steam achievements or trading cards; however, the in-game achievements
      were more interesting than usual

      - no indicator for collectibles (however, there is just one thing to collect,
      and it''s there in every location; I got them all in my first play-through without
      using the in-game guide)


      Cons:

      - almost all the HO scenes are used twice; this doesn''t bother me personally,
      but should be noted


      This was a 10/10 for me.
