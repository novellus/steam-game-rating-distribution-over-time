I honestly came into the game thinking it'd be a short game with not a lot to offer considering it's low price. I was happily surprised! The game was clear about most of the puzzles but still quite hard. I am very happy with this game and would have even paid more for it if I knew how fun, clear and challenging it was going to be.","timestamp_created":1578887122,"timestamp_updated":1578890912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513357818126678467","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkOzOzu8Cc+fV6wE="}
