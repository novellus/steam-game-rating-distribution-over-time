      was announced and was released before TF2. The gameplay and goals of each are

      similar to Team Fortress Classic and QuakeWorld Team Fortress than it is to
      Team Fortress 2.

    review: I've been playing team fortress back then when I was still a little younger
      and even today many years later fortress forever still manages to bring back
      old memories. I spend well over 4000hours on fortress forever so far (including
      presteam launch) and still enjoy every minute of playing the game!
