I can tell this was a work of love and hardship for the devs, this is really something you can appreciate from the small dev team that made it. I was never into speedrunning but this game just constantly is bringing me back and making me pull up livesplit to beat my times for each chapter, no there isn't a vast story, but for an indie game some of the puzzle had me stumped. The game has that vibe that makes you say one more time. The platform can be frustrating, but once you master it. Oh once you master it it's satisfying, I loved the movement of this game it even has a multitude of enemies the guns do seem underpowered and ammo feels like more of a utility than a weapon, enemies do seem to be placed to lengthen gameplay, but I found it fun figuring out how to manage to skip every enemy.  For 99 cents this game was truly a masterpiece. I loved every second of it.","timestamp_created":1594441251,"timestamp_updated":1594441251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i9eGnvMCcaW9lAI="}
