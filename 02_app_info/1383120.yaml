    review: 'This game probably takes greater inspiration from Lego Stunt Rally (2000)
      more than Micro Machines like it says on the store page. Even the pieces look
      similar. But I''d consider that a positive, the thumbs down is just because
      it''s a very very low content game right now with no single player offerings
      unless you count opening an online lobby and playing with bots. The UI is also
      very abstract as to cause confusion. Everything else is your-mileage-may-vary
      and probably comes off much better in a party environment that I can''t really
      test with no one to play it with, like the car physics and narrow roads causing
      a lot of crazy bumbling.


      What''s here isn''t done bad for its purpose but we''ll see if updates make
      it a fuller game.'
