    review: 'I already reviewed the base game, it''s great.

      Glass Masquerade 2: Illusions is just perfect.

      It improved upon the first game quite a lot.

      The visuals are once again: Simply beautiful.

      And it really just feels satisfying to play this.

      Even the DLC''s are once again worth a buy.

      Truly a perfect sequel in every single aspect.

      You can get 9 additional puzzles in this DLC.

      That was a somewhat big playtime booster.

      And therefore it''s definitely, really worth it.

      Onyx Lute created a truly fantastic sequel.

      I do have to give this DLC a positive review.

      For such a low price: It''s definitely worth it.'
