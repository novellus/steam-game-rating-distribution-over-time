    review: 'Shadow Man, has a supernatural horror story about a man named Michael
      LeRoi, who is the stories'' protagonist. Michael is able to transcend between
      a place of existence where there is life and an afterlife by ghostlike abilities.
      He is versed in matters of a spiritual nature. His task is to protect life from
      horrible characters that prey upon the the living from beyond this veil between
      life and death, by destroying these characters.


      To win, the protagonist must find a way through more than a dozen different
      regions. These regions are connected together. Initially, many of these places
      are inaccessible, and require the protagonist to obtain abilities or gear, which
      allow him access to new regions and previously inaccessible areas. The equipment
      and abilities may be found in a closely-knit maze-like world that these regions
      form together, and the more equipment and abilities that are found, the more
      places become reachable. This process of exploration and collecting, requires
      the protagonist to revisit these areas, and explore places after obtaining new
      equipment and abilities.

      Controlling the protagonist towards his final moment, requires making perilous
      leaps, running, climbing, and swimming, and a lot of shooting. He may also travel
      to regions instantly, and progress may be saved at any time.

      The labyrinth contains horrible adversaries, which the protagonist should neutralize.
      He aims at them automatically, and the viewing-angle on the protagonist is maintained
      automatically as well, or may be manually adjusted, but generally this is not
      required. Adversaries may be neutralized in a terrible way, or by using an attack
      which allows the protagonist to obtain some of his adversaries'' health after
      neutralizing them. Eventually, and after leaving a region, adversaries reappear.


      The labyrinth is complex and forms the main obstacle to overcome. The further
      the protagonist goes into the labyrinth, the less hope there is to ever find
      a way out of the endurance. Finding a way through the labyrinth requires concentration,
      and is a daunting task that demands persistence, perseverance, and a sense of
      direction.

      The abilities and gear the protagonist obtains are visible when they are equipped.
      Most equipment he may hold in his hands, and abilities are presented as markings
      that are drawn on his body, which grant him supernatural abilities. His abilities
      and equipment are inspired by mysticism and historical lore, and seem authentic.
      Some equipment consume ammunition, and may be supplemented by destroying containers,
      which also reappear after leaving a region.

      The environments use architecture that is often organic or natural in design,
      and shows interiors of buildings as well. Most of these environments are horrible
      places. Navigating the labyrinth is a disorienting experience. The labyrinth
      has many secrets, and making progress is generally resisted by having to reveal
      those secrets. The environments show horrible settings with dark themes. Technically,
      the environments a well rendered, with various geometrical shapes, with almost
      no gaps in the geometry. The protagonist may carry a torch, and the environments
      may show dynamic lighting effects.

      Various music plays, depending on where the protagonist is, and sounds are used
      to a high degree to set the atmosphere. Sound effects are appropriate. For instance,
      the sound footsteps generate, is based on the material the protagonist stands
      on. Sounds are also used in a way, where they may convey a terrible notion,
      a dark idea, or a horrible concept.
