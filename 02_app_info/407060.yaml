    reviews: "\u201CYesterday night I went to a party at a VR apartment in the sky\
      \ where we played music from YouTube, sang karaoke, someone played a virtual\
      \ piano, and we were all robots. The future is strange and amazing!\u201D<br><a\

      All of this works so well that I honestly had no way of telling who was in the\
      \ office next to me and who was in another city altogether. Above all else,\
      \ it pervades the sense of presence that all virtual reality experiences so\
      \ desperately try to capture.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dd-in-virtual-reality-is-better-than-the-real-thing\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >David Jagneaux, Motherboard</a><br><br>\u201C\
      A clever combination of head-tracking and spatial audio invited me to look directly\
      \ at other players when they spoke. It felt comfortable. Natural. Easy. Before\
      \ long, I started to forget about the odd combination of robots and taverns\
      \ and started to just enjoy hanging out with other people in VR.\u201D<br><a\
