    review: "Party Hard \xE9 um jogo viciante, uma trilha sonora muito boa e os gr\xE1\
      ficos s\xE3o lindinhos. E a cada festa que voc\xEA tem que dar um \"jeito\"\
      \ para acabar, tu tem que criar novas estrat\xE9gias de como passar, portanto\
      \ fica mais dif\xEDcil. \nEnfim, \xE9 um \xF3timo jogo!"
