The best part of Iridium is the feel. The momentum of the ship is spot on and fits perfect with the turning mechanic of facing left or right. This is where the game really excels, especially because the trance/techno tunes match so well with what's going on screen. It's bullet hell, and tense, but there's also a chill aspect to playing Iridium. There's a flow to the game that is hard to describe. All I can say is it works. If you're on the fence, I say purchase it. Iridium is unique, and stands apart from other shoot 'em ups, while also having a great arcade feel.","timestamp_created":1606605542,"timestamp_updated":1606701973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44M+5i/YCc/HptAI="}
