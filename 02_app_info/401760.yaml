    review: 'It''s a very tactical game where the focus is on the gameplay. The gameplay
      is very fun and I really liked the game. It''s a strategy game with a very uncommon
      gameplay.


      Although I enjoyed playing the game there are multiple things which could have
      been better:

      * More balanced levels: Some are very easy and some are very hard

      * Less escort missions: There are far too many missions where some ships have
      to be defended

      * Move-Commands for the ships to escort: They simply stay in place although
      many ships are approaching it

      * More focus on the characters: Although there is a rather nice main story,
      the characters involved are not relevant or interesting at all

      * Replayability of some levels: After beating the game it would be nice to see
      if some level was skipped or to have the option to retry a specific level to
      try another tactic or to try it on the harder difficulty level

      * More distinctive ship-models: It''s very hard to see if something is a mine-layer,
      a bomber, an artillery or just a simple fighter'
