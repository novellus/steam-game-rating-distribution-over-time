First off, It understands what it's trying to achieve, and it does it quite well. The Graphics are reasonably basic, but this is the type of game that doesn't require magnanimous visuals or textures.\n\nWhat you essentially have is a choose-your-own-adventure game where you're a Roman citizen who's conscripted into a newly formed legion during the second Punic war with Carthage. I'd say approximately half your time is spent choosing how you spend your time in camp, training with your sword and shield, socializing with your fellow legionaries, earning the trust and respect of your Centurion by volunteering for extra shifts of guard duty, which affects your stats and leads to many different opportunities throughout the story. Then the more significant battles begin, and you go through a series of turn based fights that, in my own opinion, are a real strong point of the game. First off, unlike the stereotypical RPG experience, even though they're generally small fights, you do feel like you're part of a much larger battle. You might be one-on-one with an enemy of the republic, and the game will say, \"Hey, the battle is about to shift, so you might not be fighting this guy much longer.\" Then you can decide whether to go full offensive and try to finish him off and gain all the glory that entails, or merely choosing whether your situation calls for staying back and trying to survive. It truly does make you feel like a small cog in a much more giant wheel.\n\nThere are lots of options in combat too, and they aren't just there for fun. Managing your health to keep yourself from dying is one thing, but you also have to maintain a sharp eye on your legionnaire's balance and stamina; the same goes for those you're facing in combat. You're also given different methods on how to manage those things. I have encountered many enemies that committing all of my legionaries energy into attacking them relentlessly was pointless. Better to feint and try to throw them off balance first. In that regard, one thing that greatly impressed me was how exemplary the game is at giving the player information I needed when I needed it. There isn't always a transparent difference between what you should or shouldn't decide, which only adds to why this game is excellent; I've played games that offered you nine different choices, but only one of them made genuine sense, and what's the point to that? Sometimes, you can just be choosing between shades of gray. But I found that it was always pretty easy to understand what the implications were of my choices, and that's not easy for a developer to pull off.\n\nFrom a story point of view, the choices are interesting, and I think the best way to explain them will be by summing up how my first playthrough ended. The overall campaign was going well, we outnumbered Carthage, and we're poised to strike and crush them once and for all. My legionnaire had been recently promoted, doing well, and I probably could have chosen a more cautious playstyle for this battle and not doing anything overly bold. After all, Rome was going to win the war regardless. So I'm there on the battlefield, and with a text event, the game tells me I'm in the shield line when I see witness skirmishers attempting to retreat and are about to and be run down. The game didn't complicate my choices. I could stay in the shield line like a good legionnaire or break formation and attempt to help them. It would've been obvious what to do in a real-world scenario; in gaming, where you're usually the \"Mighty Hero,\" it almost always makes sense to take the more \"Heroic\" approach. My instincts told me to do the \"Heroic\" option, but I had had some success recently acting like a hero, so I chose that option. Well, I quickly found myself in a one sided battle against three formidable enemies. I held my own and killed one thinking maybe I could survive this, but once a new foe almost immediately entered to replaced him, I knew I was to suffer the consequences of my actions. I decided to pull an Iceman and adopted a  defensive strategy, hoping that if I could hold on long enough, the game might tell me that my cohort was rushing in to save me; events like that happen too, but it was not to be. I was Overwhelmed and died soon after, game over, and this Centurion bled out on a field somewhere in Africa dreaming of the home he might one day return to during that battle.\n\nWhat's genuinely interesting is, I didn't feel cheated by that. I had made the decision, even though I knew it was risky. I have done things like that before and barely survived the day; knowing that you really can die adds real weight to your choices. In retrospect, it seemed like the right end to that particular soldier's career. A well fought life, in my opinion.\n\nI Absolutely recommend 9/10.","timestamp_created":1610085854,"timestamp_updated":1610085854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws42m8PYCeee7wQI="}
