    review: "The game has nice visuals and very interesting VFX, the combat is more\
      \ or less entertaining but it gets repetitive very easily, I liked the story\
      \ but I agree it's not for everyone (it has some nice twists)\n\nPros:\n- Visually\
      \ pleasing\n- Entertaining story (in my opinion)\n- Good but simple combat system\n\
      - There is a build for every playstile\n- Simple mechanics \n\nCons:\n- Combat\
      \ gets repetitibe \n- Very grindy to the late game\n- A lot of useless elements\n\
      - Control compatibility is complete crap, no control completely works out of\
      \ the bat (you need a 3rd party patch/mod to fix it, search in the community\
      \ discussions)\n- (For the 100%) Many achievements are tied to RNG\n\nTLDR:\
      \ I slightly recomend it just for the interesting story and the nice visuals,\
      \ the control support fuck up I can look past (shitty port) though the combat\
      \ gets a bit repetitive on the late game and post game\n\nScores:\nVisuals:\
      \ 7/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nStory: 8/10\nControls: 3/10\nMusic: 6/10\nOverall Score:\
      \ 6/10"
