    review: 'Reviews are kinda bogus.  Probably from back when people thought there
      would be something better.


      Resolution can be made sharper with UE4 fix.

      Yes there''s a bit of aim assist even on all star but you still have to focus
      and aim and it feels correct when you make a shot.


      If you like MLB Home Run Derby VR, this is the basketball version of that.


      Good add to the fitness lineup if you can get it on sale.


      Update:. This is turning out to be one of my favorite VR games.  Worth it even
      at full price!'
