    about_the_game: 'Russell Stone is a Jewish Rabbi at a poor synagogue in New York
      City. He is a devout man with a problem. Membership is way down and he lacks
      the funds to keep his synagogue open. Things are looking very bleak, and he
      has grown progressively more cynical and bitter with the passage of time.<br
      />

      <br />

      Just as he is on the verge of packing it all in, he receives some interesting
      news. A former member of his congregation has died and left the Rabbi a significant
      amount of money. A blessing? Or the start of something far more sinister? Can
      Rabbi Stone just accept the money and move on? His conscience says no. Step
      into his shoes as he travels all over Manhattan in his attempt to uncover the
      truth.<br />

      <br />

      Features rabbinical conversation methods, a unique method of fighting, an original
      score, and three different endings!'

    review: Maybe it's my fault for going in with wrong expectations but as a fan
      of Blackwell franchise having this game be this short and straight forward as
      this. I could've easily bought this game, finished it, maybe even completed
      all achievements and refunded it. Short games are not bad on it's face but there
      clearly is more to this story that could be explored. This is what I woudl've
      expected from a demo of a full fledged Shivah game. It still has some nice puzzles
      but ultimately I am disappointed. I instead recommend Blackwell games or charnel
      house trilogy or Kathy rain. It's just sadly a disappointment for me.
