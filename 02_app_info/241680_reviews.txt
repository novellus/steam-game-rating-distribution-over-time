Before you decide not to use this software based on the reviews please download the trial and try it out for yourself as many problems may be fixed.[/b]\n\n[i]Before you buy this, check out the free trial on the Actual Multiple Monitors website: [/i]\nhttp://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/\n\nReally useful piece of software to use if you have 2 monitors. It combines a lot of useful features such as allowing you to do stuff on your second monitor when you’re in a game in your first monitor without it minimizing and having hotkeys which allow you to arrange your windows.\n\nThe UI isn't all that great but it has some features which it's competitor Display Fusion doesn’t have such as the option to have new windows open in the display which your cursor is in (which I really miss)\n \nIt’s a really good application and if you have 2 or more monitors you should give it a try.\nIt also works with start button mods for Win 8, such as Start8.\n\nI no longer use AMM as it doesn’t work with WIN 10 but if it did then I wouldn't have switched to Display Fusion.\n\nFeel free to message me on Steam if you have any questions about this program\n\nIf you are looking for a multiple monitor program for Windows 10 then I recommend Display Fusion, you can find it on Steam.","timestamp_created":1445079080,"timestamp_updated":1538904315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637788772583007813","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x4r2puYCdbHURg=="}
