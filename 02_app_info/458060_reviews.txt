He actually made his 'sad ending' a middle finger to his critics, abandoning his audience.\n\nAfter that? I see no further point of addressing it on any other level than a slowly winding middle finger. Nothing but dull, dross, followed by a middle finger and crying laughing emojis, in terms of content.\n\nTrash game, trash dev, not even worth a pity purchase.","timestamp_created":1592868102,"timestamp_updated":1592868102,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw98uV7/ICcObMjwI="}
