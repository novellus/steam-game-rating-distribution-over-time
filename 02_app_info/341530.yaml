    about_the_game: Get your friends and bust out the controllers, STARDUST VANGUARDS
      is a local four-player dueling game inspired by old-school anime space operas,
      combining arcade-style battling with the ability to summon your own NPC army
      as support!<br><br>Each battle is unique with the game's random event system,
      forcing players to respond to dozens of potential surprise attacks by computer-controlled
      space pirates. The pirates can even win the whole battle themselves so perhaps
      a temporary truce is in order? STARDUST VANGUARDS brings fast-paced dueling,
      a dash of strategy, and plenty of bullets to competitive couch-multiplayer fans.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Lightning-fast local (shared
      screen) multiplayer dueling that rewards precision<br></li><li> Summon reinforcements
