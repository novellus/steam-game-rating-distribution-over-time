    about_the_game: 'For the first time in over 20 years, we are heralding the return
      of a much loved piece of gaming history with the classic RPG, Wasteland!  <br><br>Mutants.
      Again. Even more than there were last time: they seem to materialize out of
      the very grains of the radioactive desert sand. Venomous yellow eyes. The black
      gunmetal glint of Uzis as they close in for the kill. There''s nowhere to run,
      and nothing to rely on but your MAC 17 machine gun. What a way to save the human
      race.<br><br>The year is 2087, eighty-nine years after an all out nuclear war
      between the United States and the Soviet Union turned vast swaths of the Earth
      into a hellish wasteland where survival is a daily struggle against thirst,
      hunger, radiation sickness, ravaging raiders, and mutants - always mutants.
      You are a Desert Ranger, one of a band of stalwart lawmen born from the remnants
      of a U.S. Army detachment who survived the nuclear holocaust by holing up in
      a maximum security prison. You may wear ragtag uniforms and carry make-shift
      weapons, but the Desert Rangers are the only law left in what was once the American
      southwest.  <br><br>Now something more secretive and sinister than the usual
      roving bands of mutants and raiders is menacing humanity, and it''s your job
      to investigate. Recruit the help you need, follow any leads you find, but beware.
      The wasteland is lawless desert and a lonely place, and the choices you make
      will shape the world around you. Better choose wisely. Your life depends on

    review: "Klassiker des CRPG Genres. Fans von Fallout oder den neueren Wasteland\
      \ Teilen sollten sich dieses Spiel unbedingt mal ansehen. Man sollte einfach\
      \ im Kopf behalten, dass es sich dabei um ein Spiel von 1988 handelt und man\
      \ keine zu hohen Erwartung bez\xFCglich der Grafik, Steuerung, etc. hat."
