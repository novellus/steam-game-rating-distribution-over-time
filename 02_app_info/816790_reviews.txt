The new trucks are quite cool and the D-538 can self load logs. Note that the D-538 doesn't always spawn, so starting with a c-class truck will make it much easier. There are also some C-65115s you can use, but those struggle though every inch of mud. If you want a casual experience, spawn with the 538 and it's no problem. If you want a hellride, try using the starting trucks. 7/10 would log again","timestamp_created":1591237261,"timestamp_updated":1591237261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47LbIvvICfpeFjAI="}
