    review: "This wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't necessarily good one either. This\
      \ looks like a high school project that could've gone through a bit more polishing\
      \ before attempting to sell it. Here's some good and some bad points that I've\
      \ experienced while playing:\n\nPros: \n* Art is pleasant on the eyes\n* Gameplay\
      \ is simple and easy to understand\n* Overall balance is spot on\n* Story is\
      \ unique and intriguing\n\nCons:\n* Not enough character interactions! I'd like\
      \ to see more between this odd party of people. Perhaps make inns/rest points\
      \ have little cut scenes periodically when resting at one.\n* Too much grinding.\
      \ Yes, i get you want the characters to be ready for the big bad but that's\
      \ literally all that makes up the game play. Fight after fight after fight.\
      \ It gets tedious, boring, and annoying.\n* Exploration is very limited. There\
      \ aren't many npcs to interact with, nor puzzles, nor lore. I want more adventure!\
      \ I want more dialog! I want to know more about this world!"
