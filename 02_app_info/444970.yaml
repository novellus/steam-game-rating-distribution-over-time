    about_the_game: "<strong>The Spatial Sound Card (SSC) software </strong>is a so-called\
      \ binaural audio application for headphones by New Audio Technology. Applications\
      \ are <strong>audio and video production, playing games, watching film, listening\
      \ music and VR/360.</strong><br><br>Binaural audio simulates on regular stereo\
      \ headphones the psychoacoustical phenomenons our brain uses in reality, to\
      \ localize audio sources around us and detect the size and kind of the room\
      \ environment where we're in. These psychoacoustical phenomenons called HRTF\
      \ = head-related transfer functions.<br><br>Using these HRTFs, the SSC provides\
      \ stereo and surround sound on virtual loudspeaker systems for any computer\
      \ using regular headphones, also giving the choice between surround sound 5.1,\
      \ 6.1 and 7.1.<br><br>Adapted from the professional production line, it is a\
      \ software-based, virtual sound card, highly recommended not only for gamers\
      \ but also for movie enthusiasts,  music lovers and for 360 / VR applications.<br><br>Differently\
      \ to other applications, the SSC <strong>doesn't do so-called up-mixing or fake-surround\
      \ processing</strong> what means to playback a stereo source on 5.1 or 7.1 anyway.\
      \ It provides <strong>straight away a natural and emotional listening experience</strong>\
      \ of stereo and surround sound with a <strong>very precise positional audio\
      \ reproduction</strong>. Just set the SSC e.g. to 5.1 and <strong>hear your\
      \ sources via the related loudspeaker configuration like stereo and 5.1.</strong><br><br>If\
      \ the SSC is running, it works as the standard audio device of your computer\
      \ between all audio playback applications and your audio hardware. <strong>The\
      \ loudspeaker virtualizations are taken from high-end music studios and film\
      \ mixing stages.</strong> The technology of the SSC has been used on Blu-ray\
      \ releases of well-known Hollywood blockbusters for more than 15 years.<br><br>To\
      \ <strong>customize the virtualizations</strong> to your preferences, the SSC\
      \ provides a lot of adjustable parameters like the room reflections of the virtual\
      \ sound studios and the frequency response curve of the headphones you use.\
      \ Profiles for some well-known headphone models are included*.<br><br>The SSC\
      \ works with all applications that support stereo and surround audio output.\
      \ These include games and media players like <strong>iTunes, Netflix and VLC</strong>\
      \ as well as the main output of your operating system. <br><br>Keep in mind,\
      \ that Windows sometimes struggle while dealing with new standard audio devices.\
      \ This is mostly just a setting issue. The user manual offers a lot of workarounds\
      \ which finally will let your SSC run pretty well.<br><br><br><i>*Headphone\
