    about_the_game: <strong>Cult of the Wind is a game about people who pretend to
      be airplanes. </strong><br><br><i>&quot;In an unknown time and place, a cult
      that worships the wreckage of ancient airplanes gathers to mimic the dogfights
      of old. With the peak of humanity far behind, their world is a mausoleum to
      a lush and verdant Art Deco past.&quot;</i><br><br>In Cult of the Wind, players
      compete and cooperate in ritualistic multi-player human dogfights, complete
      with imaginary weapons, pretend explosions, and airplane noises made with their
      mouths. Shower your friends in a hail of imaginary bullets and proclaim, &quot;I
      got you! You have to lie down,&quot; to which they respond, &quot;Nuh-uh, I
      have a shield.&quot; You argue about whether or not airplanes can have shields,
      meanwhile some other guy does a cannonball onto your head while whistling. It's
      great. <br><br>With an intuitive point-and-click level editor you'll be able
      to craft new levels or modify existing ones, then immediately share them with
      anyone on a server, even if you aren't the host. You can also craft a personalized
      appearance for your character with numerous articles of clothing and more. <br><br><ul
