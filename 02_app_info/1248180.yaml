    review: This is my review encompassing all the new legendary expansions - not
      just the base game - to quote a British phrase - it does exactly what it says
      on the tin - meaning that there are no new enemies - just quite simply, tougher
      and harder versions of the existing ones that we have already encountered  -
      for example in the early part of the game you may draw a dragon card with a
      strength of 15 -when your s and c have not yet grown-  it adds a new dimension
      to the game in that for example you will have to rethink your strategy as to
      whether you should risk going in the highlands and meeting a dragon you literally
      cannot beat until you have got yourself a flail from the city - there are many
      talisman players out there who have mastered the game but the legendary decks
      add a new degree of toughness - a new challenge for us talismaniacs
