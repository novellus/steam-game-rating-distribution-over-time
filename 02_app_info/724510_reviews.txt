I guess I can't say if it will resonate with everyone, but this is one of very, very few games that describe a system through playable mechanics in a way I can't put words to.\n\nIt resonates deeply with my own desire to analyze and systemically understand the world.\n\nI also enjoy the game; it's compelling enough and challenging and interesting; but it's not the joy of gameplay that brings me back to The Quiet Sleep, it's the way that through playing it and engaging with the gameplay brings me in tune to some indescribable perspective that I already recognize within myself. I feel seen.\n\nIf I could describe it with more precision, I would. I don't want to write a review this purple and indistinct any more than you want to read one. But there it is, the best I can do.","timestamp_created":1603239357,"timestamp_updated":1603239357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pOWgpPUCfp2TqQI="}
