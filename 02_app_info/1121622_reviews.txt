So why the thumbs down? Well, it ALWAYS starts in \"cold and dark\" and one has to do a number of things, some of which are not intuitive while sitting in the cockpit at the start of a runway (like remove wheel chocks and rope ties, wtf!). It really irritates the hell out of me when I have to do all these things every single time, when all I want to do is open the throttle and fly. \n\nIs it too much to ask to give us the option to start \"ready to fly\" JustFlight!? Seriously, why must I faff with your aircraft, when ALL the beautiful default aircraft I can simply jump in and go. If you want to be anal and annoying with your aircraft, then you have lost my support for your other products as well, which will presumably all be the same. Take care now, bye bye then.\n\n(Oh and stop being so greedy by only offering 25% discounts on sale. Everyone else is giving 50% plus. But that just shows how little regard you have for your customers, when your sale price for one aircraft is the same as the sale price of the whole complete Aerofly 2 base product, pathetic!)","timestamp_created":1604136906,"timestamp_updated":1604137972,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkt6Ev/UCeNGhqwI="}
