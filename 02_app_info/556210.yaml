    review: 'My early impressions of this plane and add on are highly favorable.  I
      think that it will be an excellent introduction and transition into twin engine
      flying.  This plane is or was apparently quite favored at flight schools for
      that very reason.  I have the autopilot working in its most basic and important  form
      using traditional FSX keyboard commands : Z turns off and on(no illumination
      seen), CTRL H (toggle) makes the heading bug active (AP panel light will illuminate)
      and CTRL Z (toggle) will enable altitude hold(panel switch illuminates).  I
      am not having luck yet with direct control of the AP panel switches, but the
      above takes care of the most pressing needs; others may have that more fully
      figured out.  I learned how to tailor the sound volumes since the engine was
      too loud for my taste - this is a big plus in a general way for all sustained
      flying now.   Also recommend downloading the manual from this page, I think
      it will be answering most of the questions that are coming up.  Since I am wanting
      to learn about actual flying protocols and flight models vs. trying to automate
      the process as much as possible, this looks like a great match for me.  Wonderful
      to experience the performance improvements of twin engine over singe engine
      planes if you are at that level of flight study.  Definitely an engaging plane
      and recommended from my side (also an affordable entry into twins), hope you
      find the same.


      PS From the manual I did later find the AP on/off switch, and it now illuminates
      the AP power switch properly; I anticipate this should enable full functioning
      of the AP.


      ********************************

      POSTSCRIPT JUL 03 2020:


      This remains my favorite plane in my flight training, vying for position with
      the Piper Comanche(a very hard plane to find, by the way - Eaglesoft Development
      Group has it).  There is an interesting evolution that has taken place in my
      acquistion of these two aircraft:


      I was ready to write a critical review on the Duchess as I had almost come to
      the point of abandoning it.  The problem was with the field of view.  I was
      never able to see sideways out of the cockpit when I had things set up for the
      front view without lots of hassles and adjustments while flying.  This was a
      critical flaw in the design of this airplane for me, or so I thought.  That
      led me to the Comanche, which does not have this problem.  The performance specs
      of these two planes are very similar, and hence my equal interest in both of
      them.


      At this point of abandonment of the Duchess, I decided to investigate any point
      of view adjustments that can be made within FSX.  THERE IS A GREAT AND SIMPLE
      SOLUTION here that has radically improved the use of FSX in all respects, so
      I wish to share it.  This is the link, offered by Steam no less:


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=367422210


      This has changed everything in FSX to the better, and now the Duchess is again
      at the top of my list.  I would highly recommend considering making this change
      in the config file for FSX.  It was a simple fix (I back up the original file
      just in case) and all aircraft are dramatically better now.  You can see properly
      for traffic pattern work and general  viewing and safety in flight.


      The Duchess and Comanche are two wonderful planes if you are involved with the
      flying of twins.  Still highly recommended, but CONDITIONAL upon setting the
      view to WideViewAspect=True per the link above.


      Incidentally, autopilot works fine in all respects once you learn where the
      switches for control are.


      Additional note : Learning how to control the zoom of the external view from
      the aircraft also becomes important here.  This is done with the + and - keys.  Combination
      of wide angle view and zoom factor will make a big difference with all aircraft,
      not just the Duchess.


      Best regards, CEC'
