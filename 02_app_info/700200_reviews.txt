Once you work out the formula each play is roughly the same (score really only depends on how fast you can click)\n\nSome issues to note/be improved : \n\n- You cant drag roads, each tile has to be placed 1 by 1\n- Scanline are enabled by default, not sure what this adds\n- The game needs a random map generator\n- There is no reason to build any park except the biggest one\n- It is unclear how far workers will travel to work\n- The UI is garbage, the game needs hotkeys/a better build menu\n- Please add some sort of data overlay/graph feature\n\nFor the price its a good hour of fun, but without some updates/extra content it isn't a game you would play twice\n\nHopefully in a few months and a few updates I can change this to a positive review!","timestamp_created":1605482888,"timestamp_updated":1605483859,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555125713348388672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w/GS5/UCfuXQrgI="}
