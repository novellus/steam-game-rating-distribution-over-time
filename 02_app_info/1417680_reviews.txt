Not bad... if this is a first project. I say go back to the drawing board and try again.\n\nThere were a lot things that weren't correct with this game. The environment was very minimalist and I felt like I was plunked down into Lego Land. Not very scary. \n\nThere was constant chase music on loop when nothing was chasing me. This contributed to the Lego Land feeling and sapped any fear I may have felt. \n\nFinding items wasn't always obvious and in some cases, they didn't spawn at all. Clues were sometimes really vague. \n\nI hope the Devs keep trying. Not every game is going to be a huge hit, and I get that. Hopefully they can take something positive from my criticism and use it to improve the next game. \n\nAnd at the risk of sounding harsher than I already do-- With all the Slendy clones out there, you really need to bring the thunder if you're going to add one to the pile. This ended up being pretty meh. Sorry, friends. \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609083074,"timestamp_updated":1609083074,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604541659355163574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3ea00vYCfuzkvQI="}
