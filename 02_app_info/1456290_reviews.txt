I was pretty exited as theres currently no \"super speed\" game on PC nor console. One day I was scrolling through tik tok and saw a video from the creator saying he decided to release the game on steam I was so exited, even though I wanted to get it the day it released I didn't have time until today. The game is pretty much what I was hoping for, It's still rough and is very much an early access. I'm not going to bother listing things I think should be implemented because im sure the developers heard the same requests too many times to count. I can't wait to see what this game turns into, if done right you could have one of the most unique games out there. Good luck and thank you for listening to the fans.","timestamp_created":1609818255,"timestamp_updated":1609818255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ46aWp6PYCeuPLwAI="}
