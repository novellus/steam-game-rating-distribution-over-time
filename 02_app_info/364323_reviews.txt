If you set a specific engine RPM and manifold air pressure, the engine of the DA40 should give you about the same performance, which is definitely not the case here. And this thing climbs like a rocket, which is also absolutely inaccurate.\n\nThe knobs and dials are horribly troublesome to use, and are not animated. If you're adjusting the VHF frequencies and you overshot by 0.25 hertz, guess what? You only can tune 1 way, so you gotta tune all the way to max and back to your desired frequency again. Some of the MFD displays are inaccurate with some information pages missing, which should NOT be the case in the actual Garmin G1000 avionics. \n\nSome switches in the cockpit are missing, such as the CABIN COOL and ALTERNATE AIR. The circuit breakers are not implemented as well. The ELT switch is slightly different, which should be the case on some models, but they did not include the ELT indicator lights.\n\nSo overall, this DLC is quite simplified in terms of the cockpit and flight mechanics. Not a passable representation of the real DA40. But FSX is an old simulator, so I'll let some of it slide.\n\nI just hope that they do not make this same mistake again in FS 2020, which I have high hopes for. And if they do release another DA40 for FS 2020, I'll be scrutinising it again,","timestamp_created":1597050197,"timestamp_updated":1597050197,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wILn6/MCcvrHmgI="}
