Instead of following the original Ded Inside, it followed the First Person game. This game seems to be more open and lots to explore comparing to the previous game where its more linear. Gameplay is almost the same. Instead of collecting coins like in the original, you collect items to craft vodkas, health, and a new type of vodka where it explodes and do more damage than regular vodka. Gameplay is fairly okay just like the prequel.\n\nYou will once again have to face demons, but in hell, and your weapon is vodka, as always.","timestamp_created":1609884099,"timestamp_updated":1609884099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m7yk6vYCdcbqwAI="}
