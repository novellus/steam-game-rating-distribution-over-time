Original game had promise, but never received an update.  Devs cut all communication at approximately 9 months.  There were multiple long silences from them, interspersed by hopeful \"working on it again\" messages, the last of which described a whole new game being built, new game engine, etc...We understood they were students, studying etc, but now its been about 6 months with zero communication.  Game is dead. Stay away.","timestamp_created":1538340988,"timestamp_updated":1570412063,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455341517925262451","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1538688186,"developer_response":"Hey there!\nWe are glad you like the game so far, we look forward to bringing you more content and updates!
