It has limited content, basic gameplay, and is unpolished overall. I honestly thought it was an Early Access game and had to look over the store page to verify that indeed it wasn't in Early Access. It has not received any updates in a long while. \n\nThis game is running on the Unity Engine. It ran fine on my 1060 GTX, running at a relatively steady 90 frames per second. The visuals lead you to believe there will be fun, voxel physics like there is in Paint The Town Red, but there just isn't. You beat an opponent with a bat or sword, it makes no difference. The physics are nearly the same. You still usually have to give them a good couple of wacks before they keel over. Meanwhile, they just slowly turn red. Like you're painting. \n\nGory physics? Well, you can decapitate heads sometimes. However, that seems to happen haphazardly. There is no other kind of dismemberment. It just doesn't have the gory physics that you see in other VR titles. It's more like paint dripping red than anything else. It's a sad state of affairs really. Yes there are different weapons you can use and you can even shoot some or throw some ... they just don't make that much of a difference in the end. It's more fun to just punch actually.\n\nSo the gameplay loop isn't interesting, but it also has limited content. There are 2 full maps, which you can beat in like 10 minutes each. There's also an arena mode and a developer torture mode, which is more exciting than it sounds. You'll want to torture the developers after playing this game, it just isn't fun actually playing the torture developer mode in this game.\n\nHave I mentioned the poor teleportation? Yeah, it's pretty bad here and I'm not even talking about the stamina system with the teleport. I mean the teleportation is badly implemented. You don't have full locomotion either. Oddly, you do have smooth turning, but it's way too slow so it's next to useless. Lastly, you can grab almost any item and use it as a weapon. There's several items you can grab. There's also several items you can't grab. I have no idea why that is. \n\nI got bored of this game after about 30 minutes. Every minute after that I just started hating the game more. So I didn't finish the arena mode (I did complete the office and the supermarket). I'm happy to uninstall this game and never touch it again. \n\n[b]Rate 4/10. Just play Paint The Town Red in 3D in VR using HelixVision. It's a much better experience, even without motion controls.[/b]\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed my review, please consider joining my Steam Curator group. HTC Vive & Valve Index users are welcome!
