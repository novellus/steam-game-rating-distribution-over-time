I love you to bits. The only flaw with this game is that I can't buy it twice. And the lack of replay-ability after the first play-through. And the fact that the hitbox on the hat is juuuuust a bit too small. Only small nitpicks that really don't take much from the expeirience (oh Christ I can't spell). And really don't matter much as the games strengths lie more in the humour and minigames. What was I saying? Oh yeah I want to kiss your face.","timestamp_created":1609357736,"timestamp_updated":1609357736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhMfM2vYCfpnwvgI="}
