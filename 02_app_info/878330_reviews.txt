I can finally play the game without hurting my eyes looking at a tiny window on my 4k screen. \n\nThis is an alright game.  It feels & plays EXACTLY like Bubble Bobble, except you defeat enemies differently.  The audio even sounds similar to Bubble Bobble. That should give you a good enough idea of how it is.  \n\nWill be recording the whole game later on once I find the time.","timestamp_created":1602298469,"timestamp_updated":1602298526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk+ebiPUCeNj3pgI="}
