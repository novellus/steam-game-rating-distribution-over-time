    short_description: Kabuto plans on breaking the Leaf's The Four-Corner Sealing
      Barrier from the inside by using Yukimaru's power and have the Three-Tailed
      Beast go on a rampage. Guren cannot argue, as Kabuto knows her weakness, but
      pleads for him to give her another chance to break the The Four-Corner Sealing
      Barrier.
