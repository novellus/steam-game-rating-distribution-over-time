So long as you have at least one person to join you (you can add bots to games if you don't have more than one), I'd say you're getting your money's worth.  Even without other people to play with, simply playing against bots is a fun way to pass the time and get your brain working in a new way without wearing it out.","timestamp_created":1595306634,"timestamp_updated":1595306634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541284441947937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwse3rt/MCcebRlgI="}
