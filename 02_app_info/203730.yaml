    about_the_game: Set in a mysterious and abstract sterile environment, <strong>Q.U.B.E.
      (Quick Understanding of Block Extrusion)</strong> is a first-person puzzle game
      that challenges players to navigate each level by manipulating coloured cubes
      that surround them. There's little to go on as the game begins - the player
      is dropped into an all-white room with few instructions, and simply has to figure
      their way out. The tone of game changes as the player finds small and big alterations
      to their environment, supported by an original score, inviting each player to
      let their imagination take over as to where they might be. Through experimentation
      and discovery, players will progress through an ever-evolving series of cube
      puzzles that will challenge them with logic, physics, platforming.
