    review: "A creepy game made by a guy who is yet to make a bad game. Can be played\
      \ for free online but i suggest you support this amazing dev and buy his games.\n\
      \nIts a trilogy of point and click games. I already played them so it took me\
      \ like 20 minutes to finish each one. Some puzzles but nothing too complicated.\
      \ \n\nBuy it and support an amazing developer!"
