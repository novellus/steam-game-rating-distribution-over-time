      \ Chaffee</strong><br>The Chaffee is a late-war American light tank. It is fast\
      \ and with its lightweight 75mm main gun it packs a serious punch compared to\
      \ other light tanks. The Chaffee is often used in harassing tactics against\
      \ heavier tanks.<br><br><strong>M3 Lee</strong>\t<br>The \u2018General Lee\u2019\
      \ is an American medium tank armed with a 75mm sponson mounted main gun, as\
      \ well as a 37mm turret-mounted gun. It requires an experienced tank crew to\
      \ get the full benefit of this special tank.<br><br><strong>M4A3E2 Sherman 'Jumbo'</strong><br>In\
      \ order to counter the formidable German tanks until the M26 Pershing becomes\
      \ available, this Sherman has been heavily modified. The Jumbo\u2019s 178mm\
      \ frontal glacis is able to resist a direct hit from the Tiger, but the added\
      \ weight comes at the cost of manoeuvrability.<br><br><strong>M18 Hellcat</strong><br>The\
      \ M18 Hellcat is an American tank destroyer. It is lightly armoured but extremely\
      \ fast and armed with a powerful 76mm cannon. The Hellcat\u2019s speed is used\
      \ to flank the enemy hitting heavier tanks in the side or rear.<br><br><strong>M2A2\
      \ Light Tank</strong><br>The M2A2 is an early American light tank. It is armed\
      \ with a .50 and a .30 caliber machine gun mounted in two separate turrets.\
      \ It is fast and dangerous to infantry and lightly armored vehicles.<br><br><strong>1911\
      \ Pistol</strong><br>The 1911 Pistol is a well proven, effective and hard hitting\
      \ handgun. With 8 shots in the magazine, fixed sights and a solid construction,\
      \ it is just the tool to help you get out of a tricky situation.<br><br><strong>Adjustable\
      \ Wrench</strong><br>The adjustable wrench or \u2018monkey wrench\u2019 is a\
      \ special kind of spanner that can adjust to many sizes of nuts. Ideal for use\
      \ in the field where tools for mechanical work and self-defence are sparse.<br><br><strong>Ribbon\
