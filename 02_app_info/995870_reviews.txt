A boss rush where you fight progressively harder bosses.\nThe patterns themselves are also fine. Those aren't really the problem, and were also quite interesting.\nHowever, I CANNOT pass up the anger I felt when I died to bosses due to your GIANT hitbox (you're a whole head). It really removes any fun you could have as a shoot'em up player and replaces it with... a bad feeling.\nSo there's that. If you played anything of this genre before you're not going to have fun, so don't buy it.","timestamp_created":1609487055,"timestamp_updated":1609487055,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ie+53vYCdrCqvwI="}
