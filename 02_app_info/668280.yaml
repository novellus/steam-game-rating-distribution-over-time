    review: 'Backslash is a standout competetive local multiplayer release.


      The clan system allows you to mix any two classes, or stick with a single class.
      This gives you a total of 55 different playstyles, and depending on the order
      you select your clan, 95 different character appearances.


      Each class has a passive and 4 skills. Rather than being key-bound skills go
      into a skill deck and once your mana is full, one randomly becomes available.
      This means you can choose to select a single class to narrow down your skill
      deck, but forgo a second passive.


      The combat itself is good. Mana generates slowly at first (and the rate seems
      to be different for different clans) but will generate faster in combat, and
      passively regenerate faster the longer the match continues. This manages the
      pace of matches excellently.


      The lack of control over which skills you get when also works surprisingly well.
      One would expect this to reduce your capacity to strategise, but this is not
      the case. Not only are you forced to adapt to the skill that becomes available,
      but you are also left with the choice of waiting to trigger it at the perfect
      time or triggering it at a sub-optimal time and hoping for the best in order
      to begin the charge up of the next skill.


      Balancing is quite good. Due to the single skill at any given time mechanic,
      syneries between two clans are limited. This means that instead of 55 permeations
      requiring specific balancing, there is only really 10. As is the case with every
      game with different classes, the balancing is not perfect, but as of yet I have
      not encountered any significant balancing issues.


      The biggest drawback this game currently has is the two player limit. This is
      a shame, as it appears perfect for 4 players. Hopefully this is a feature the
      developers will add in the future.
