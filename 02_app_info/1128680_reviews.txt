It turns out it's a pretty good puzzle game in the vein of adventures of Lolo or chip's challenge.\nThe puzzles are well designed and will test your sagacity and 'thinking-out-of-the-box' capacity.\nThere are boss levels too which are working well.\nThe crude graphics work hand in hand with the stupid story to give the game a zanny feeling which isn't bad at all.\n\nOnly problem is the music that is awful and some of the sound effects are very grating too. You'll want to put the game on mute.\nAlso: there is such a thing as \"too much\". There are too many levels and it's really discouraging to finish the game. Some of the later levels are either filler, or way too difficult and require to memorize dozens of twitch-second manipulations on every level. It really stops being fun.\nIt doesn't prevent you from finishing the game because the filler levels are in optional sections, but it's still a pity, especially if you were proud of 100%ing the game on your own until then.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1604115691,"timestamp_updated":1606605160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5KfIiPYCdLybqwI="}
