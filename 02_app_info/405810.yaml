    review: 'This game has mostly solid stylized art, intereting ideas and a solid
      concept, but the game almost completely misses the mark.  It''s not terrible,
      but I believe that at 10 dollars it is a waste of money.  Wait for a sale or
      something.


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdBfAytZSzc


      This game is a combination of action platforming and roguelite.  Being a fan
      of roguelites I was excited to get my hands on this game, as the art style looked
      really cool, but it falls short in so many areas that make it hard to recommend.


      First, platforming is paramount in this game.  That''s perfectly fine, as I
      loved Risk of Rain and platforming is very important there, too.  However, Valzar''s
      controls are sluggish at best.  You feel as though you''re walking in molasses
      which makes traversing through the environment an absolute chore.  The worst
      part is that you have to trek your butt back to the exit door at the end of
      each room, and when you find yourself at the bottom of a pit having killed the
      last enemy, you curse the fact that you have to painstakingly climb your way
      up with the slow and clumsy movement.


      Second, the combat, while initially fine, quickly devolves into chaos with unavoidable
      damage.  You move in molasses while your enemies fly toward you.  I''ve had
      enemies get knocked up then track me perfectly as they fall.  I''ve had enemies
      shoot endless strings of homing bullets that move faster than me.  I''ve been
      hit by so many things that I couldn''t really understand than I could count.  Combat
      in these games is supposed to be fun, but in Valzar it is a chore.  A barrier
      in your way that you have to chip at for 2 billion years through many lives.  It
      could drive a man mad.


      Third, the game seems indecisive on what it feels like it needs to explain,
      mechanics-wise.  For the most part it''s okay, but there''s moments when you
      have to make a choice to keep your spells as they are or or replace it with
      something else.  You can test it out there, but sometimes the text is ridiculously
      vague, leaving you to make a blind choice.  You can always go back to the room,
      but that wastes valuable resources and time, forcing you to enter each room
      (rooms are moved to from a world map in a adjacent tile kind of system) even
      if you''ve already cleared it.


      Finally, on the nitpicky side, the UI and control scheme is just awkward.  The
      START button on the controller is unmapped, but Left Bumper opens the inventory.  What?!


      Valzar''s ideas are there, but the execution falls way short in the most important
      categories.  Unless there''s massive patches to combat unavoidable damage or
      make platforming less infuriating, this game will be little more than frustrating.'
