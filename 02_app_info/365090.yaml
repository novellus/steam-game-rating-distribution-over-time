    review: "I purchased this game while having the winter/Christmas season in mind.\
      \ I paid $5.49 CAD so my expectations were not that high at all, but I ended\
      \ up having a ton of fun. \n\n    The game consists of 2-4 players having a\
      \ snowball fight (Human or AI). You start with 5 hearts each and the aim is\
      \ to \u201Ckill\u201D the other player. During a match you can use a light or\
      \ heavy shot. A heavy shot being performed while holding the throw button to\
      \ charge it up. The winner being the first to kill X amount of people or being\
      \ the leader after the time limit is up.\n\nThis game contains 4 maps: Park,\
      \ Graveyard, Castle & Mine. While they do not affect the gameplay or strategies\
      \ you will find different objects to take cover behind in each. The store page\
      \ boasts 30 characters to play, but 25 of those characters need to be unlocked.\
      \ This isn\u2019t a bad thing though. The character does not affect the gameplay\
      \ either and from what I could tell, are completely aesthetic. \n\n    If you\
      \ want to unlock everything it the game, you will need to play a minimum of\
      \ 73 matches. The matches being broken down into 17 for Park, Graveyard and\
      \ Castle, with the Mine level needing 22 matches to obtain the unlockables.\
      \ The unlockables in the game come in the form of characters and powerups. Power\
      \ ups range from grenades for higher damage to a snowman sentry which will fight\
      \ the enemies for you. The matches themselves can be set from 2:00 \u2013 20:00\
      \ and from 5 \u2013 100 kills. \n\n    Besides the single player deathmatch\
      \ modes, you can also have teamplay deathmach modes as well. I\u2019ve only\
      \ had a chance to play with one friend locally, so I can\u2019t say if it can\
      \ support a full 4 player local game or not. The settings for the team-deathmatch\
      \ can be set to 2vs2 or 3vs1.\n\n    Overall, I enjoyed the characters/costumes\
      \ and the gameplay was fun. For the price, I would recommend this game."
