    review: This game is hard like really hard. I love it to death though (pun intended).
      It's visuals are trippy and well done and it's story line is off the walls bonkers.
      It's Celery Emblem at it's finest. It also has PSX styled graphics and whats
      not to love about that? Also Celery if you're reading this please release the
      soundtrack in North America, it says it's still pending release even though
      it was supposed to release with the game it looks like. Please Celery, I need
      to jam out to the songs without watching the intro over and over.
