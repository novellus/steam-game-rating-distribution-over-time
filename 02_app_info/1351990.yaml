    review: "I think this is the dlc showing up on my main menu, as needing to be\
      \ purchased for 800 points. My account says I own it, so Im a little afraid\
      \ to buy the dlc, and lose 800 points. Those are slow to collect.\n\nAs for\
      \ the dlc itself, Im not sure how I feel about them. Theyre more of the same\
      \ kindve missions, on nearly identical maps, but have some story to them.  They\
      \ dont really separate themselves from what the game already offers. That they\
      \ could be purchased with in game currency, i do like, because I hate the piecemeal\
      \ dlc garbage. \n\nThe one with Thorn actually felt slightly different, fighting\
      \ the forces of chaos, in an abandoned, and secret Storm Watchers base. That\
      \ one, I really enjoyed the story, and difficulty"
