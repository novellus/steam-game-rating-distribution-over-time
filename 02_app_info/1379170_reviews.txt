Bagration was an overwhelming Soviet assault with massive superiority  in all areas, this is not reflected in the scenario. I want a challenge but it wants to be historically somewhat accurate surely. Either make it a time based challenge or give a lot more non core units or resource points to Soviets.  \nStill a great game .","timestamp_created":1608214272,"timestamp_updated":1608214272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgMvCuPYCf7T5ugI="}
