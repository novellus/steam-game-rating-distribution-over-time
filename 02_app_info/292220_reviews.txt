The songs are good and one of the two main reasons to get this DLC/upgrade. The other one is the cool strategy guide that can help out with preparing a plan to beat (and 100%) each level. There is also an art book if you want to check that out. The only in-game item is the Black Champion armor but it has a bit of a clunky way of activating and deactivating - press Enter and type in \"/dark\" to turn it on and \"/classic\" to turn it off. If you love this game a lot get it full price, otherwise wait for one of the sales.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1494655275,"timestamp_updated":1500525059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562021434307098389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u+uQr90Cddb+eA=="}
