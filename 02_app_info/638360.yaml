      to be; down on his luck and fretting for the future. One fateful night, he carelessly
      decides to drown his sorrows with strong libations - and he runs up a tab at
      a pub he knows he can't pay...Remarkably; Instead of a reproachful speech and
      coarse removal, he is instead told a tale he can hardly believe. A tale involving
      great riches, but even greater peril. If he was not so desperate, he wouldn't
      conceive of embarking on what could be a wild goose chase to locate a forgotten
      and virtually unknown town. Half-Rats' doubts were abated somewhat when the
      publican shews his utmost sincerity - albeit in a strange and effusive manner
      - and draws him a rude map.<br><br>&quot;Thank the lord, for he smote that place
      from the Earth in '81. We lived, but most met their destruction the night that

      was a vault in the bank, large sums of money would have been stole away there,
      safe. We vowed never to go back, to keep that place a dread secret until tonight.&quot;<br><br>The

    review: "This mod is very good, I've been a fan of the half rats series for a\
      \ since the first game came out. A Fever dream was just a simple Half Life reskin,\
      \ reskined weapons, reskinned enemies, and reskinned npcs, its stength was its\
      \ simplicity, but now Parasomnia has to stand on its own, and it mostly succeeds.\
      \ \n\n-Firstly the new inventory system is great, insted of having to worry\
      \ if you can find a meat pie or whisky when you're at low health you can carry\
      \ them with you. There is also a money system, you find either money or gold\
      \ and can use it at stores or vending machines to buy ammo and health items.\
      \ \n\n-The maps are good aswell, they are very big and non linear making thw\
      \ world feel more real, however at times the maps are very dark and you can\
      \ often get lost, and let me return to the inventory, you have a launtern that\
      \ burns fuel, and you only have a limited supply, you can run out of fuel however\
      \ i rarely encountered this since fuel is usually plentiful if you explore.\
      \ The atmosphere is great it gives me a They Hunger vive when i played this.\
      \ However some maps are bad, the corn field for example isnt a bad idea but\
      \ executed poorly some of the corn stalks you can walk through but then some\
      \ act as solid walls, making it worse is that several enemies are chasing you\
      \ making the whole thing VERY frustaraiting.\n\n-The weapons, I think theyre\
      \ good. There are problems however, unless i just missed them the Henry and\
      \ double barrel shotgun only spawn once, so if you miss them you're really out\
      \ of luck. If you do get them they are good, then henry is deadly at most ranges\
      \ and the shotgun can kill almost anything at close range. Some of the features\
      \ seem a but useless. The colt's seconday the \"ghetto blaster\" downright sucks,\
      \ it doesnt fire fast enough and you can't hit the broad side of a barn with\
      \ it.\n\n-The voice acting is good, it's over the top bit it fits with the game,\
      \ but my problems are with Half-Rats' voice lines, for fucks sake add more pain\
      \ lines than just \"woah this calls for an amputation\". Other than that the\
      \ acting is good. The sound track is great and worth paying the dollar for the\
      \ OST.\n\n- The enemies are great, they all are different and have unique designs.\
      \ There are some problems however the zombie cops have guns so it make sense\
      \ for them to drop ammo, but for the amount of bullets it takes to kill them\
      \ they drop too much ammo and at some parts it is very easy due to being fully\
      \ stocked up on ammo at all times, mainly the henry can kill them with 1 or\
      \ 2 headshots and you get 10 bullets in return. The bosses are cool but leave\
      \ a lot to be desired. One you can just kill with a machine gun you can pick\
      \ up, the next is melee only with a sword, sound cool and is a challenging fight\
      \ but it you can just kick him to death. The final boss I like but if you have\
      \ a cocaine lozenge it becomes really easy.\n\n-Overall I recomend this mod\
      \ to anyone who likes half life mods, and any old They Hunger fans, it has a\
      \ unique setting and great atmosphere."
