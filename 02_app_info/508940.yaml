    review: "Escape Lizards has some flaws, but it's a good game overall and perhaps\
      \ the closest you're going to get to Super Monkey Ball on Steam. A few other\
      \ reviews were justifiably hacked off with some camera issues, but the dev has\
      \ recently fixed this and added tons of miscellaneous graphical and camera options\
      \ to boot, as well as altering gameplay mechanics and rebalancing the entire\
      \ game. Thumbs up there.\n\nThis is the only marble game I've found where you\
      \ tilt the game world rather than your ball, hence the emulation of Super Monkey\
      \ Ball. Obviously it isn't quite up to that lofty standard, but a lot of effort\
      \ has gone into Escape Lizards and the core gameplay certainly works. You move\
      \ through the levels by tilting the floor, and also have the option of flipping\
      \ the environment at 90 degree angles at any point, which makes for some interesting\
      \ and tricky paths through levels. If you're a speedrunner or love messing around\
      \ with absurd shortcuts through levels, you'll probably love this mechanic.\
      \ The movement feels pretty slick and unusually for the genre, you have a lot\
      \ of control over your aerial movement in addition to being able to jump. Combining\
      \ all of the above would assuredly make for some crazy tricks from better players\
      \ than myself.\n\nThe amount of content is very solid, with 110 levels across\
      \ 11 environments. In each level there are three main goals: time medal, collecting\
      \ all coins and knocking all vulture eggs off the stage. I mostly went for time\
      \ on my first pass through, then went back for a bit of casual monetary exploration\
      \ and vulture genocide. The levels themselves are very varied, and this is possibly\
      \ the biggest strength of the game. Some are straight speed gauntlets, others\
      \ being large mazes and more still involving numerous obstacles in your path\
      \ - no two levels are the same, and there are new varieties of obstacle introduced\
      \ regularly. Collecting (almost) everything took me 16 hours, with the later\
      \ levels taking quite a few tries to net all of the coins in particular, which\
      \ is a good amount of content for the price.\n\nThe downsides are that this\
      \ is a budget indie title, so while the graphics and environments are functional,\
      \ they're not going to set the gaming world ablaze. Level difficulty can also\
      \ be uneven - the whole game rebalanced has been a sizeable net positive overall,\
      \ but occasionally you'll bump into a time limit that seems stricter than it\
      \ should be, or some bizarrely positioned coins. The developer could well patch\
      \ some of these in the future, though. It's also worth noting that while I don't\
      \ suffer from motion sickness at all, those that do should turn down the camera\
      \ sensitivity significantly - it flicks around a lot, and could be quite jarring.\n\
      \nEscape Lizards had a strange start to life on Steam, initially being priced\
      \ at double the current price, then reduced down to \xA33 (too cheap, really)\
      \ before finding the current happy medium. Perhaps that, combined with the niche\
      \ genre, is why it's relatively undiscovered. Still, I had fun with the game\
      \ and would recommend it to marble game enthusiasts and those who enjoy a bit\
      \ of a challenge in 3D platformers. Also, the hilarious voiceover in the menus\
      \ is almost worth the price of admission alone."
