    about_the_game: "The M60-2000 was a prototype upgrade for the M60 Patton series\
      \ of Main Battle Tanks from the late 1990s. The idea behind it was to replace\
      \ the old M60 turret with one from the Abrams MBT in order to provide a cost-effective\
      \ solution for the owners of the Patton series. It was offered to several countries\
      \ with Turkey showing the most interest, but lost the competition for Turkish\
      \ M60 upgrades to the Israeli Sabra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare,\
      \ the M60-2000 is a Tier 7 Main Battle Tank. Its main advantages include well-protected\
      \ turret and a 120mm M256 gun on Tier 7, making this tank a deadly opponent,\
      \ especially if fighting defensively with the hull hidden behind cover. However,\
      \ its hull is quite fragile for its tier, making this tank more suitable as\
      \ a second-line support vehicle, firing at its enemies from distance."
