Also his power is multiplied when the enemy is weaken by the other allied mercenaries, it really adds something fresh to the genre.\n\n\nThe strength of the game is found in its whole bunch of spells and power-ups and the many ways to launch creative and powerful spell combos! The behavior of the enemies is meant to be predictable (as described in \"the book\" in-game). A spell on its own won't do much but by playing with the allies, the enemy HP, fear meter, and positioning I was able to wipe out the entire screen. And it's satisfying.","timestamp_created":1574461505,"timestamp_updated":1574461505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43v/Nyu4CfqP62wE="}
