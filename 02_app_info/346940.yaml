      \ of course.<br><br><strong>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: </strong><i>Shadowrun:\

      \ a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that could only be possible\

    review: "TL:DRSo I will get right down too it. Yes I would recommend it. If you\
      \ liked previous games, the fallout 1 and 2, as well as the Planescape torment\
      \ series. Decent character stat options and combat function. Story and combat\
      \ might be okay. I would call the character design a 8. Gameplay is a 9 as it\
      \ is very noob friendly and combat is turn basebut , but maybe it can go rts\
      \ for some more challenge? Story is about a 7 to me. It is over all about a\
      \ 6.5 to me. Very enjoyable but a few things can get repetitive. the characters\
      \ you can run into made it worth it to me. \n\n\n\nThe LONG PART\nIt is basically\
      \ a distopian futuristic scifi fantasy....yes it has all of that. You have magic\
      \ mixed with technology so some fun game combat options, from guns and swords,\
      \ robot enhance body parts and personal death bots, to blowing magic balls of\
      \ fire. D&D in the future? Your basically a shadowrunner, a merc of sorts. Story\
      \ is alright, nothing too complicated, you got in a no win win situation that\
      \  has yuo running around trying to fix something that as just kinda thrust\
      \ upon you and your team. Combat is same thing over and over, but there is a\
      \ few sneak quests."
