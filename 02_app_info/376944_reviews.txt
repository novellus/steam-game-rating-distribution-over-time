The DLC is a huge let down overall. Par for the course from dovefail. \n\nPros:\n- Scenery. The route itself looks pretty good. There are minimal graphic glitches (in some locations the water pops below ground spastically). PC performance is average.\n- Trains included with the route are based on the prototype. ARR has GP38s and SD70MACs. They are represented in the activities.\n- There is dispatch audio when the dispatcher is speaking to the player. It's prerecorded and applies only to scripted scenarios but I still think it's a nice touch. They could definitely use this concept across many other routes.\n\nCons:\n- Sounds. Recycled garbage from many years ago. The Geep sounds like the BN GP38-2 from Chicago-Aurora Racetrack DLC. The SD70MAC has the original SD70 sounds from 2012.\n- Scenarios are limited. Two sessions broken out into four and three part series. Typical control freak stop-on-a-dime-as-marked or fail the whole scenario. Leaves a lot to be desired for those who understand US, and specifically ARR, operations.\n- Route is freight only. Not a single passenger car or schedule is even mentioned. The ARR operates an extensive passenger schedule. Real opportunity missed by the devs.\n- Signals are the original Kuju models introduced to Rail Simulator in 2007. The aspects are generally incorrect. The models are dated, look subpar and have errors which haven't been fixed in 14 years of development/updates.\n\nThis route needs severe amounts of attention and should not have been released in its current state (again, typical from dovefail). If you enjoy Alaska Railroad operations or want to expand North American content, I highly suggest waiting for a sale greater than 60% discounted. The route is not worth more than about $15 as it stands today.","timestamp_created":1608672601,"timestamp_updated":1608672722,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxbeXxvYCeIKjvAI="}
