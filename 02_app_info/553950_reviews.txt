I think moving with a mouse would make this majorly better for me to play. its why i bought it on PC after trying it on Switch. I thought you could move with the mouse :(\n\nIt's also hard to tell where the character is due to the camera, but the camera makes it cooler.\nAWESOME music, AWESOME retro style. i'm fully immersed.\n\nI wish it had a level picker. I managed to get the third boss fight (the one after big face guy uses Centipede dragon's gun).\n\nI enjoyed the Centipede Dragon fight! 10/10 would befriend Centidragon.","timestamp_created":1596842838,"timestamp_updated":1596844307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534883737564086914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o87V5fMCdZKJmgI="}
