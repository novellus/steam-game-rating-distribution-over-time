    about_the_game: A former Marine and ex-FBI agent, Joe has seen one too many crime
      scenes and known too much trauma, and not just in his professional life. Solitary
      and haunted, he prefers to be invisible. He doesn't allow himself friends or
      lovers and makes a living rescuing young girls from the deadly clutches of the
      sex trade. But when a high-ranking New York politician hires him to extricate
      his teenage daughter from a Manhattan brothel, Joe uncovers a web of corruption
      that even he may not be able to unravel. When the men on his trail take the
      only person left in the world who matters to him, he forsakes his pledge to
      do no harm. If anyone can kill his way to the truth, it's Joe.

    review: "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nHad the potential to be so much more;\
      \ but instead fell flat on its face. This snail-paced psycho thriller really\
      \ leaves one to believe the directors didn't understand what they we're getting\
      \ themselves into. \n\nIt does however receive 2 stars for it's moderately decent\
      \ acting and what little action we do get to see."
