With all the new content and tweaks to the formula, it feels a lot like a full blown squeal!\n\nThe new villains are delightfully devilish, and the heroes are so vividly stoic in their portrayal. I get a sense that the folks behind the expansion had a whole heap of fun making it. It's a joy to play!","timestamp_created":1609788070,"timestamp_updated":1609789981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lLi95/YCcNe9wAI="}
