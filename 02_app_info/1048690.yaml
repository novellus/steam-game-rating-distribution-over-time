    review: "Let me start off by saying Cosmic Cash is an incredibly challenging space\
      \ shooter.\nRemember Galaga? (me either, it's older than I am)\nWell its like\
      \ Galaga on crack. \nIt's hard. Don't expect this game to pat you on the back\
      \ for pressing space bar. This isn't chicken invaders.\nYou try to earn money\
      \ to buy upgrades by betting on how well you will do.\nYou'll probably nearly\
      \ always lose money because you're just not good enough.\nFor less than the\
      \ price of a coffee this game offers a serious challenge for those with big\
      \ space balls.\n\n"
