    detailed_description: <h1>Just Updated</h1><p>VERZAKEN! IS NOW IN VR!!<br><br>We
      have just been working hard making Verzaken! fully VR compatible!<br><br>I have
      one thing to say about it..... This. Game. Was. Made. For. VR!! <br><br>In other
      words, if you've played the original pancake/flat version.... fo'getta bout'it!
      Verzaken! VR is like a whole new game!<br><br>Fully compatible with room-scale
      and motion controls on the HTC Vive. Oculus and WMR support coming very soon.
      If the game doesnt start in VR immediately, try opening SteamVR first (this
      seems to be a problem with SteamVR, not Verzaken).<br><br>And a new feature
      to make it easy to retrieve your Pickaxe in VR- just reach behind your back!
      Seriously, with the right controller, reach behind your back, hold the trigger
      starting from behind your back and while holding right trigger, bring the controller
      back to the front of you in an arc, releasing Trigger at about your belly. Your
      Pickaxe will be magically returned to you!<br><br>  ALSO!!! Besides the tons
      of other improvements made, we have also added a brand-new ending! Be sure to
      collect all the artifacts if you want to see it!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong><i>&quot;You

    developer_response: "  To clarify your issues, this game is not tested on the\
      \ Oculus Rift and not guaranteed to work. Rift+Touch compatibility is a hope\
      \ for the future. Sorry for your experience.\n\n    That being said, if you\
      \ had a Vive, which is the system this game was built for and tested on, VR\
      \ mode would have been an option upon startup. \n\n     Again, the description\
      \ clearly stated Oculus/Touch compatibility is untested. That is a fair reason\
      \ for a refund, as you clearly didn't realize that compatibility for your device\
      \ was not guaranteed. And your other criticisms are fair game. That being said,\
      \ a fair review would clear up the fact that your hardware was not compatible.\
      \ It's kind of a big point.\n\n However as someone that worked hard on this\
      \ game by myself with some help from only one other person, and built this game\
      \ as my first as I taught myself to code, your other criticisms are completely\
      \ fair! This game will never be my best work, possibly my worst and possibly\
      \ not. It is what it is, and as I develop my professional skills, I still have\
      \ a family to take care of, and it is completely understandable if any particular\
      \ thing I create with my growing skills is not up to par in terms of quality,\
      \ that is certainly your criticism to make as a potential game buyer. I respect\
      \ that completely, and I appreciate your review and the time you spent. Thanks,\
      \ and don't discount future products! Everyone starts somewhere, and I'm not\
      \ ashamed of having started somewhere! Have a good one."

    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      It works! Sort of. Actually, VR does not work automatically. You have to go\
      \ into the game folders. Then get into the VR folder. Make sure Steam VR is\
      \ running. Then double click on the VR game executable file, Classic mode is\
      \ not available. \n\nSo now you started the game. The only option is arcade\
      \ mode. So you have a laser pointer to make selections and get rid of the text\
      \ bubbles. Then you can pickup a pickaxe and an axe. You grab them by selecting\
      \ trigger. You notice that neither of them sit correctly in your hands. In fact,\
      \ the pickaxe is facing the wrong direction where your Touch controller is facing.\n\
      \nAnyways, you wave your hands and trees fall with the axe. Rocks get excavated\
      \ with your pickaxe. Kill enemies with your axe. Except, nothing feels right.\
      \ It's almost impossible to tell when you've hit an enemy or rock or tree. It\
      \ feels like you're aimlessly waving your hands. Combat is some of the worst\
      \ that exits in VR.\n\nThe game world looks ugly and repetitive. Is there an\
      \ objective? Just keep killing enemies over and over and keep excavating rocks\
      \ for worthless artifacts and different skinned weapons that feel the same?\
      \ Is there a point to anything. If the game were free to play, I still wouldn't\
      \ recommend it. The fact that the dev wants $3 for this is amazing. I should\
      \ be paid $3 for troubleshooting your game and getting the VR to work.\n\nRate\
      \ 3/10. I'm asking for a refund. I hate to do it, but this game is absolutely\
      \ awful. Besides, VR doesn't work and I only got it to work because I figured\
      \ it out on my own."
