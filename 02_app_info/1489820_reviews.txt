Also the progression seems to be slow and I don't know whats going on. There also seems to be no options within the game, I was not able to turn down sound in the game.\n\nOverall, the game isn't worth any amount of money, what is there can barely be considered a game.","timestamp_created":1608416843,"timestamp_updated":1608416843,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624811708927154541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4z6rHvvYCe+XFuwI="}
