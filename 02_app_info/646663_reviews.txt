Multiball locks happen naturally and with the flow of the table, as 3 lanes are lock lanes, one of which is a frequent lane for modes. Everything about this table incentivises you to play for lanes which only contributes to the flow. The multiball alone is simple, but sees you racking up BIG points as you can pull off double super jackpots at every opportunity. It requires you to \"relock\" the balls in short 5 second burst, if you manage to lock all 3 in that allotted time you can get a double superjackpot, at which it dispenses all back 3 at you for you to try again. If you're good at juggling you can see scores of 70million a pop. It's insanely satisfying.\n\nI haven't even talked about the sound either. The music is good, but the way this table speaks to you is fantastic. All the sound effects are cartoony but with an 80s arcade sound. Even the ramps have this wooshing synth sound that calls back to my times spend in arcades as a kid. Honestly I cannot express how great this table is!\n\nAs for A force. It's an awesome table, just somewhat overshadowed by champions. The ramps have good flow, the skillshot is fun, and the modes are a bit more complicated than that of champions. Wizard mode is a nice touch, as it disables the flippers and has you playing multiball through impact explosions which is fun.\n\nI gave these a bit of a miss after buying them, I'm not particularly big on Marvel (in fact, truth be told, I can't stand marvel as I find it all incredibly cheesy) but after giving these tables some time it has taught me to not judge a pin by theme alone, obviously it can help you enjoy a game or hate it (some tables have the most jarring music and sounds) but I can say without any shadow of a doubt that both of these pins are creative and wonderful tables that deserve a look, even if like me you're not a marvel fan.","timestamp_created":1594466346,"timestamp_updated":1594466346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548979580402374268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwbTmnvMCdK/FlAI="}
