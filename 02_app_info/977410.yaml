    about_the_game: <i>Winterfield, Michigan. Year 2020. The crime rate and corruption
      level are at record high. November Massacre riots crippled the city. The mayor
      and city council are nothing, but puppets for the mob which took over the city.
      Police barely exists because of massive budget cuts, those who remained basically
      live on bribes. People are just trying to survive here as things in the city
      get worse and worse...</i><br><br><strong><u>The Dealer</u></strong> is a point
      &amp; click dialogue driven game where you play as a street dealer in <strong>Winterfield</strong>,
      the most troubled city in the fictional version of the United States, set against
      catastrophic economic and political situation, and looming civil war. After
      losing poker game with the local mob boss, <strong>Jack Coin</strong>, you are
      given 10 days to get 10000$, otherwise you are dead. Left without job because
      of mass layoffs in the city and blacklisted from every bank and credit service
      out there, your only choice is to ask your shady friend, <strong>Lenny</strong>,
      for help. With his support, you have to dive deep into the world of spontaneous
      trade in order to survive. You need to sell everything you can get, from bottle
      caps to drugs and guns, to different strangers; face hard moral decisions; avoid
      cops and dangerous customers; pay the rent; and also deal with the increasingly
      difficult political situation in the country that directly affects both your
      life and the city.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/977410/extras/SteamLogo28.png?t=1608068546"
