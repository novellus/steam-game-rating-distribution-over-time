    about_the_game: Gooblins is a First-Person Shooter for the HTC Vive that pits
      the player against never-ending waves of Gooblins. These cute but deadly creatures
      are hell-bent on using plasma blasts, fireballs, and kamikaze attacks to destroy
      you. As you progress through waves, Gooblin firepower and defense capability
      increases. Survive long enough to unlock your machine gun to make quick work
      of unshielded Gooblins. While mowing them down is satisfying, high scores on
      the leaderboard can only be achieved by killing Gooblins in the color order
      indicated on your weapon display. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/517620/extras/Gooblins_ico_32.png?t=1508451847"
