You can find a user manual inside the game folder and if you press N you will get the area objectives/missions. The first part of the game is not intended to be difficult, but you do have to equip a weapon in your inventory (press I, then right-click with the mouse to equip). \n\nThe latest update (3.1) has improved on this but we can also add a better explenation/tutorial in the beginning."}],"cursor":"AoJw/PGSlfACdYmW8QE="}
