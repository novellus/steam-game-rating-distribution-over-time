    about_the_game: "Award-winning Black Isle Studios unleashes an epic RPG like no\
      \ other. In the 12th century, a supernatural catastrophe tore the fabric of\
      \ reality, unleashing spirits and magic, forever changing medieval Earth. Cast\
      \ into this world and besieged by spirits and power groups, you must gain allies,\
      \ take up arms and find your destiny. <br><br>To the common folk, magic was\
      \ something to be feared and undoubtedly the handiwork of evil demons. People\
      \ across Europe sought protection from the forces of evil and therefore relinquished\
      \ utter control of their lives to the Inquisition. <br><br>To this day, the\
      \ Inquisition still governs most of civilized Europe, directly or indirectly.\
      \ In their relentless hunt for heretical wizards and magical creatures the Inquisition\
      \ inspires awe and faith among many, and is despised and feared by others.<br>Choose\
      \ your champion \u2013 Feralkin, Sylvant, Demonkin, or Human Pureblood \u2013\
      \ and align yourself with the Knights Templar, the Inquisition, or the Wielders.\
      \ Explore 16th century Europe, twisted and changed by magic, and encounter the\
      \ likes of Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An\
