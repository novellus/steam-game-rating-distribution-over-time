      Still.


      Edit: Abandonware.


      Edit2: Game is making a comeback - review changed to positive - I have faith!


      Edit3: Game is abandonware, developers do not respond, no updates dead game,
      nothing happening.


      Edit4: I joined there Discord, they ignored my questions, others responded with
      random riddles ._.


      Edit5: Wanna play my server?'
