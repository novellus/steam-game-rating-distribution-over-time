    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Kitty Rainbow is the 2D platformer where rainbows
      are your platforms, weapons and shields.</h2><br>You play as a rainbow-wielding
      cat on a mission to spread brightly coloured joy by removing bumble bees, off-beat
      music, and other unpleasant things. Your rainbows protect you from the bad things
      that can kill you and also provide you with platforms to walk and jump on.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Cat on a rainbow</h2>Chasing you is the misery ghost who lurks
      near you at the start of every level. Initially stunned for several seconds
      the misery ghost wants to keep everything dull, grey and joyless. Spend too
      long shooting rainbows and jumping on rainbows and the ghost hunts you with
      increasing ferocity.<h2 class="bb_tag">Mysterache is your magical feline friend</h2>At
      the top of every level the Persian cat Mysterache is there to greet you. In
      his palace he offers you a random choice of three powerful permanent rewards
      to aid you on your rainbow mission. Touching his face removes all remaining
      enemies in play with his magic words and vanquishes the misery ghost.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gems
      and goodies</h2>To help you there are items to collect that appear when an enemy
      dies. Collect 7 gems of each rainbow colour and Mysterache automatically grants
      you another run at a level if you die - very handy since you only start with
      one life! Collect a powerup and enjoy a temporary freeze of time or witness
      the power of giant rainbows!
