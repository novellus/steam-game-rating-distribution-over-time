You have between 10 and 15 levels to learn how it works and interacts with the other ones. The 8th and last part of the game feels like a treat: nothing is new, you just have 13 more levels to have fun with.\n\nIn other words, the level design was good. I was only wondering a few times why some elements were there, because I did not use them at all: it was probably due to levels having multiple solutions. The very last level was brilliant: it took me quite some time to solve it, but I really enjoyed the thought process of getting to the solution.\n\nThe look and feel of the game is a perfect fit for the genre: the visuals are beautiful but clear, the interface does not go in your way, and the ambiant music is great to focus on the puzzles.\n\nOverall, a solid game. Bonus point for working flawlessly on Linux-based systems.","timestamp_created":1524249728,"timestamp_updated":1582388621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575671851634979248","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47MXttvACdLDUngE="}
