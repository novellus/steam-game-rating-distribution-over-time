    review: "This game isn't close to finished. It is so far away from what I would\
      \ expect at a $50 price point that I'm not sure it ever will be. This experience,\
      \ at the price of a AAA game, pissed me off honestly.\n\nNo tutorial whatsoever,\
      \ no mouseovers (this is minor compared to the other things).\n\nThere are only\
      \ 6 planes for both sides combined. Aircraft performance ratings look really\
      \ simple and arcadey. Se5a has a full circle of speed, Camel has a circle with\
      \ one pie slice missing. Camel has full maneuverability, Se5a is missing a slice\
      \ there. It doesn't make me believe that the in-game aircraft flight characteristics\
      \ resemble those of the actual planes.\n\nI fought a dogfight, and there was\
      \ nothing about the gameplay, graphics, sound, or experience at all which stuck\
      \ out. The AI pilot (playing the second lowest difficulty) largely just flew\
      \ in a straight line or a turn which was so shallow it actually kept throwing\
      \ me off when I was trying to track and lead him. You just assume that when\
      \ dogfighting, your opponent will try to turn sharply, but this AI wouldn't\
      \ do what every other combat flight AI knows well to do.\n\nGraphics resembled\
      \ Red Baron 3-D. Better than that, yes, but closer to Red Baron 3d than a modern\
      \ game like Rise of Flight.\n\nThe management interface is a disaster. It's\
      \ not readily apparent what I'm supposed to do, what the resources are, or how\
      \ many I need. That's not because the interface is too complicated, but because\
      \ it's so poorly put together. The fonts are messed up, it's super simplistic.\
      \ \n\nIf you've ever coded, have you ever written a program and created an interface,\
      \ and you're at the point where you're just testing stuff... so you've got the\
      \ basic buttons and they're not sized right and it looks really ugly, but you\
      \ don't care because you're just doing runs to test out numbers or screen loading\
      \ or something? It looks like that, like zero time was put into it.\n\nI can't\
      \ exit the settings menu without completely exiting the game. Same thing if\
      \ I complete a dogfight.\n\nIn the career menu, if I select 'mission', the map\
      \ of the front only covers the upper left portion of the screen and I can't\
      \ interact with it or start a mission. The rest of the screen is the main squadron\
      \ screen and the whole setup with the map looks unintentional. It's probably\
      \ not resizing like it is supposed to, and if that's the case then this aspect\
      \ of the game was not tested at all.\n\nI know that the reviews on the VR and\
      \ VR controls have been poor so far. But I wasn't playing VR. I was on a standard\
      \ flatscreen using an Xbox 360 controller - the controller did work without\
      \ having to remap or anything, that's the one positive thing I can say.\n\n\
      All I can think is that this game was entirely written with VR in mind, then\
      \ they realized they couldn't get VR working by their deadline, and so tried\
      \ to throw a more simplified version out there so they would have something\
      \ released in December. \n\nNo real positives here. I wouldn't have kept what\
      \ I played tonight if it had been $5 instead of $50. Warplanes WW1 dogfight\
      \ which is free to play, arcadey, based on a mobile game, and also with simplistic\
