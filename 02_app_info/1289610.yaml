    review: No words about how this game surprised me. I buy it thinking of another
      simple visual novel and... NO. This change my memory in each text, each happening
      and each choose I get on game. Im playing again now and I want to see all the
      possible finals. The gameplay is never the same and the game seems to give you
      more and more new stuff. I tell everyone who like a original and new game (Which
      unfortunally great games miss this) should play this amazing indie.
