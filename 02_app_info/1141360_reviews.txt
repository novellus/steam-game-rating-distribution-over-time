While it does have good controller support and the skill sytem looks neat, it falls short in certain fields. There is no escape from combat, i guess they call that \"roguelike\". Then I managed to play the game for 4 hours and not recruit another character, 4 hours and still solo? Every character that looks like they are on the one screen all tell you that grouping with you is akin to stabbing themselves in the face. It is a group dungeon crawl game where everyone tells you to *bleep* off? I've heard of wanting things to be difficult but going solo to level 4 of a dungeon where level 2 will murder you? This game is highly recommended but has failed in all ways an rpg can fail for me. If for some reason i could form a party and get past level 2 i would judge the game less harshly, but how can one see the romance options if the game tells you to not play it 4 hours in?","timestamp_created":1609303808,"timestamp_updated":1609303808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgOv+2PYCe5HWvgI="}
