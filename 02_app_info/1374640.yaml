      /><br><br>Winter means shutting up shop for a bee hive, hunkering down and riding
      out the cold with the resources gathered from that year. A shutdown with less
      than desirable resources leads to peril, players must make sure this doesn't
      happen. Teamwork is everything as players have to manage different aspects of
      the hive at the same time, from collecting pollen from the worker bees to dropping
      off lost souls to the reaper bee. <br><br>Knowing who's doing what and taking
      things where is key, as disruption to the workflow could be disastrous! <br><br><img

      /><br><br>While this all may sound stressful, working in a hive has one major
      benefit... NO UNIFORMS! Wear whatever you want to work and save the hive in
      style!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1374640/extras/NormalOutfits_Small.gif?t=1608849450"

      no bee!

    review: This is a fun party game to play with your friends and family! The music
      is really well done and fits the theme well. The bee outfits are very creative
      and well designed. The user interface is very simple and it is really easy to
      set up or join a game. I had a lot of fun playing a few games of this and I
      am looking forward to playing more!
