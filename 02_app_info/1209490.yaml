    review: 'Any follow up to the amazing Enter The Gungeon was going to have a huge
      hurdle to jump to live up to the expectations, and that is very clear in Exit
      The Gungeon. Exit is not as tightly designed as its predecessor and suffers
      because of it, the jump dodge is incredibly overpowered and easy to abuse, and
      enemy bullet patterns are far more erratic than they used to be. The variety
      in weapons is lost when, not only are there significantly less weapons as it
      is, but some weapons don''t function as they used to. Now some weapons are simply
      weaker or stronger versions of other weapons you might get. I don''t mind the
      blessing system at all, but since the weapons aren''t unique anymore as long
      as you hold M1 towards your enemy you''ll keep doing damage. It''s not only
      the weapons that are limited now, but the enemies and items too. After only
      11 hours of play, I''ve seen almost everything Exit has to offer, Enter has
      10x as much content to see. Finally, for some reason a lot of the art in this
      game looks really strange compared to the much better looking style in Enter.


      That said, I am recommending this game. Even after all that, in a void Exit
      The Gungeon is a perfectly fine game, it just struggles to live up to the first.
      If you''re a fan of the original and you want to see how the story ends, it''s
      a solid 10 hour experience, just don''t expect it to be as good as Enter The
      Gungeon.'
