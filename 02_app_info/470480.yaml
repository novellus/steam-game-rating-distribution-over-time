      \ Express has a very cutesy artstyle, story and a surprisingly good OST, there\
      \ is nothing else that makes it a must play. The gameplay overall functions\
      \ and is fun, but it's very easy to lose momentum, which is not helped by multiple\
      \ unpredictable dead-ends. Of course you can get past them if you have a boost,\
      \ keyword being if. And to beat the story you have to go through it at least\
      \ 7 times, starting from the same stage every single time. A single playthrough\
      \ till one ending doesn't take very long, and when revisiting a stage you are\
      \ able to play only one of two to continue, but it does get tiresome to go through\
      \ the same stages over and over. The stage builder is a fun diversion, but online\
      \ capabilities are limited so don't expect to get too much use out if. Not to\
      \ mention how buggy the game is when it comes to completion/achievements. I\
      \ won't deny that I had my fun with this game, but I doubt I'll revisit it any\
      \ time soon.\n\n[h1]Join our growing Gaming Community![/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nepsgamingparadise]Nep's\
