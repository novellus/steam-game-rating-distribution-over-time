This is an OLD game and it was truly immersive for it's time. That being said, they never claimed to have remastered this game in really any way, so to expect phenomenal graphics is laughable. This is a very fun point and click game. Christmas themed (believe it or not) and tons of interesting things to see and take in along the way. Someone has mentioned some small form of racism within the game, and if it is the part I am thinking of- it is all in the eye of the beholder. Its a puzzle game from 1995 and there is absolutely NO reason not to play this game. Especially right now when people are thirsty for nostalgia and Christmas is right around the corner. Don't let negative reviews determine whether you will attempt a game or not- for I almost missed this gem due to Mr. \"I am going to change my handle because of this game\" and the numerous people who encouraged his comment. Give it a try and throw it back for yourself this Holiday Season :)","timestamp_created":1607897713,"timestamp_updated":1607897713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4loGLr/YCcJ/7uQI="}
