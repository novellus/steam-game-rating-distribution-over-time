    review: I bought the game on itch.io so I have more hours in than just on steam.
      The game is really well made and the story lines are creative and fun, a lot
      of work went into the game I can tell. Some of the secret story lines require
      crazy out of the box thinking so be prepared for that lol. Highly recommend.
