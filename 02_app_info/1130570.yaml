      \ sword to directly and indirectly influence the environment in order to overcome\
      \ obstacles and solve puzzles. While this mostly involves hacking things up\
      \ with the sword, violence doesn\u2019t solve everything. You\u2019ll have to\
      \ think outside the box and work with an unconventional and slimy ally."

    review: This is a fun little puzzle game that has a unique control method. There
      is only about an hour of gameplay but I highly recommend this game to anyone
      who is interested in game design or likes novel game concepts.
