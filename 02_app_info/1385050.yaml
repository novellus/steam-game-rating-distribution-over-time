    short_description: This Game is Trash. Yes, it's literal trash. You are a KEYBOARD
      and you ROLL on a UFO all the way to the END! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?? But
      seriously, can you make it to the end? Because it took us like 1000 tries. We
      counted. So play the game and see if you can. Your life depends on it now.
