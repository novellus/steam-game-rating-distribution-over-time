      \ /><br>Blasters of the Universe is the first of its kind, bringing the bullet\
      \ hell genre into first person VR. Build a bad-ass gun from thousands of combinations\
      \ then get ready to duck and dodge your way through a shit-ton of bullets in\
      \ this nostalgic \u2013 and nerve-wracking \u2013 VR Bullet Hell shooter for\
      \ the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490490/extras/bullet-hell.png?t=1564690570\"\
      \ /><br>You'll need to physically duck, dodge, twist, and turn your way through\
      \ hundreds of bullets. We scale the action dynamically to make use of the space\
      \ you have available, so the more you move around the better!<br><br>Like in\
      \ a traditional bullet hell game, the key to success is finding the 'sweet spot'\
      \ to be in while the onslaught of bullets flies toward you. The only thing that\
      \ can take damage in Blasters is your head. When you see a circle of bullets,\
      \ often the best thing to do is to keep your head right in the middle and let\
      \ the bullets breeze right by you.<br><br>You can also block bullets with your\
      \ shield as a last resort, but it's impossible to block everything. Avoidance\
      \ is the best strategy, so start moving around your play-space and dodge those\
      \ bullets!<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490490/extras/enemies.png?t=1564690570\"\
      \ /><br>You will encounter a variety of enemies within Blasters that you need\
      \ to dispatch. From fast moving ground enemies, to agile flying enemies, and\
      \ deadly lumbering tanks. Each enemy will pose a different threat level to you,\
      \ so you'll need to quickly identify what enemies are the most important to\
      \ destroy first.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490490/extras/boss-battles.png?t=1564690570\"\
      \ /><br>Blasters of the Universe features a 4 level Campaign for you to battle\
      \ through, each ending with an epic boss battle. In each level, you'll battle\
      \ new enemies, unlock new weapon parts and shields, and work your way towards\
      \ glory. Each level also features an Endless Mode where you can fight for a\
      \ high score on the leaderboards.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490490/extras/customization.png?t=1564690570\"\
      \ /><br>As you progress through the levels, you'll unlock new weapon parts to\
      \ take into battle. You can build a custom weapon that suits your play style\
      \ and the challenges you face. Want a super-fast firing hit-scan weapon that\
      \ deals poison damage to enemies? No problem. What about a scatter-shot cannon\
      \ that deals explosive damage and arcs shots towards nearby enemies? Can do.\
      \ With tens of thousands of unique combinations to choose from, you have the\
      \ ability to create a weapon that perfectly suits your style.<br><br><br><img\

      \ special ability that you can unleash to deal devastation to the enemies attacking\
      \ you and help turn the tides during an intense battle.<br><br>These specials\
      \ range from a bad-ass giant laser that melts anything it hits to a time-bubble\
      \ that slows everything down and gives you the upper hand for dodging incoming\
      \ bullets. Each special is unique and has different strengths that you can use\
      \ to your advantage.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490490/extras/challenge-modes.png?t=1564690570\"\

    short_description: Blasters of the Universe is the first of its kind, bringing
      the bullet hell genre into first person VR. Intense gameplay is heavily reliant
      on physical movement, requiring the player to duck, dodge, twist, turn, and
      maneuver their way through tons of enemies and hundreds of bullets.

    review: 'Oculus Rift CV1


      It''s a game with a simple yet nice presentation, graphics, animation, music
      it''s fine overall. The gampeplay is solid and although it''s rather a small
      game there''s a lot to experience between your modular gun, your different types
      of shields and ultimate abilities. The gun in particular has a total of 6 different
      parts which each affects a specific aspect of your gunplay, ammo type, shooting
      type, special effects, speed, magazine type etc and combined with the right
      shield selection it does play a big part in your performance so you''ll have
      to find out for each level what works the best for you.

      There is a daily challenge but the fat of the meat consists in a campaign of
      4 levels which you can play in Casual or Hell difficulty, there is also an endless
      mode to beat the best score. I only played the campaign in Hell difficulty and
      could beat it in 7.5 hours, don''t get me wrong it is challenging, each time
      you restarts a level you''ll get the same waves of ennemies but the patterns
      will slightly differ just enough to keep you on your toes so you can''t prefire
      everything that comes at you or dodge every bullets like if you already knew
      "how to dance".

      Considering the VR Arcade FPS genre, it has one of the best intensity / comfort
      ratio, meaning that your head will go scracth the floor to dodge bullets from
      time to time and sometimes you''ll be surprised and react violently to dodge
      but you won''t sweat like a sponge in your VR Helmet.

      Yes it is a small game but it''s a very good one I fully enjoyed it, it was
      great. The only thing that''s really lame is the Steam Achievment list, for
      once I wish I had something that shows that I beat the game in Hell mode because
      that was a real feat, I put a lot of energy to beat it. I beat it in hell but
      I know there''s still a big margin between my achievment and what can be done
      to top the scoreboard, I have not really forced myself to try every combination
      of gun module+shields+ultimate possible there probably is some OP build hidden
      in there.'
