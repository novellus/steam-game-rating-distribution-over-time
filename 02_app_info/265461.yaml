    review: 'Hello, I hope someone can answer this.


      In your readme it states:

      "may be used with any of ENTERBRAIN''s game development software (include all
      related titles of "RPG MAKER Series" or "our products") that retains the Company''s
      rights."

      Since RPG Maker MV is not developed/published by enterbrain, am I still allowed
      to sue this for MV?


      I love your music, I''d be sad to miss out on this for MV.'
