    review: 'Story:

      Well this is easy. There is none. An MMO has to have a purpose other than just
      run around and kill things. This can be improved on and needs to be acted upon
      fast.


      Soundtrack:

      The soundtrack is awesome! I''ll give you that. The chiptune sounds in this
      make the music stand out and feel like 4 NES consoles battling to produce the
      best sound. This is one of the only high points.


      Art / Sprite work:

      The sprites in this game are well drawn apart from the default main character.
      It''s a little bit too plain for my liking. You could''ve put a shirt and some
      pants on the guy and I would''ve liked it more but just plain white is kinda
      boring.


      Gameplay:

      The game controls poorly and has a weird "momentum" mechanic in it that changes
      your speed between two different settings. The first setting is really slow
      and the first setting makes you feel faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. The thing
      is weird and using E as the interact button really messed with my head because
      I was trying space bar and Z and X and everything. E was my last guess.


      POSITIVES -

      * Good Soundtrack

      * Decent Spritework

      * Great Server Connectivity


      NEGATIVES -

      * Poor Controls

      * No Story

      * Confusing Mechanics

      * Perspective Issues



      DISCLAIMER:

      This is just my opinion. You are free to have what ever opinions you like.'
