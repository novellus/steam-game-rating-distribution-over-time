    review: "It's a great game! I think the first chapter is the best and then it\
      \ goes downhill a little bit from there. The art is beautiful and the characters\
      \ are really cool. First chapter puzzles are also at a really nice difficulty\
      \ if you're just looking for a little bit of challenge, but still pretty simple.\
      \ \nAs others have said, in the final chapter there's a frustrating part where\
      \ you have to keep repeating a section in order to progress, and I think you\
      \ can mess it up by choosing the wrong dialogue options. I only messed it up\
      \ a couple times but it's still really dragged the game down a bit having to\
      \ repeat that several times. \nI finished the game in about 2 hours, it has\
      \ 3 chapters to play through.\nEither way, I think it's a game worth playing!\
      \ Interesting story too."
