    about_the_game: This is a game that integrates roguelike, adventure, auto chess,
      turn-based, strategy, and more.<h2 class="bb_tag">Roguelike</h2>Every map you
      enter is brand new. The monsters in each level game instance are randomly generated.
      Each card acquired in the initial game stage is random, and you can even get
      a purple hero directly at the beginning.<h2 class="bb_tag">Adventure</h2>There
      are many types of plots in the game for players to enter, including monsters,
      elite monsters, shops, lucky wizards, profiteers, purchasers, etc.<br>Each plot
      corresponds to a different function, and players need to make the best route
      selection based on their current conditions.<br>Planning ahead and thinking
      about the next few steps in advance will help you achieve the maximum benefit.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Battle</h2>The battle mode adopts rules similar to the auto chess
      gameplay. Monsters have different attributes, skills, occupations, etc.<br>Three
      or six different characters of the same profession play at the same time and
      connect to form a faction, which can trigger the unique professional skills
      of that faction.<br>In addition, collocating reasonable equipment for different
      characters is also one of the major features of the game.<br>The different coordination
      of characters, occupations, and equipment often causes some fantastic chemistry
      reactions in the battle lineup.<h2 class="bb_tag">Classic Lineup</h2>Chaser
      professions carry weapons such as poison darts and golden hatchet, which can
      break the restriction that ordinary attacks hit only one person, so as to attack
      repeatedly the rival lineup.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1425770/extras/demo1.gif?t=1608451833"
      /><br><br>The wizard profession carries equipment like a wizard's staff and
      a wizard's broom that triggers stuns and combo attacks, which can often prevent
      enemies from making moves.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1425770/extras/demo2.gif?t=1608451833"
      /><br><br>The assassin profession carries equipment with a high critical strike
      rate, which can break through the enemy's line of defense and completely defeat
      the enemy's rear line.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1425770/extras/demo3.gif?t=1608451833"
