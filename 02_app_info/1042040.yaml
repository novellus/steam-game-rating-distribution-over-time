    review: I dont know why but I dont get the rewards after clearing them. I wanted
      to be sure that I actually did clear them so I used a lot of time fighting them
      over and over again after they had been checked off as cleared (because Im dumb),
      but no. I got nothing so yeah, cant recommend this. I hope this is someting
      that will get fixed.
