Until after a couple easy and moderate levels I discovered a very limited and unbalance game. Tower ranges are poorly designed or maybe its the maps? Some towers on some maps can only be placed so close to the action, which is just barely in range enough to get off maybe one shot. \n\nPitiful economics and difficulty balancing. Even for a verteran of the genre and being one who welcomes a challenge, I found this TD game to be mediocre at best, and frequently more annoying than fun.","timestamp_created":1488718045,"timestamp_updated":1488718045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447761178016662598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49NOgz9oCcuHccw=="}
