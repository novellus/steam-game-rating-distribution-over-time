The price should be lowed for a game that is 7 years old and Activision is being money grabbers once again.\n\nThe campaign and zombies is good, but multiplayer isn't that great. It's dead and there is hackers in most lobbies.\n\nOverall Rating: 4.5./10\n\nPress F to pay respects\n","timestamp_created":1609525172,"timestamp_updated":1609525172,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8qLL3/YCfMO8vwI="}
