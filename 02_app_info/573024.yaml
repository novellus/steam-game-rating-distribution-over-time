    short_description: Izetta is powerful enough to fight whole armies, but her strength
      is limited. She can only use her abilities near certain ley lines, and outside
      them, she's no different than a normal girl. When the Germanian army attacks
      in a spot far from these ley lines, the duchy is forced into a corner.
