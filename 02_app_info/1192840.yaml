    review: 'So I don''t usually do reviews. But I really wanted to say something
      about this game.


      I was really pleasantly surprised with it. The characters are cute and likeable,
      the gameplay is fun, and the story takes some interesting turns. I liked how
      each area in the game looks different from the last and has different gimmicks.
      While a familiar loop became evident by the second area, the game kept throwing
      new things at me for the whole game so I never got bored. And the switching
      mechanic between the two heroes was cool and more important than just for combat.


      The voice acting did have some moments where the audio was a tad fuzzy, so it
      kinda took me outta the game when it happens (like maybe 3 times?). Also, some
      of the puzzles were really hard to figure out and were not obvious at all. But
      at least each level has this fairy that tells you how to do the puzzles if you
      talk to her. You just gotta pay a small amount of your ingame money. Most puzzles
      were okay tho.


      Pros:

      Good art

      Nice variation

      Good story

      Fresh gimmicks till the end

      Easy mode and Hard modes appreciated

      Secret Levels


      Cons:

      Audio a tad fuzzy sometimes

      Some puzzles almost require you to talk to Cloo and pay some ingame currency.

      Some more enemy types would have been nice


      Overall I''d happily give this game an 8/10.'
