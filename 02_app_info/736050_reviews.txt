The more imaginative you are, the more you will enjoy this game. The keener your eye, the more insight you will glean from your hand movements.\n\nI like to play the relaxed mode on the highest complexity and strive to perfectly trace the shape. Play your favorite music in the background and enjoy your training session.\n\nHappy hunting.","timestamp_created":1525906233,"timestamp_updated":1525906233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525691688060760498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46qrGo+MCea2AoAE="}
