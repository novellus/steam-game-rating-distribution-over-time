There is no gamepad support or options. There is no split-screen or online multiplayer. All of the single player modes are unlocked, so theres no challenges or anything.\n\nSo, the only reason to play, is for the gameplay itself. Which is awful too. There is no thrill. Its missing basic sound and particle effects like when you hit a wall. There's no sense of \"racing\". There isn't even a place indicator or minimap on the hud. The tracks tracks are really short. You'll be grinding on the walls because the game has literally the worst drift mechanic ever, and none of the cars turn fast enough to corner without it.\n\nOther than that, its pretty good, the tracks look nice, the graphics look nice, except for some of the car's accents look like vomit, and the music is pretty nice.\n\n","timestamp_created":1563140571,"timestamp_updated":1563140571,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ494ec+esCe7awzgE="}
