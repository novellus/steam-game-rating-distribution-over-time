    review: 'Don''t get me wrong. Your 1st set up of  this game could take up to 2
      hours of work, just based off the amount of time it took me to find the correct
      fix. But after I got everything to work i was happy. Other people are saying
      that it wont work with their modern amount of cores, but mine works perfectly
      after following the steps in the discussion I''ll put in the comments. I loved
      this game to death on Xbox and I''m going to start loving it again. Unfortunately
      there is no boss rush mode in this version. So the grind will be real. If you
      loved this game and are willing to put in a little trouble shooting then grab
      it. Coop is still a thing and 80% of the time I can find other games to play
      in. As for pvp. It''s pretty dead. You will have to coordinate in a group or
      discord or something to get a pvp match. In my biased opinion it''s still an
      8/10 game. I am excited to play this again. For $20 and knowing the fix that
      worked for me I would buy it again.
