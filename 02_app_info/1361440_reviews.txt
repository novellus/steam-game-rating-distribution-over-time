Your aim is a little off in perspective to where the gun is pointing at (with no rectangle, imagine KC:D bows). It requires a bit of practise, but it's actually pretty fun to play with, once you get used to it.\nYou can get upgrades in the store, including laser-aim for easier targeting too.","timestamp_created":1609548839,"timestamp_updated":1609585982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530671656131744385","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo5+z4fYCcvPIvwI="}
