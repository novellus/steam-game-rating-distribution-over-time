      /><br><br>The Crimson Hotel was built on the site of millionaire J. Blackwood's
      mansion in the late 1880's. While built as a luxury lodging, the hotel never
      truly saw a success until it's renovation in early 1920's. The hotel entered
      its golden years at the start of the 1930's and remained a staple of luxury
      accommodation until the late 1940's, when a series of accidents involving the
      Barker family, which ended with the death of its two children, plagued its reputation
      and caused the hotel to enter a steady decline and be shutdown and abandoned
      in 1954. While the children's deaths were deemed accidental in later years to
      come, it is said that Jane Barker, their mother, who had originally been named
      as prime suspect, never truly reconciled with the loss of her children. Despite
      the extensive news coverage and attention that this tragic story attracted,
      it is not known what happened to Mrs. Barker after her release from custody.<h2

    short_description: In 1949 two gruesome accidents tainted the Crimson's reputation
      and led to an innocent mother being charged with murder. Jane Barker hasn't
      been seen since her release in 1954. You're a group of teenagers on their way
      home from a party when your car breaks down outside the Crimson Hotel...
