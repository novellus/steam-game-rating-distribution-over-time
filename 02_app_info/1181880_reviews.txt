Got it during a sale but I'd say it's well worth the full price. My only gripe is that the battle music loop is a little repetitive, but that's easily dealt with by turning down the BGS volume.","timestamp_created":1580643086,"timestamp_updated":1580643286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510638296604156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1580771167,"developer_response":"I'm glad to see that you are enjoying the game! Thank you for the feedback. As such, there has been a recent update to add 5 more music tracks to non-boss encounters, picked at random. Hopefully this will help you feel that the battle music is less repetitive, as you should be hearing the original battle music 1/6th of the time now on average."}],"cursor":"AoJwv8/rgvACfJfh7wE="}
