I think I might've gotten another one in the past but that would've been years ago with similar issues which just made me give up on the game. I like the game that I can play it's really great, it's just unfortunate that whenever I try to play or download it, it just prompts me to another screen trying to get me to buy it again. Even though it says it's in my library. I'd recommend this if I could play it because I'm sure it's just as good as the original.","timestamp_created":1609719746,"timestamp_updated":1609719746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3cGx5fYCdoKfwAI="}
