    review: "Mit 18\u20AC ma\xDFlos \xFCberteuert, allerdings ist das Spiel auch nicht\
      \ so schlecht wie die Reviews es darstellen.\nEs ist halt ein Klick Game, wer\
      \ es mag wird Spa\xDF daran haben. \nWenn das Spiel im Sale f\xFCr unter 3-4\u20AC\
      \ zu haben ist und man Spa\xDF an solchen Spielen ist, ist es not bad.\nKleine\
      \ Review zu dem Game gibt es auf den Youtube Kanal PowerOfGaming"
