You run a coffee shop and the matches you make are used to fulfill customers' orders, wherein each order requires a certain quantity of various items.  Each customer has a certain amount of patience, and the longer it takes to fulfill their order, the more their patience decreases, and the less they will pay for their order.  As you make certain matches, \"treats\" appear on the board, and when you match these treats, it increases a customer's patience value..  You can also purchase treats which can be used at any time to increase a customer's patience.  This is where the light strategy elements come into play -- managing the patience level of each customer (up to four at a time) while you work to fulfill their order.\n\nThere are a total of 50 levels (\"days\", as the game refers to them) and it took me 7.9 hours to finish them, so I'd say it's well worth the price.\n\nIn my playthrough, I found only two potentially negative things.  First, the game does not support the Steam overlay.  Second, the store pages show the game in widescreen mode, but it actually runs in 4:3 aspect ratio (in windowed mode and in full-screen mode).  I don't see either of those as a big deal in this game, but I know some people do, so I wanted to point it out.\n\nIf you don't like match-3 games, or you don't like time-sensitive tasks and want relaxed games only, then this isn't for you.  However, if you like match-3 games and don't mind working against a clock, then I definitely recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1574555815,"timestamp_updated":1574660951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4venG0O4Cc4Kf3AE="}
