    review: 'Can only unlock in 2nd half of the game, a good 20 hours in give or take
      and even then you cannot mix and match furniture, it is one theme and one only.
      And you need to re-buy themes if you choose another.


      A big let down not able to pick what you want and having to rebuy each theme
      just to see it in-use again.

      It is not much to re-buy over and over but still a kick to little customisation
      you could of had.'
