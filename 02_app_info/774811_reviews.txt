While this game is very pretty and a little more fun than the original, it should have been more polished and thought through! Some puzzles do a fantastic job at showing not telling the directions, other puzzles are very hard and the camera angles/arrow key movement are hard to deal with if you use a keyboard. The block world is SUPER painful! Aside from that though, good game, probably a 6/10 but if you remove the block world entirely, 8/10! Loved the concept art and detail.","timestamp_created":1610089051,"timestamp_updated":1610089051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6ay8PYCe928wQI="}
