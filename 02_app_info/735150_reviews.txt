So i was somehow forced to buy it because he is only a faction here. I can feel for the appearances and his portraits' expressions that Mitsuhide is not treated as well as Nobunaga, but we all know Nobunaga and Mitsuhide were dutiful men confronted by destiny and circumstances. In resume, yes, I highly recommend this scenario, but should have been included with the base game.","timestamp_created":1594296026,"timestamp_updated":1594296026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwudjcmfMCcp6ElAI="}
