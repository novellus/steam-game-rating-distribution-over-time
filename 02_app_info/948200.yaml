    review: 'MIni Golf Buddies is, unfortunately, a perfect storm of all the elements
      that I hate in a game.  Music and sound effects are either on or off, no volume
      control.  Controls are reasonably straightforward, but on some holes the dividing
      line between success and disaster is both razor thin and unmarked.  Customization
      is minimal -- there is no option to run in a window rather than full screen,
      and it''s not a game that requires full screen for its blocky graphics.


      Most--and worst--of all, it stops you every few holes begging for a 5-star review;
      after the third one, I clicked on the option for 1-4 stars and rather than being
      allowed to leave a less-than-five-star rating, I was asked to email them with
      what I thought was wrong with it rather than being allowed to leave a rating.


      If you don''t want less-than-best reviews, [b]don''t ask for reviews[/b].  Not
      everyone''s going to love your game 100%; if you can''t deal with that concept,
      you''re in the wrong business.  And then [i]pretending[/i] to allow feedback,
      and then [i]only[/i] allowing the best possible feedback, is [b]dishonest[/b].


      There are better minigolf games out there.  I recommend all of those instead.'
