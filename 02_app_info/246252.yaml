    review: 'This is the last of the course DLCs, and while it adds two of them, I''d
      say it''s the most underwhelming of the DLCs. The courses themselves are really
      good (and challenging), but the fact that each course only includes the 5 minutes
      Score Attack and a Time Trial means they don''t end up adding a lot of content.


      I recommend it, but only as part of the bundle. Then again, I recommend all
      DLCs as part of the bundle, and not by themselves.'
