While smashable blocks [i]are[/i] there in plenty, the majority of the challenge comes from the huge roster of foes and their extremely well-animated attacks, which increase in number and swiftness with the jump to hard mode.  Normal is pretty dang easy on the whole -- almost [i]casual[/i] in spots -- so I would encourage veteran 2D gamers seeking a bigger bang for their buck to immediately go for hard after beating the base game; all bosses are noticeably beefed up, not with more life or attack power, but with trickier patterns and maneuvers, and this is objectively the [b]correct[/b] way to do such things.  Bravo! \n\nSince we're getting to a spot where the average Steam user has about 1000+ games in his library, the amount of attention the typical indie gets is plummeting like a cartoon anvil, with experiences that \"open up\" later frequently being discarded before they get a chance to shine.  On that note, I'd like to reassure anybody on the fence with this one that the depth and wildness of [i]Witcheye's[/i] invention [b]explodes[/b] after the first world, which is merely a fun, but admittedly staid training gauntlet -- so stick with it if you want to get into all the super-fun (and legitimately funny) stuff.  \n\nShort, clever, highly replayable, pretty as heck, bug-free, and with a crazy diversity of jazzy tunes, [i]Witcheye[/i] is worth it at full price, and an absolute steal on sale.","timestamp_created":1609610998,"timestamp_updated":1609616340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570871293544769287","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwoan4vYCdPbmvwI="}
