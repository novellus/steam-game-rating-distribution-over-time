Unfortunately, not better than ever. \n\nWhy? Well you see for all intents and purposes, this game lies to you yet again. \n\nIt tells you how you are a Gangsta Sniper. But you are in fact not a sniper. Aiming and shooting does not make you a sniper. It makes you a gun user.  Gangsta Gun User. Now I forgave the first game for it not having a sniper and allowed the developer to use that feedback to fix it in the sequel \"Gangsta Sniper 2:Revenge\". But when that game came out, there was nary a sniper rifle to be used in the game despite in the description that it said there WAS a sniper AND rifle. \n\nThere was not a single sniper rifle in the first two Gangstra Sniper games and I made it clear that I would not stand for this.\n\nThe developer has had THREE chances to fix this. They say that the third times the charm, but this is just lucky charms without marshmallows. And the cereal has been sitting out for five years. And the spoon is a sniper.\n\nDo not buy this game. It is a lie. Yo uare not a Gnagsta Sniper. You're a False God.\n\nYou will not be able to live your dreams as a Gangstya Sniper.","timestamp_created":1591056349,"timestamp_updated":1591056349,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544092953205108643","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49KaWufICebzWiwI="}
