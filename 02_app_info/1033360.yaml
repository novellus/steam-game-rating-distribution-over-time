    review: "It is a pretty rudimentary take on the tank battle game. \n\nThere's\
      \ no online mode so you're going to need to get a group of friends together\
      \ and you're going to need to hook up controllers to your pc if you want more\
      \ than one player so keep that in mind. \n\nOne of the more fun things to do\
      \ is if you can manage to flip a tank onto its front by pressing B on an xbox\
      \ controller than you can bullet hop by using the fire button.\n\nBeing only\
      \ a dollar means it is a fine pick up if you want a fun night with friends of\
      \ tank warfare. I suggest tipsy town as a fun map."
