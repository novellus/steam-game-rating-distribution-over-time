    review: 'have you ever wanted to oneshot dinosaurs that run the same path for
      all eternity?

      have you ever wanted to place three turrets to become immortal?

      you ever wanted to play a game so unbelievably broken its playable?

      this game is great if you want to die in two seconds of spawning in, or never
      die because you hit the turret limit for nothing gets through. or you could
      simply sprint like an infant that has eaten to much sugar but can maintain the
      speed.


      i have four hours in this game and i dont know why'
