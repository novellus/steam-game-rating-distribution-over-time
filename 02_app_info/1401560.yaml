    about_the_game: Kilta is a game about being a Guildmaster of a newly established
      guild. The guild accepts commissions and quests from all walks of life. A party
      needs to be dispatched to take on the challenges and earn glory and recognition,
      as well as hefty rewards for the guild.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Character_Banner.png?t=1606848189"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">GROW YOUR GUILD</h2>Recruit new guild members from a growing
      cast of heroes. All heroes are unique with their own characteristics, abilities,
      and dialogue. Should you recruit Rufus, the mighty macaque guardian that excels
      in traditional martial arts known to his people? Or Maryu, the heart-warming
      but savage old lady that can curse your opponents?<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Grow_Your_Guild_Optimized.gif?t=1606848189"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">STRATEGY IS KEY</h2>Always check what enemies your active
      party is going to face in the upcoming quests. By equipping better items and
      checking enemy compositions you can minimize your losses and always topple your
      foes. Try to find the perfect (or the most broken) combinations of heroes and
      items!<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Strategy_Is_Key_Optimized.gif?t=1606848189"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">ITEM MANAGEMENT</h2>Items are divided into weapons and
      equipment. Your job as the Guildmaster is to equip your heroes with whatever
      you have at hand. Items are earned through quests and occasionally through dialogue.
      There are no character-related restrictions on the items. You are free to experiment
      with different combinations of items and discover the most powerful builds.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">COMBAT</h2>The auto battling combat system delivers tactical
      and engaging action. At the beginning of each battle, it is important to consider
      the enemies, their abilities, and their formation, when positioning your heroes.
      The heroes will fight by themselves but your preparations will decide the outcome.
      In appearance, the battles offer explosive visuals, insanely good music, and
      cinematic camera action.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Combat_Optimized.gif?t=1606848189"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">BECOME THE BEST GUILDMASTER</h2>Every hero has a background
      that they may want to share with you. Most often the heroes are arguing by themselves
      and, in a way or another, it's up to you to resolve their conflicts. Some choices
      might lead to surprising outcomes that can even affect the results of the battles
      up ahead. Are you the caring and capable Guildmaster or do you swing to be the
      worst leader of them all?<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Become_the_Best_Guildmaster_Optimized.gif?t=1606848189"
