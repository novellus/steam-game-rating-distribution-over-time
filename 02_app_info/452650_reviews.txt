To be honest, that might be the only interesting thing about this game. Oh wait, you just know the main plot but not details, which gave this game a huge con as introduction.\n\nThere are three levels to play after installing, about 4-5 GB HDD space? First feeling I got about it, was, well, limited levels why? But then I thought it might provide a decent gameplay when starting one of the levels. Believe me, it didn't give me any good impression at all, the loading screen was misplaced at hell and it loaded extremely slowly in maybe 45 seconds.\n\nFirst level is located in a forest where you are hunted by a dinosaur (Tyrannosaurus Rex type) and some useless enemy NPCs like robots. Sure, they are trying to kill me, so I ran from them. The robots disappeared, but the dinosaur didn't. I decided to shoot at it a few times, but nothing happened. I got stuck and the dinosaur attacked me. I got hurt, and I thought I was killed in the game. That's what any of us would believe in this game, but no. You couldn't die EVEN THOUGH you are getting eaten by a dinosaur, and you can't hurt it with your weapons. So, great. I tested to jump, and my jump high was like a height of a mountain. Incredible, how bad level it was for not achievening anything.\n\nSecond level? A space station with, again, robots and some invicible soldiers with sci-fi themed weapons. I were being told in the game to do anything, but I couldn't because the enemies were just shooting at me and I couldn't kill them. Again as expected, as they couldn't kill me. After this level, I directly thought this game is a joke. But it felt impossible, it can't be that bad. That's where you and I was wrong until the last level.\n\nSo, third level you are supposed to be in a center of a city finding codes, for whatever I'm not been told for what for. I'm just standing there in the city, and fighting against same type of enemies. Robots and soldiers with transparent visibility. Now, why this is extremely bad, is because the map feels like a huge square, where the city is placed in the middle of it, and the rest where it doesn't belong, is outside the side, like extremely high growth grass, misplaced everywhere outside of the city. Now, the worst thing of this map, is the flashing details of buildings. Everything on the map looks extremely bad, worse than ugly. Weapons you can't use to kill enemies, and very bad focus on how to solve objective in a FPS game.\n\nThe conclusion of this game is, it's the worst game I've ever played since Guise Of The Wolf. Sure, GOTW has extremely bad graphics and is boring at times, but it surely is made to complete the game. This game, however, can't be defined as a completed game. There is nothing to do in this horrible game except getting hurt 24/7 without dying. The devloper of this game should be ashamed of making this game.\n\nAdvice: Don't even buy this game. It's a scam.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1538580873,"timestamp_updated":1538580873,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503759384155273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ48p+kneYCddP5qwE="}
