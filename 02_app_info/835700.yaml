    review: "This was my first time playing a hidden object game. I\u2019m a big fan\
      \ of point and click adventures and love puzzles so this was quite different,\
      \ but I still enjoyed playing it. There were lots of hidden objects to find,\
      \ some find 5 of a particular type of object, spot the difference puzzle and\
      \ a maze that was my favourite part of the game. Some of the hidden object scenes\
      \ have items that take a while to find. There is a hint system but I didn\u2019\
      t use it and so it took me about 5 hours to complete. I especially liked all\
      \ the additional information you could click on to learn more about the story\
      \ and author. I think I clicked on every one of these options (ok I\u2019m a\
      \ nerd, but I\u2019m willing to bet some of the information will show up on\
      \ Jeopardy at some point lol).  No bugs or glitches while I played (I\u2019\
      m running Windows 10). I would recommend this game if you get it on sale, as\
      \ a fun relaxing way to spend an afternoon."
