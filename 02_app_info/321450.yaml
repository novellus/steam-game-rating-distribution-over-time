    about_the_game: "Aquadelic GT is a boat racing game in the style of a kart racer\
      \ \u2013 easy to learn, but challenging to master. Enjoy piloting boats with\
      \ stunning physics. Whilst one is stable in every situation another can be hard\
      \ to control at speed. There are multiple paint-jobs for each boat, so you can\
      \ choose one you like. It is also possible to control bigger vessels like yachts\
      \ and cargo ships for relaxing leisure cruises. And one more thing... Use torpedoes,\
      \ rockets, mines and even jumping frogs to smash your opponents.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nAs a member of the Aquadelic GT league you will fight to win cash prizes\
      \ and the support of fans around the world, from the rivers of Russia and the\
      \ ports of Greece to luxurious Caribbean islands. You'll have to beat rival\
      \ racers to the finish, and it won't be easy as you're all armed to the teeth\
      \ with shark torpedos, dragnets, balloon bombs and exploding frogs!<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nAs your fame grows, you can land bigger and bigger sponsors \u2013\
      \ who will pay you even more money! You may be starting in a ramshackle old\
      \ tub of a boat, but in no time at all you'll be able to buy a fancy speedboat,\
      \ or a classy catamaran. Turn your newfound fame into money, and spend it to\
      \ buy lavish new homes. Why live in an apartment in Russia when you could buy\
      \ your own Caribbean mansion? Between races, you can move around the world looking\
      \ for sponsors, giving taxi rides, helping out people in need, or even going\
      \ for joyrides in seaplanes."
