Recommend getting this a little later in its development.\n\nThe in game controls to reload and hold weapons is a little questionable. Reloading them can be pretty frustrating. (Pulling the bolt back takes many tries if your hand motion isn't perfect, it reminds me of trying to get into the super speed glitch in skate 3). Also after pressing the button to make the zombies run at you in the second stage, the urge to reload faster amplifies this problem quite a lot for me.\n\nThe player teleportation is from what I can tell quite rough. I often find myself all of the sudden in a wall or a barrier that results in a completely dark screen. To get out of it, i have to move my head until I am able to see everything again to then teleport to a location. I also have to teleport many times to get into the correct position for each weapon so Id highly recommend making static (preset) positions so that everything is easily reachable. Without them, it takes a little time before I am able to reach everything.\n\nThe MP40 is firing from a closed bolt when it should be open and hence made some confusion when reloading. Regardless its easy to get used to.\n\nOther from its cons, it is a great starting point and has a large potential to be a great game. \nThe pistols are very fun to fire and use.\nThe graphics also are nice on the eyes and are pleasing to see.","timestamp_created":1565326358,"timestamp_updated":1565330335,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607201337814331055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40ay9uuwCeYaB0AE="}
