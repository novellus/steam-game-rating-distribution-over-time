It has a super cute art style, even if the MC has some clothing and other customization misaligning with their model. There are also more than two options for gender, which is great! Sadly the nonbinary/trans option just uses the feminine model and therefore can come off as excluding amab and/or more masculine nonbinary people (such as myself.) \nThe dialogue is cute and all the characters are distinct, making the dating and friendship aspects compelling. The design mini games are fun, even if not perfect in representing graphic design at all (another review describes specifics of this very well.) Overall it's very cute and enjoyable, a very standard visual novel in a very specific setting which serves it just fine.\n\nAnd now, the negatives:\nDear god, this game is buuuuuggy. A lot of customers have tuned in to tell the devs what specific problems they're experiencing, but next to none have been fixed, even months after release. \nOne of the big bugs that many experience is that your game gets stuck on the \"Value Proposition Canvas\" after finishing your assignment correctly, making it impossible to progress. Weirdly enough everyone seems to experience the problem at different points in the game, and thus it can be hard as a non-dev or person not experienced with programming to piece together exactly what's wrong.\nThere are numerous problems with the character customization. Many items are misaligned with the model and it can be hard to tell how the colouring (which mind you is already very limited) will look on an item. It also doesn't help how few items there are and how few can be colour customized in the first place.\nOverall the selection of both hair, clothing, makeup and faces is very poor and could have needed a bit more work before release. Now of course, it doesn't seem to have gotten any more work AFTER release.\nThe minigames are very simplistic and can feel a bit tedious, and even if it's not a bug it is a complaint people have. Apart from that there have been instances where both comic sans and papyrus were the correct fonts for an assignment. If you don't work in graphic design it can be hard to know exactly why, but these fonts are absolutely H A T E D. They are incredibly ugly, and no professional should ever use it for anything other than a joke (see Undertale for an example of a good joke on that.)\nA little adjustment that could be made with their choices of gender in the game. You should be able to choose pronouns (and multiple of them) seperately from choosing your body type (which I mentioned the problems with earlier.) There should also be more than two body types, but that could always come way later.\n\nI myself wish I hadn't spent this much money and time on this game, but I think I've just about rounded everything I wanted to critique. I hope this review was helpful. I would not recommend buying this game until you see more positive reviews and have tangible proof that at least the biggest things I and others have mentioned are fixed.","timestamp_created":1545419001,"timestamp_updated":1545419001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ytGJ6ecCe5r0tQE="}
