    review: 'There is some good and some bad in this dlc. UPDATE! The really bad parts
      have been changed back by the devs as they realized they made a mistake implementing
      those changes. I have marked (()) with old outdated information.


      Let''s start with the worst part..


      ((They removed the ability to convert territories UNLESS you''re in the muslim
      religious group and propagate religion. Its incredibly dull as that means 1
      world faith is pretty much just an Islamic thing and not a Hindu-Christian-Whatever
      thing unless you use gamey methods.))


      NEW INFO: Territories can be converted it just costs more and takes more time
      than cored states.


      Its mostly centered around India, which doesn''t usually play a big role in
      EU4 if you play outside of it, since nations WITHIN the subcontinent rarely
      if ever influence events outside of it from my experiences.


      The ''bonuses'' for chartering trade companies and investing in them are surprisingly
      lackluster and unless you have 10+ of them you don''t really get a major bonus
      that''ll give you power over your rivals.


      The good stuff:


      TRADE


      Natural harbors and inland centers of trade are now modifiable with 3 tiers.
      For European powers this means its quite possible to dominate trade in say;
      the English Channel without having to control both the netherlands and England.
      You can efficiently deal with one or the other.


      This is also true for Argentina and the Caribbean in the new world and India
      ofc in Asia. North America and Australia/New Zealand hasn''t gotten any buff
      and thus they''re nerfed trade wise in my opinion in the sense that you need
      to control a lot more provinces to control the trade.


      POLICIES


      Policies have been upgraded and is now easier for new players to utilize as
      the first 1 in each category is FREE. There''s also government reforms to make
      more free down the line which is great. The new  policies has seen some rework
      but nothing noteworthy.


      BUFFED IDEAGROUPS AND NERFED ONES.


      Exploration ideas have been buffed a lot especially for early and late game.
      Colonists can now be used to dev up your provinces for when there''s nothing
      else to colonize or you can''t colonize yet which makes the ideagroup even better
      than before. Expansion ideas have also been buffed slightly because of this
      too, and the policy you get for having both has been buffed aswell. Before you
      would recieve +20 colonists and now you get +20 colonists and -50% native uprising
      chance.


      ((Religious ideas have been nerfed a lot because missionaries have very little
      to do when territories can''t be converted. Humanism is undoubtedly the superior
      choice for any great empire.)) UPDATE: Religious ideas are now good again!


      GOVERNMENT REFORM.


      A much needed revamp but it doesn''t feel fleshed out enough in that the options
      are quite few, especially for theocracies. Republics are buffed in this, with
      the most ''tiers'' to go down. Hopefully they''ll work on adding more choices
      for all government types in the future as having just 2 choices kinda suck.
      (UPDATE) They have fleshed it.


      CONCLUSION


      The price they''re asking is high, its worth about half of that unless you''re
      a huge fan and you love to play India. Its not a needed DLC, but it isn''t completely
      useless either. (Like Mare Nostrum). If you are new to EU4 then get COMMON SENSE
      and ART OF WAR long before you even consider putting money into this one.


      (FYI) I consider what this newest patch and this DLC brought together rather
      than apart, as the price according to paradox is reflected in the amount of
      workhours put into both the free update and the DLC, It seems thus fair to me
      to judge it together.'
