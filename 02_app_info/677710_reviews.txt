Without any intro or story the game just feels empty. The graphics are very simple and the long respawn waiting period was tiring. Maybe it has a lot of content in the end and I feel a little bad to downvote after some minutes of play. It just felt to cheap though, just play any other decent non-VR side-scroller instead.","timestamp_created":1590435283,"timestamp_updated":1590435283,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g5DVpvICdO6gigI="}
