It is a typical tile puzzle throw away game. You're basically buying 60 cents worth of Steam achievements. Buy it on sale or not at all. \n\n--The nicest thing I can say about it is that the artwork style stands out among its peers. If you like your anime girls to look like airbrushed porcelain dolls, you're in luck here. I also appreciated that like many puzzle games of this type there is a solve button, so I only had to waste 20 minutes on this so-called game. \n\n--You can't even scroll through the picture gallery, you have to back out of each one individually. I won't be revisiting this one. It is one step above total garbage. Unless you are a collector of this fine genre save the 50-70 cents for a better game. Most of the top games in this category cost less than $5.","timestamp_created":1609382088,"timestamp_updated":1609382088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Lmp2/YCd+f8vgI="}
