It Rules  ! it has nice  Locomotives and Freight Cars. Along with  Different interchanges .  I Even have my own Railroad that runs on this Route Called the Southern and Erie. We use EX SP Motive Power !  NS Also Helps us move Shipments of Ore and  Coal .  Sadly I Have one complaint though.   I Noticed i started hearing Crackling sounds from the  Locomotives and Freight cars.  I Thought  it was  my Earbuds. But then I discovered that its the game.  Some of my other Add On s have the crackling noises to.  I Never had this issue when getting other Routes . If anyone  has had this problem  please let me know.  I Give this route 8/10!","timestamp_created":1566263133,"timestamp_updated":1566263133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50278550386428833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tNij1uwCdtrY0AE="}
