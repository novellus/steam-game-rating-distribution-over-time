How cute, I did too! ;3 Still, it's a fun game Atari 2600-style game where the rage is fun instead of frustrating, and probably one of the first games to be inspired by the current pandemic. Highly recommend for those who were excited about getting six on Flappy Bird. Getting 250 should be an achievement, just so we can see how many players got that far. Time for another go! :D","timestamp_created":1592338592,"timestamp_updated":1592338592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkNax3/ICeIS8jgI="}
