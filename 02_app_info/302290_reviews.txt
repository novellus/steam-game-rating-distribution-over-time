I found it very easy to do the tasks, there was no challenge at all. Also, the interaction part with the girls felt so shallow. I hope that the gameplay will improve in the next episodes, because really, there’s not so much to do even tho the characters are making a game. \n\nOh, and the art style is quite pretty. But the BGM is annoying, I had to turn it off because it’s basically the same song over and over again…\n\n3/10.","timestamp_created":1470784352,"timestamp_updated":1470784352,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.661600291728973389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8IXluNYCfpPOXg=="}
