    review: 'An excellent on field management sim of baseball! You won''t find trades
      or managing ticket and concession prices in this sim, this is about the on -the-field
      game itself, and the match-ups.


      Inevitably this game will be compared to OOTP, an excellent game in its own
      right. But OOTP is more about being a GM, and that is its strength. DDB is about
      being Tommy LaSorda, Sparky Anderson, or Billy Martin -- field generals. The
      options for the on field game are not as copious as OOTP, but do reflect the
      historical accuracy better, in my opinion. Every player that appeared in even
      one game for a team during the season is present on the roster.


      The game is very modable as well.


      TL;DR - Buy it! It is a wonderful hidden gem.  9/10'
