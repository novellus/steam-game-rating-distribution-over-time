      \ evening, he had taken up his childhood friend\u2019s invitation to have a\
      \ late-night picnic. He accepted, if only to subdue his boredom, and was encouraged\
      \ to wish upon the shooting stars that were a common spectacle in the town of\
      \ Hoshigino. During their picnic, a shooting star whisked across the sky and\
      \ he hurriedly wished for \u201Csomething fun and wondrous\u201D to occur in\
      \ his seemingly boring life.<br><br>To their surprise, stars began to trickle\
      \ down from the sky and quickly turned into a full-fledged meteor shower. Rather\
      \ than disappearing, the shooting stars seemed to have taken shape, aimed at\
      \ Hoshigino, and enveloped it in a warm, bright light. Once the light dissipated,\
      \ a single shooting star remained and barreled across the sky before ramming\
      \ straight into the empty, nearby hill.<br><br>From the cloud of dust, Takaya\
      \ and his chilldhood friend, Yua, discovered a rabbit-eared girl with white\
