    about_the_game: 'Anomalous entities escape from the research site in Russia, it''s
      up to you to escape or recontain the entities yourself. You''ll have to navigate
      the 3 sections of the facility all whilst evading the entities, known as SCPs.
      Every time you start a game, the spawns for guns and keycards (which you will
      need to open the next section) will be randomly generated. Each SCP will breach
      containment at a different, random time each game. If you die - try and try
      again.<br><br><strong><u>The main SCPs you will be facing-off are:</u></strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>SCP-173 - A concrete sculpture that can only move when it
      is out of your line of sight. As soon as you blink, it will hunt you down.<br></li><li>SCP-096
      - &quot;The Shy Guy&quot; will cry without stop. If you look at its face, it
      will go into emotional distress and scream, then attack the viewer. Nothing
      is known that can prevent the viewer''s death.<br></li><li>SCP-106 - &quot;The
      Old Man&quot; is a keter-class SCP, can walk through doors and teleport using

      dimension and kills them.<br></li><li>SCP-049 - &quot;The Plague Doctor&quot;
