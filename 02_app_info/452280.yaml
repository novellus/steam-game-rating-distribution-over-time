    about_the_game: <strong>Factorio</strong> is a game in which you build and maintain
      factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building
      infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning
      you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms
      and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial
      powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and
      deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs.
      However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely
      with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your
      machine empire. <br><br>Join forces with other players in cooperative <strong>Multiplayer</strong>,
      create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends.
      Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete
      game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up <strong>Modding support</strong> has allowed
      content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative
      features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there
      are a range of interesting challenges in the form of the <strong>Scenario pack</strong>,
      available as free DLC. If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you
      can create your own with the in-game <strong>Map Editor</strong>, place down
      entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom
      script to make for interesting gameplay.<br><br><strong>Discount Disclaimer:</strong>
      We don't have any plans to take part in a sale or to reduce the price for the
      foreseeable future.<h2 class="bb_tag">What people say about Factorio</h2><br><ul
