    review: Enjoyable puzzles and characters and lovely environment. The only downside
      is shared with most VR puzzle games- it is fairly short compared to its 2D cousins.
      My first playthrough was about 80 minutes, and I found the play very smooth
      due to playing a lot of similar games, so that is likely on the shorter side.
      Determine for yourself whether that means this is a full-price or on-sale buy.
      I am about to play it again, despite the fact that I know it will be the same
      puzzles, for what that's worth. Enjoy!
