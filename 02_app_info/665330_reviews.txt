This is a surprisingly fleshed out wrestling game. This literally has more features than the modern WWE2k games. \n\nYes, the graphics look like they came from a 1999 game but they're charming. \n\nI sorta passes for a retro title, the gameplay is fun, the customization is endless, there's alrerady hundreds of characters on the rosters without mods or anything. \n\nSolid wrestling title.","timestamp_created":1609749654,"timestamp_updated":1609749654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn82j5vYCdK6qwAI="}
