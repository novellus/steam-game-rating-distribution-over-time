      warriors as possible. In addition to the danger of being defeated, the hero
      risks falling into the abyss and losing accumulated honor points. The hero is

      both strike with a sword and shoot from a crossbow, trying to throw a brave
      knight into the abyss.

    review: '47 Cent for 12 minutes of fun. At level 5 or 6 you just can''t get any
      further.

      Sorry, but 4 Cent per minute of fun, is a bit too much.


      It is fun for a little while, but after playing nearly the same level all the
      time, it just gets repetetive.'
