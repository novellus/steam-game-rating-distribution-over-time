New races are fantastic.  Well voiced and full of charisma.  I wish every game had the budget to voice characters as well as this.  Get it in the multipack for $10 as opposed to individually to save money.  I'm just going to cut and paste this review for all 3 since I really think they all go together.","timestamp_created":1480689811,"timestamp_updated":1480689811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":57,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492680788040161133","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446//39gCdJOsaw=="}
