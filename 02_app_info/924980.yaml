    review: This is a fun RPG with lots of action and very little exposition. It only
      took me about 25 hours to beat, but it was all killer, no filler. Each of the
      6 characters has their own story, so it seems pretty replayable. I liked that
      the party you choose seems to make some big changes to the story. The class
      changing and skill systems were fun to tinker around with too. However, be warned,
      this game is VERY easy. RPG veterans might want to raise the difficulty a notch
      even on the first playthrough.
