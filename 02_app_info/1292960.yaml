    review: "I've finished the game haven't gotten the achievements yet as there's\
      \ randomness for that, but I quite like the game.\n\nThe art is nice, the animations\
      \ make each image feel a bit more alive as you go through a fairly simple storybook\
      \ story. It's a bit short, but I don't personally mind that given the price.\
      \ The only real criticism that I have gameplay wise is that you cannot grab\
      \ objects that are not on the bottom of the screen yet. Forcing you to remember\
      \ where it all is as you search for specific items first. I just find that an\
      \ odd choice. \n\nAnd aside from that the UI is really obnoxiously huge. It\
      \ distracts away from the really nice artwork. Especially the home button. I\
      \ assume they're made this way for children, but at least giving an option would\
      \ be nice. I'd rather a collapsable menu that shows everything to find rather\
      \ than just 5 at a time. But that's more a personal preference I suppose.\n\n\
      Oh, and more of an issue is that some of the icons do not accurately reflect\
      \ the object within the game itself. There's a bike horn for instance, in the\
      \ image itself it's elongated and looks like a bike horn. In the circle that\
      \ requests it, it looks almost identical to a pawn chess piece that the same\
      \ level can ask you to find, just turned on it's side. There are quite a few\
      \ instances of clicking on something that doesn't really look like the image\
      \ that it pairs to.\n\nAnd I don't want to be mean to the narrator actress,\
      \ but it's a bit rough. The acting itself I wouldn't mind as much if the audio\
      \ quality itself wasn't terrible. I usually don't even notice these things since\
      \ I don't even have an audio setup. It's just really poor quality. \n\nThe game\
      \ is pretty easy / liberal on hints. There's just a minor cooldown and the hint\
      \ itself is literally just a reveal of where the object is. That's not really\
      \ a negative or positive to me, just something of note. In spite of a few minor\
      \ issues and nit picks, I think it's a neat little hidden object game. And well\
      \ worth the incredibly low price."
