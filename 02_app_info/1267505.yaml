      \ configuration is now available for Train Simulator duty wearing Norfolk Southern\u2019\
      s distinctive livery.<br><br>The GP50 diesel road-switcher was the successor\
      \ to Electro-Motive\u2019s successful GP40-2 and the precursor to EMD\u2019\
      s GP60, the latter of which helped introduce the builder\u2019s 710-series power\
      \ plant and \u201C60-Series\u201D locomotives. As such, the GP50 represented\
      \ the final technology push for Electro-Motive\u2019s 645-series V-16 turbocharged\

      s \u201C60-Series\u201D locomotives, the GP50 was predestined to be a transitional\
      \ model. Nonetheless, the GP50 recorded a five-year production run (1980-1985)\
      \ and 278 units were constructed for five buyers. Southern Railway was the purchaser\
      \ of the largest fleet of GP50s with a total of 90 units. Santa Fe, Chicago\

      \ NS initially continued to use the GP50s in priorities services but, as typical\

    review: I like the model, I like the sounds. Textures could be better, but otherwise
      a solid engine. Certainly better than anything Dovetail can do, but then that's
      an extremely low bar.
