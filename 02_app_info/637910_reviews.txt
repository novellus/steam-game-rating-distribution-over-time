This soundtrack really makes me believe it fits with the older, retro-electronica era of the 80s and 90s. When coupled with the graphics and gameplay it makes me feel like I'm playing a video game from that same time period. To the composer: you did a stellar job with this set, and must be so proud. â™¥","timestamp_created":1502119276,"timestamp_updated":1502119276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qXS3t0CfbqCggE="}
