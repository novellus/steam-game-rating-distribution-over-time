Like I fell pretty deep-- and while the pages are not that long, kind of simple, I feel like I got a really big personality feel playing this game overall. In quarantine I feel like it definetly brought me a few hours of joy and laughter where I forgot about everything. I see a lot of other reviews here of some people who also feel really almost emotional about this silly adventure game. I think they hit the nail on the head writing wise in a weird way where I honestly couldn't tell you why. \n\nAnd that SQUISHERS song may never leave my head, please help me.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609895106,"timestamp_updated":1609895106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3brO6vYCc6zvwAI="}
