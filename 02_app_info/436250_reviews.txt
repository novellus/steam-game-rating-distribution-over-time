The campaign guide for example is mostly copied text put in an appendix. Locations are not pins on the maps as in other modules. Major NPCs are inside this story notes which make it harder to find them instead of having each as a story note in a NPC group. Even in story notes about 'meeting with x' is not the NPC linked.\nSome text from the book is also missing but mostly about things outside the adventure location.\nThe book only comes with one battle maps why the module also only have one battle map.\nThe XP from some of the encounters is wrong, about 3-4 times higher than similar creature in SRD. For example the 'human warrior' which have stats like a 'bandit' has CR 1 XP 200 while bandit in SRD has CR 1/8 XP 25. But has the same XP if the creature can be find in the SRD. This because they use the original stats from D&D Next Playtest. You might want to change these first otherwise the players might get confused then a thug gives the same XP as a big monster.\nThe chapters are made up just as in the book and I think would be an easier read if one hade adjusted to be read in FG. At least I find it hard to follow how the story unfolds. Not for I know how to do it better...\nAnother thing that is exactly as in the book is the random encounter tables. Even the text about the percentage that an encounter will happen is there. Like 'Encounter chance: 30% per hour\" then a d10 table with encounters. Why not use the power of FG and and make 70% of the table no encounter. Why should I roll twice?\n\nOtherwise it's a nice adventure but as DM you need prep time - don't expect to pick this up and play the same day.","timestamp_created":1513682741,"timestamp_updated":1513682741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.779691100120544434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48LSht+ACdvbLkgE="}
