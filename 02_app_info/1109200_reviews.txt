(There are towns, industrial zones, train yards which shouldn't be silent irl. The whole map just feels [u] dead[/u])\n\nI like the idea of the map, it is quite interesting to make a fictional route for some sort of freight and passeger services. But the route right now doesn't feel, like done, and you need to make it better by yourself in editor (SERIOUSLY? For the money you paid for the route? How would you like to buy raw meat at the market, for the price of the cooked one, in order to cook it by yourself?). \nThere is a lot to correct there.\nDon't buy it, unless you want to waste your money on unfinished route.","timestamp_created":1581942678,"timestamp_updated":1582362362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.685628712177276611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwibCJtvACeqHv8gE="}
