    review: Great game, has a lot of replay value and the soundtrack and visuals are
      charming as well. This game deserves more attention. It's easy to play but  hard
      to master and has many different ways to play. If you like strategy, RPG, rouge-like
      or card battler games than this is something you should at the very least try.
