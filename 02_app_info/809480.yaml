      is something more sinister occurring on asteroid 624-VL?<br><br>Zap, Blast,

    review: 'Shows some promise, though only for those that dont mind getting in early.


      First impressions are OK with mouse and keyboard.  Clean, no bugs encountered.


      I think it probably costs a little too high right now in early access.


      Lack of enemy variety, behavior, and just general lack of content.'
