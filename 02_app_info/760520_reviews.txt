Really sad to have to request a refund on this one.\n\nZero interaction... 100% VR animated film... which would be fine, but the film isn't that great. The entire movie is 12 minutes long and the storyline just isn't engaging. Additionally, the animation quality is choppy and the voice actor audio is of terrible quality... it sounds like it was recorded on a cellphone from a bathroom stall. The music soundtrack seems to cut in and out randomly and ends in hard cuts rather than transistioning nicely from piece to piece.\n\nThe one highlight is the main character and set designs... really cute with a lot of potential, but they're wasted on the poor animation and delivery. None of the characters have any life or detail to their animation.\n\nDevs... please put some polish on this and maybe I'll revisit. I'd love to fund your further efforts, but this doesn't show the attention to detail that's going to be neccessary for you to succeed.","timestamp_created":1522855819,"timestamp_updated":1522855819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.661711633205413818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47/bRyOICcfS3nQE="}
