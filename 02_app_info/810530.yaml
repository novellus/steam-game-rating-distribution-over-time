    review: "[h1]Easy blue thumbs up! If you've never listened to this soundtrack\
      \ from the game, the music WILL grow on you I promise![/h1]\n\nWhen I first\
      \ started playing The Void Rains Upon Her Heart, I didn't really know what to\
      \ think about the game's music. It didn't help that you are limited to a few\
      \ songs until you start unlocking more so I wasn't able to gauge accurately\
      \ right away. However, the more I played the game, the more songs I unlocked\
      \ and the more I realized that while the music is a little funky and at times\
      \ whimsical--it was something I really enjoyed and wanted more of.\n\nThe more\
      \ I played, the more I fell in LOVE with the game and it's amazing music--so\
      \ much so that I began to feel guilty! LOL I went ahead and bought the soundtrack\
      \ as a token of gratitude towards the awesome dev (got it on sale for less than\
      \ a buck) and I also left one of the best reviews I possibly could for the game\
      \ https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZeroAffex/recommended/790060/. \n\n[i]Which\
      \ by the way if somehow you've stumbled upon the soundtrack for the game BEFORE\
      \ seeing the actual game storefront--It's GOOD, I mean.. REALLY GOOD. Go check\
      \ out the store page and read the testimonials to see what others are saying.\
      \ Better yet, buy it and be your own judge![/i] :D \n\nUltimately--If you like\
      \ weird, sci-fi, lo-fi, whimsical, retro 8 bit music then look no further! You\
      \ have a good variety here to enjoy and it only cost $4 (it's on sale for $.79\
      \ cents right now!). It's a screaming deal for a soundtrack to add to your collection,\
      \ you can't go wrong! \n\n[h1]Easy recommendation right here. This music is\
      \ awesome and the price is great. Support this dev! Love some monsters! Love\
      \ yourself! Your wallet will love you--after you buy this! Your wallet will\
      \ REALLY love you after you buy this and the game! So much LOVE to be had![/h1]"
