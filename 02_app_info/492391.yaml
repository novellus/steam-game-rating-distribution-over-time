    review: When I  first dicovered the Choice games I thouught, as an avid reader,
      I had found a genre that I could very much enjoy. After trying a fair number
      of these interactive stories I think they are just artless garbage written with
      the sole purpose to make a quick buck and they just keep getting worse. I won't
      be buying any more.
