      \ by the sentiments taking us back to the 2000\u2019s.  <br>- The graphics of\
      \ the game locations is dark. <br>- It is a true \u0410RPG with roguelike elements.\
      \ <br>- There are three types of the characters and advanced crafting. <br>-\
      \ You will have dozens of skills based on the Power of Blood. <br>- The game\
      \ has 21 levels of dungeons with random world generation.<br>-  A magic painting\
      \ depicting the Royal castle. One can move there from any location and relive,\
      \ improve the workshops and craft the weapon, armours, potions, combat scrolls\
      \ and everything that helps you survive. All this is accompanied by sweet sounds\
      \ of guitar strings. <br>- Galidon is a powerful vampire kingdom. You are a\
      \ lawful heir to the throne. The power struggle and an intriguing plot are in\
      \ place.<br>- Each level contains quests.<br>- The gameplay is rapid, bloodthirsty\

    review: "This is a rogue game, you cannot save, you will have to go through 21\
      \ levels, if you die, you will start again. There was some auto save, but it\
      \ didn't load. \nIt does have nice UI and crafting panel is interesting, it\
      \ is nice you have 3 classes to choose from, but the mage didn't feel like mage,\
      \ so I didn't feel any desire to pick up another one. \nBut the levels and music\
      \ which are much more important for me in isometric games are generic and boring,\
      \ enemies attacks and design are very basic, the camera turning is too slow\
      \ and there is no way of customizing your keys, so you don't even know which\
      \ one you can use. \nI went into 2nd level and then  died to some sort of bosses\
      \ right next to the door, then I gave up. \n"
