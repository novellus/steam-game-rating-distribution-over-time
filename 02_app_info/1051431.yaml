    review: 'This package comes with the tilesets for VX Ace and MV.


      Problem: The MV version is just scaled up from VX Ace in terms of size only,
      which it was originally designed for, so unfortunately comes across as grainy
      and messy. It doesn''t mes with MV graphics at all, whether you incorporate
      from other tile sets to match or even the character sprites.


      It works great for VX Ace, however!


      My advice: Only buy it if you want to use it with VX Ace. Do NOT waste your
      money if you only want to use with RPG Maker MV.'
