Controls were a little confusing in the beginning but once working it out, it all flowed on pretty nicely from there. The recent updates to the game have made it much more user friendly and a bit easier to begin now with shields and more on screen view. Looking ahead to the future of this game I'm looking forward to some pvp action with/against from friends. It has a ladder board with all players that have ever done a game so its really fun to try and beat your own record and everyone else that has every played it.\n\nI definietly recommened this game for something to play in your down time and to try and reach the top of the point ladder board!","timestamp_created":1507615939,"timestamp_updated":1507615939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m7O6gt8CeKrshwE="}
