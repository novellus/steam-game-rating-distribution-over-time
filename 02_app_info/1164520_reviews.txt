While we would prefer that people having an issue report it to us so that we can address it and respond back to you, everyone is entitled to their own course of actions. One issue addressed in this review (the action keys) had already been resolved, but our help screens did not reflect this. We have corrected those screens. While this review did not include running through our training level, we have added a training video to our main page. Playing through this training level would have explained things about murderers such as killing an innocent person you encounter (who is not carrying a weapon) will brand you as a murderer. A book in the training level (as well as the library) will explain how to correct your misdeeds. While we didnâ€™t find sound effects to be too loud, we have our volume turned to a comfortable level. If anyone finds specific sounds that are out of balance, please let us know so that we can correct them.\n\nWe appreciate all feedback and will continue to work to correct any reported issues. May the Holy Yorle be with you always.\n"}],"cursor":"AoJwof3Wi+4CfqGU1QE="}
