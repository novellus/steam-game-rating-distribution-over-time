    review: "I have to say this game is very realistic. You can tell it's not your\
      \ typical pixelated VR game.\nIt's very hard to even score in this game and\
      \ the bouncing could be a lot better.\n\nThat having said I spent a good few\
      \ minutes playing this game! Sadly it's not something you could play for hours.\
      \ However if it would be possible to make this game multiplayer? In the sense\
      \ that friends of yours can join in and have fun. I wasn't exactly talking about\
      \ random online people. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game. Definitely worth\
      \ a try!\n\n8/10 + 0.1 for being a free game."
