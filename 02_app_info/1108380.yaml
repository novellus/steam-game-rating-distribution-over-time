    review: 'I really liked this game, it makes even a dumb idiot like me think outside
      of the box and it promotes thought,

      it tackles the issues of the modern day media and for me personally it hit a
      soft spot on the subject of depression linked to social media. i''d suggest
      this game to anyone who wants some food for thought and a cute well put together
      small game that doesn''t take up much of your time but will stay with you for
      a long while'
