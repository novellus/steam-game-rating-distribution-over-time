Almost feels like a flash game, but updated with 3D graphics, physics and online support.\n\nPROS:\n- Fun gameplay loop that's a little bit different every time\n- Difficulty increases as you play, \"finishing\" a level is actually very difficult but at the same time it doesn't take forever to master\n- You can do multiplayer with people that don't own the game, by sharing the keyboard or using 2 controllers, and you can do this over the internet with steam remote play\n\nCONS:\n- Amount of content is exactly what you see in the trailer. It's infinitely replayable but beyond increasing your own skill it's not very deep\n\nOverall I had a great time with this game and I think it's worth the price, especially if it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1594076750,"timestamp_updated":1594076750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5yYk/MCctuykwI="}
