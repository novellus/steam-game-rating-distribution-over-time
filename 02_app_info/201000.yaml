    review: "Geneforge 4\nTo be honest at first I didn't quite like this one. The\
      \ game forces you to be a rebel and that somewhat took me out of the experience.\
      \ Yes, the new classes are fine (except the servile which I doubt any self-respecting\
      \ person will roleplay as), even those lifecrafters are basically shapers. New\
      \ creations were good too, not as original as the ones from G2, but nicely designed\
      \ and efficient (as all real Shaper work). But, as plot went on I enjoyed it\
      \ a lot more. Being a double agent is an interesting experience, even though\
      \ it wasn't always handled well (in my humble opinion) and the returning characters\
      \ (namely Alwan and Greta) are nice too see. \nThe overall gameplay had a few\
      \ minor improvements again and while the story is not that original (Shapers\
      \ vs Rebellion again, albeit on a bigger scale) this game was well-worth those\
      \ 33.9 hours it took me on the first walkthrough (the shortest so far, even\
      \ though I, once again, skipped some side quests and probably missed few hidden\
      \ places).  Also, it has some replayability, a bit less then G3 though."
