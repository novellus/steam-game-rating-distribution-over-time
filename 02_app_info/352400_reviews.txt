The savage aspect of the dinosaurs is softened by things that could only happen in the LEGO universe and the stories suffer some minor changes, obviously. First, this game offers you the possibility to play as a character (to dig through piles of dinosaur droppings as Ellie Sattle, to play as Dr. Ian Malcolm using his classic flare gun, and to scream playing as Lex Murphy are the trio that sold me the game since the beginning) and then you get excited when you discover you can also play as a dinosaur. There are a lot of vehicles from the movies; but who cares about that when you can play as a triceratops? In general, this game is very funny and the unforgettable Jurassic Park theme song just contributes to make it almost perfect. I say almost because the loading screens mix fictional facts from the movie with real ones and it's confusing; also, they take an eternity to load and, when you are a completionist, they are just too much.","timestamp_created":1610040098,"timestamp_updated":1610040098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzcf37vYCc7ipwQI="}
