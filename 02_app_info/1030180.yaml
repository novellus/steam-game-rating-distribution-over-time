    review: i love the Dark Tales series, you get to solve cases with your detective
      friend and explore a lot of beautifully crafted areas. the characters are all
      voiced acted, except you. a lot of time and effort as been put into these games
      by the creators. steam is missing the first two games as well as few others
      which i forget the names of, which is a little disappointing because The Premature
      Burial is the third game in this series. hopefully they will be added at some
      point in the future
