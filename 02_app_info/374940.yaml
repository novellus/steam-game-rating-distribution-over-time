    about_the_game: "Land your troops on the beaches of northern France, lay bridges\
      \ to cross flooded enemy defences, avoid tanktraps, clear the area of dangerous\
      \ minefields, overcome the enemy and claim the beachhead for the Allies! Tank\
      \ Battle: Normandy is an historical wargame themed around the Allied invasion\
      \ of Axis held in Europe on the 6th of June, 1944. Play as the Allies, British\
      \ or Americans as many new units enter the theatre for the first time. Or, play\
      \ as the Germans as they use their impressive arrays of heavy tanks, bunker\
      \ emplacements and artillery to repel the invasion forces. The invasion missions\
      \ are a careful recreation of the naval landings at Omaha, Utah, Sword and Gold\
      \ beaches. The other missions are a mixture of themed and historical battles\
      \ that challenge even the most skilled wargamers. From the lush and forested\
      \ bocage and fortified beaches of Northern France where tank is king, to tight\
      \ urban environs where infantry units can rule all, Tank Battle: Normandy requires\
      \ the player to be at the top of their game! Enjoy Airborne Landings, bridge-laying\
      \ tanks, mine-clearing tanks, bunker assaulting AVRE\u2019s, Fireflies and Kangaroo\u2019\
      s. Typical mission objectives include; escorting units, holding positions, capturing\
      \ points, repairing units and, the ever-popular, destroy the enemy army. The\
      \ game system represents a major upgrade of the already successful engine used\
      \ throughout the Tank Battle series and enjoys a number of new features and\
      \ refinements."

    review: Nice clean little game.  A few things I'd tweak like having it center
      on the units the AI is shooting at so you can watch it as it unfolds if you
      prefer.  Reminds me a little of a bite sized version of Steel Panthers from
      back in the day.
