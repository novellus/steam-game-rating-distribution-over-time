This gives you a total of 55 different playstyles, and depending on the order you select your clan, 95 different character appearances.\n\nEach class has a passive and 4 skills. Rather than being key-bound skills go into a skill deck and once your mana is full, one randomly becomes available. This means you can choose to select a single class to narrow down your skill deck, but forgo a second passive.\n\nThe combat itself is good. Mana generates slowly at first (and the rate seems to be different for different clans) but will generate faster in combat, and passively regenerate faster the longer the match continues. This manages the pace of matches excellently.\n\nThe lack of control over which skills you get when also works surprisingly well. One would expect this to reduce your capacity to strategise, but this is not the case. Not only are you forced to adapt to the skill that becomes available, but you are also left with the choice of waiting to trigger it at the perfect time or triggering it at a sub-optimal time and hoping for the best in order to begin the charge up of the next skill.\n\nBalancing is quite good. Due to the single skill at any given time mechanic, syneries between two clans are limited. This means that instead of 55 permeations requiring specific balancing, there is only really 10. As is the case with every game with different classes, the balancing is not perfect, but as of yet I have not encountered any significant balancing issues.\n\nThe biggest drawback this game currently has is the two player limit. This is a shame, as it appears perfect for 4 players. Hopefully this is a feature the developers will add in the future.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/","timestamp_created":1504393590,"timestamp_updated":1520819095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638633370399475098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43bj4i+ICeJauhAE="}
