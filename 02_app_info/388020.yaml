    about_the_game: "The Syrian Civil War started with the Arab Spring in early 2011\
      \ but has only become more and more complex since then.With international tensions\
      \ high, and so many players maneuvering in a very small space, it is amazing\
      \ that the conflict has not overflowed into a general regional or even global\
      \ war. <br><br>The two most likely protagonists in any escalation are Russia\
      \ and Turkey, countries with many long standing differences of opinion and grudges\
      \ against each other. In this scenario you play either Russia or Turkey as you\
      \ attempt to maintain national honour and pride while keeping any hostilities\
      \ limited. Complicating your efforts are US, Coalition, Syrian, ISIS and Rebel\
      \ forces. Winning is not always a matter of causing casualties. <br><br><a href=\"\

      \ /></a><br><br><strong>Side Brief \u2013 Turkey </strong><br><br>Another hot\
      \ and hazy summer day in Southeastern Turkey. You are the commander of the 10th\
      \ wing of the air force and are charged with securing Turkish airspace from\
      \ any violations. Your forces consist of two F-16 squadron based at Diyarbak\u0131\
      r and one F-4 Squadron at Malatya Erha\xE7. Supporting the Coalition but not\
      \ under your control are two tankers and a new 737 Wedgtail working out of Incirlik.\
      \ You are also aware of a navy frigate and submarine off the coast which you\
      \ have been told are yours to command if you need them. <br><br>The coalition\
      \ forces in your area, mostly US, British, French and German have informed your\
      \ staff that they will be flying against rebel targets in northern Syria today,\
      \ some have cleared airspace but they are not usually a problem. Indeed, many\
      \ are based at Incirlik and you have instructions to accommodate them as much\
      \ as possible. On the other hand, the Russians do not have authority to cross\
      \ the border, and they will likely push that limit. Tensions with them have\
      \ steadily increased since we shot down the Su-24 for violating our airspace\
      \ last November! The Syrians are not usually an issue, they cower in their bases\
      \ and wait for the Russians to do the dirty work. <br><br>Your task today, as\
      \ every day, is to ensure that our airspace is not violated, particularly by\
      \ the Russians!<br><br>But you\u2019re not allowed to start a war on your own\
      \ \u2013 you must use non-lethal means unless given authority, the government\
      \ is a little touchy on that point! As well; you should use your F-4\u2019s\
      \ to bomb some Kurdish forces as payback for the damage the Russians are doing\
      \ to the Turkoman Brigades. <br><br>Stay safe and keep things calm! <br><br><strong>Side\
      \ Brief \u2013 Russia </strong><br><br>As the Commander of the Russian Forces\
      \ in Syria you review your situation: <br><br>The weather today is hot and somewhat\
      \ hazy. Your forces represent the best in the Russian military, a mix of over\
      \ 40 aircraft from the most modern fighters to unmanned surveillance drones,\
      \ the best SAM system in the world, two of the quietest submarines available\
      \ and one of the most potent ships afloat patrolling off the coast. Still, you\
      \ are surrounded, vulnerable and outnumbered. <br><br>Your primary task is to\
      \ support the Syrians and help them win this interminable civil war; you can\
      \ do that by destroying ISIS and the western supported or non-aligned rebels\
      \ and by supporting the Kurdish and Syrian forces in the north. However, you\
      \ must always be on your guard should NATO, and especially Turkey become provocative.\
      \ So far the Americans and Europeans have the power, but not the will to interfere\
      \ with you, even though your killing the same people they\u2019re supporting\
      \ and training \u2013 it\u2019s a strange world. The Turks on the other hand\
      \ have given us every reason to retaliate and it is only through good will and\
      \ restraint that we have not. The Russian people and the President have run\
      \ out of patience however. <br><br>Today you know that the Strategic Forces\
      \ out of Engels airbase will conduct another cruise missile mission and will\
      \ probably fly the missiles through Turkey. The Turks got quite upset the last\
      \ time we did this and our intelligence assessment links the reaction to that\
      \ event to them shooting down our Sukhois-24 last November. We will be ready\
      \ this time!<br><br>You had a long conversation with the Chief of the Air Force\
      \ last week, he gave you freedom to beat up the Turks \u2013 should they start\
      \ the fight \u2013 but to keep the Americans and NATO out of it! That could\
      \ be very tricky but you believe that if your actions are limited and not provocative\
      \ towards NATO, you just might do it. <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>Turkish\
