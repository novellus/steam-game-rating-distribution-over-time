The game fails to live up to them in every possible regard, right from the very moment the game is loaded in.\n\nThe very first thing you'll notice is that the interface lacks polish. While the ingame models certainly have PS1-era graphics, it becomes clear that little to no effort was put into polishing the interface. The title screen alone feels less like a videogame menu and more like a Powerpoint presentation screen. And this is before starting a New Game proper.\n\nUpon starting a New Game, you're treated to a simplistic opening animation where you're zooming across an undetailed landscape, and a quick rundown is given to you. A picture of one of the plot elements is introduced, once again, like a slide in a Powerpoint presentation. A tutorial screen is shown that infodumps aspects of the gameplay on you (My advice: Do not do this; rather than infodumping the game's mechanics, introduce the mechanics over time as the game progresses and give explanations of them one at a time.\n\nYou eventually get into a battle, and to start with you only have the Attack, Magic, and Defend commands. The interface is somehow even more simplistic than at the title screen, and has the feel of a cheap flash phone game. The framerate remains terrible, the attacks and spells lack impact, \n\nThe character designs look interesting, but overall this game is terribly lacking in polish and in substance even from the onset, and is riddled with bugs. I can't even begin to recommend it. I sincerely hope that the creator intends to improve and to make more attempts in the future; the premise is promising but a lot of work needs to be done for the presentation to be interesting and enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1577153949,"timestamp_updated":1577153949,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598777234554290771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41O3smu8CcZ7C5gE="}
