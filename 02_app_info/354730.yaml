    review: So the game engine and pixel art with skill tree seems fantastic but I
      can't forgive the usual crappy portraits, the text boxes as they are and how
      small view you get on the area from above. I'd also rather have monsters standing
      in one place waiting for you to attack them rather than encountering them at
      random. Also a non-mandatory full screen would be nice and go even further as
      making a settings bar in the menu instead of having you to click F1
