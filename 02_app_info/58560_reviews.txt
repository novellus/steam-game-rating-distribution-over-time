I played the first game years ago so I didn't remember everything about that one, but the game lets you recap the previous events. What I remember from the first game this one seemed more balanced, mature and chill on the humor. It's not necessarily a bad thing for a change, although I don't mind all the wacky over the top craziness either.\nI was a bit doubtful at first about the new art style since it's a complete shift towards 3-D, but I found out I liked it very much as the game progressed. It made the characters more lively and lifelike and let me fully immerse in the world.\nThe fact that you can play as both Gina and Brian was cool and you shortly can understand more about the characters, their preferences what they can and want to do. Like Brian has no problem about digging dumpsters as Gina wouldn't do that.\nThere were certain points in the game where I didn't fully understand the game logic or what I'm supposed to - Solutions to certain puzzles seemed strange when there could have been much more obvious ways to do it.\nLuckily there is an in-game hint system hotline included, if you'll get stuck and want to use that.\nIt could have benefited from more musical input in my opinion. The soundtrack is good, but there was a bit too much silent parts.\n--\nOverall I thought the game looked good and it was fun to play that. I sympathized and cared for the main protagonists.\nI'm about to play more Pendulo titles after this and I can only give my recommendations for this one.","timestamp_created":1608940406,"timestamp_updated":1608940406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz8iUzvYCdIObvQI="}
