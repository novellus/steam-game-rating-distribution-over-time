    review: 'I love Hacker Evolution. Just for you, I''ll copy/paste parts of my review
      for the gameplay.


      Hacker Evolution is perhaps a writing simulator, as you need to type the command
      but you need your brains to avoid to be traced and to have a game over. Sometimes,
      you''ll need to begin a new campaign because you can''t do anything but try
      a different manner to avoid spending too much money you''ve "stolen" or to add
      to your trace level. That''s perhaps the most frustrating thing in HE.


      You''re going to read files, find passwords, find exploit files that will make
      your life easier, crack, decrypt, use your brains to know how many hosts you
      need, upgrade your hardware (should I add a faster modem or a better firewall
      or more CPU Ram?).


      That''s the core of HE. However, if you''re here, it means that you already
      know about the graphics and the great soundtrack. So, is the Hardcore Package
      worthy?


      The weird thing is that the Hardcore Package 1 is... easy. Hack all the servers
      with money and you will have no problem to solve two levels.


      Yep, the package is having only two levels. For 2 euros, I would have expecting
      at least a little more than two easy levels for a package that should make you
      sweat and look tightly at your bounces, level traces, etc...


      I''m still recommending them anyway, because it''s always nice to have more
      levels. If you want a real challenge, try the second package!


      NB: if you have HE: Untold, the two Hardcore Packages are the same as those
      for HE.'
