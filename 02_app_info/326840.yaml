    about_the_game: Heart&amp;Slash is a 3D brawler that is set in a world where machines
      are all that remains from the Human civilization. <br><br>You play as Heart,
      an innocent robot fighting to escape the grip of the evil and all seeing machine
      QuAsSy (Quality Assurance Systems).<br><br>But make no mistake Heart&amp;Slash
      is a hard game. Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated
      level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can
      use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore.<br><br>Heart&amp;Slash is
      an indie game developed by a small but passionate team. We have a tiny budget
      but big hearts, and we are giving it all to make this game (our first) the best
      we can.<br><br><strong>Features (on final release):</strong><br>-3 worlds to
      explore and fight in. Each world includes its unique enemies an bosses.<br>-Dozens
      of different weapons and equipment pieces (more than 100 in total) to customize
      Heart and your play style.<br>-Perma-death, but a persistent progression system
      that gives you more options as you play the game.<br><br>We hope you enjoy Heart&amp;Slash
      as much as we enjoy making it!<br><br>Welcome!
