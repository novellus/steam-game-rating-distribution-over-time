    review: "Extremely buggy escape room game with above average graphics and some\
      \ nice jump scares.\n\nControls are the stupidest I have ever encountered in\
      \ VR. with the right hand controller continually turning off and on your left\
      \ hand torch whenever you move or interact with anything. Also, objects continually\
      \ disappearing through floor and ceiling. Buttons discussed in tutorial are\
      \ missing from the mapping. \n\nThis could have been good if the developer had\
      \ actually bothered to play it through before release."
