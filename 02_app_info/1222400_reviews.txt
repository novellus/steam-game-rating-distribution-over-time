It has some problems, but all together it was a good experience. I enjoyed the romance and I get the impression that it's probably the selling point for the game. I liked the companion characters, and I wish there was more meaningful interaction outside of their routes. I also liked that even in the individual routes there was a lot of ways to romance the characters.\n\nThis definitely felt like the first in a series and ill pick up the sequel when it comes out. I hope that whatever comes next irons out he issues. I wont go to much into the issues because theres already a bunch of reviews and I think this game deserves a little extra positivity.","timestamp_created":1605459853,"timestamp_updated":1605469976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Pbd5vUCcoHJrgI="}
