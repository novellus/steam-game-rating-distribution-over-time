In real life it's part steam heritage, part regional railway, and part mothballed, so you can convincingly run almost any non-electric German stock from the last sixty years.  The central section has some big loops, spiral tunnels and long viaducts, but the gradient isn't too extreme. It's nicely modelled and has quite a charming rural feel to it.\n\nThe stock and scenarios are bizarre. The BR 86 is valid, but having it pull modern wagons is not.  I don't know why DTG didn't throw in a regional diesel MU, that would have been good.\n\nIt's a nice place to run German stock in quick drive as AI is minimal in real life, so you won't miss it. I give it a qualified recommendation, which means buy it in a sale.","timestamp_created":1606598848,"timestamp_updated":1606598848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4J2wiPYCccbitAI="}
