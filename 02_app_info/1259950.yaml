      /><h2 class="bb_tag">EMBRACE THE CLASSIC</h2>Darkest Valley is an homage to
      the many great 2D action RPGs from the last twenty years. The original soundtrack,
      the visual style, and the story is a meld of our favorite elements from the
      classic and unforgettable titles in this genre. Relive those experiences in
      this modern indie creation.<h2 class="bb_tag">HIGHLY STRATEGIC, POWERFUL BUILDS</h2>Wield
      customizable weapons and armor with 8 item types and a wide variety of potions.
      Skills apply weapon hits to enemies with interesting effects, combining with
      crafted attributes to allow huge customization in the way you attack and defend.

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">THREE VERY DIFFERENT SKILL CLASSES</h2>Choose to be an
      agile melee fighter, a point and click ranged tank, or a strategic summoner.
      Each class has 3 tabs of skills, and many different ways to play each. Leverage
      your fast reflexes, careful positioning, or thoughtful planning to defeat the
      hordes you will encounter.<h2 class="bb_tag">GROW YOUR POWER WITH MAGICAL SHARDS</h2>There
      is no grind-based experience system in Darkest Valley. Increase your level and
      grow your strength by seeking out and finding otherworldly crystals shards that
      bestow great power upon those who wield them.<h2 class="bb_tag">FACE MONSTROUS
      CREATURES</h2>Throughout your journey you will fight against an array of creatures,
      from at first seemingly harmless slimes to monstrous trees that can walk, to
      horrors that come from the darkest depths. Dodge traps and find unexpected allies,
      where danger lurks around every corner.<h2 class="bb_tag">FAST TRAVEL THROUGH
      THE MUSHROOM TUNNELS</h2>In Darkest Valley there is little need to backtrack.
      Each area contains a mysterious enoki-like waypoint that acts as a portal and
      can be used to instantly teleport you from one area to another. If you die,
      you can simply teleport back to the latest waypoint and continue on your journey.
