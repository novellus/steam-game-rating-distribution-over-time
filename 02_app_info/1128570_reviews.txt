Beat it in a little under 2 hours using the spacebar and the mouse.  No difficulty, it's a game where you read.  There aren't any choices to be made outside of the main charrie's name.  It says it's mature, and for one scene I could maybe see that, but there's nothing showing and there's 0 hentai.  \n\nMost of the game is straight up average.   It broke me that Melanie's (The Nun's) character art had this far-gazing stare and faced away from the characters when they could've just flipped her around.  There were also typos throughout, some funnier than others but it didn't get in the way of reading too badly.  Music was alright and fit the mood. \n\nYou're ultimately in this for the story.   And yes, the story is worth it.  It's completely worth the 2 dollars.  It goes from interesting plot to \"WTF?!\" midway through. Like the story writers hit a 'Screw it' moment, got drunk, binge watched a few K-drama sitcoms, and let it fly.\n\n... It Was Popo All Along!  [i](J/king.  Not a spoiler.  Don't kill me.)[/i]  \n\nBut no, if you're looking to be entertained and want a short, harmless VN, Weeping Willow exists.  There's no wolfgirl-pronz, the translations could be better, but the ridiculous plot is different from the other VNs out there and will entertain you for a little while.","timestamp_created":1609552975,"timestamp_updated":1609553449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gpK34PYCdN3KvwI="}
