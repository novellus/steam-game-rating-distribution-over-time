    review: At first glance, Encased is a marvel in the making.  Then you start to
      move through the world, and discover that functionality and features have been
      prioritised to enhance the 'shop front' for an early access game.  The devs
      have stated that they are following their own take on an 'agile' delivery, with
      no coherent delivery map of features or functionality.  Indeed, at the moment,
      they are sprucing up the opening scenes to presumably cut back on requested
      refunds through steam.  So if you want early access with a MASSIVE emphasis
      on early, AND you enjoy long odds on investments paying dividends, then this
      is the game for you.
