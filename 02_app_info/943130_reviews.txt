I started over countless times trying to get it right but the actors are either too depressed or not confident and refuse to improve. I have to keep notes on actual note cards so that I can find them the best fitting role for them and most of the time they dont get it because of something that wasnt my fault (ie lack of confidence, not prepared, or depressed). I would have liked this game, had it been more fleshed out and less just thrown together.\n\nA filter in the available roles would have been nice. Easier to find the correct role for your people. Or adding the ability to audition for more than one role, like you can in real life.","timestamp_created":1606186997,"timestamp_updated":1606186997,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40JKN/PUCevOVsAI="}
