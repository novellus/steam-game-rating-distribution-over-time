    short_description: In a world where the more a knight achieves, the more wives
      he can obtain, a young man sets off on an adventure with lust in his heart.
      Walk the land, sail the seas, fly through the sky! It's a sex-seeking, world-traversing
      RPG!

    review: 'HEAR ME OUT! It''s not bad because it''s not bad, it''s just so far on
      the, "eh" side. I wish we had a sideways thumb choice.


      Pros

      Combat

      Badge system (I''m calling it that because it reminds me of that system from
      the Paper Mario Series)

      Sound

      Voice actors

      Music

      Stat system

      The cultures there actually make an unique concept


      Cons

      Exposition, stop it, get some help

      Story

      Hit and miss writing

      Main character (I get he''s suppose to be the way he is as more of a fill in
      character)

      Rewards from beating difficult and or powerful bosses


      If it just stopped with it''s exposition dumps and just let the audience put
      two and two together when it could let the audience aim at more information.


      SPOILERS!!!!

      The story outright telling you something that''s a, "NO DUH" the threat in the
      story HAS PEOPLE WHO CAN SUPPLY THEM! Oh you''re telling me the people who can''t
      grow anything themselves have someone funding their efforts? NO! You don''t
      say?


      SHE"S A PRINCESS! NO YOU DON"T SAY! I get the fact you make the main character
      a dumb ass so you can spoon feed the smooth brains this info.


      Look if you''re okay with being spoon fed information and conveying info as
      if you''re a baby sure it''s okay but this time wasting point less thing is
      not something I desire to experience. Bad writers have to spoon feed.'
