I'm sure this could be rectified by a low directional light from either the top or side which just catches the dart.\n\nApart from these two faults its very good - but unplayable in it's current form - for me anyway.  \n\nI'm refunding now but will keep an eye open and if these are rectified I'll re-purchase.","timestamp_created":1609693421,"timestamp_updated":1609694353,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609700134,"developer_response":"Hi lloyd709!\n\nThanks for the review! We agree with both points you've made and are implementing updates right now. We'll have a menu toggle to hide the cartoon particles as well as better lighting to illuminate darts on the board.\n\nWe've also got a large update coming with Cricket, a completely revamped UI, and general tweaks and bug fixes.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts after the update. :)\n\nCheers!"}],"cursor":"AoJ45tLQ5PYCf5yQwAI="}
