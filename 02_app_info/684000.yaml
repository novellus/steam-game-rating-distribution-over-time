    review: 'This is where Steam really needs a "mixed" option, because while overall
      I feel the game is marred consistently by awful crashes that happen out of nowhere,
      quite periodically might I add, a general lack of direction, and unfinished
      content, it is still quite an enjoyable game. But on the whole, just from where
      the product stands as of now, it''s not worth the time or the investment.


      I played almost 30 hours of this game, and it was well worth it. The game is
      rather difficult, but strategic, which I thoroughly enjoy. There are lots of
      interesting and different builds you can try with all of your characters, and
      different save slots allow you to play through different variants of your characters,
      giving you a plethora of options in regards to how you can play. That being
      said, one general frustration is you can ONLY save to that slot that you''re
      currently playing on, and can''t backtrack should there be a game breaking bug
      that you can''t get past, which I will be posting up later on today. The good
      things that this game does, it does well. Ghost Town, variety of different quests,
      amazing lore, all of that is great.


      Inversely though, the bad things this game does, it does....really really badly.
      And they really seem to overshadow the good. Overly excruciating maps with no
      variety in them. Just long drawn out hallways that span minutes upon minutes
      of just walking in a straight line. Granted, there are quite a few different
      areas I felt were really good and had lots of feeling (Lampless, Divine Tower/Forest,
      Katis, Undead Castle, which is probably my favorite area in the game), but there
      were others that are just awful. Wooden Road, Pseudo Hell, Underground Mines,
      and Frozen Cavern came to mind as my least favorite maps. Maps are very very
      dark, which is intentional and I get it. But there''s a thin line between being
      immersive and being a detriment to the player. Infinite Hotel is the worst offender
      of both the above. It''s literally a 500 x 500 map with nothing but rooms in
      long hallways.


      And lastly, the thing that aggravates me the most is the massive amount of times
      I saw "Future Content" in the game. This should have been shipped with the game
      the first time, and instead we are being dripfed new content like a bad live
      service game. This is the sort of tactic I would expect from a AAA developer
      to spoonfeed future content down the line, but indie RPG Maker developers should
      have everything they need right out of the gate. Patches for glitches and bug
      fixes obviously can come later on down the line.


      That being said, this really is a good game, but for the asking price and how
      little actual "content" there is right next to all the spots that say "Future
      Content" is really bewildering. Bugs and glitches are rampant in this game,
      some of them inconsistent. One of my friends who streamed the game was able
      to start a Quest just fine but I am not able to start it because my characters
      just keep walking in a straight line. Going outside of the Red Temple after
      meeting [spoiler]The Symphony of Carbon[/spoiler] forces you to rewatch the
      scene when you enter the Red Temple again, and then softlocks your game. And
      not to mention the crashes. THE CRASHES ARE THE WORST. There is no excuse to
      have your game randomly crash at all, even by just going into a menu and having
      it crash. Even by just going into a battle and having it crash. And with no
      prompt, no error message. Just boom, crash, done. It''s extremely aggravating.


      If these ever get patched or fixed, I would be willing to change my stance on
      the game, but again, this game is not worth the asking price right at this moment.'
