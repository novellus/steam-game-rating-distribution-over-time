We didn't do it as a one shot and I made the story about Rick kidnapping the players by his portal science and I allowed the special rules that are laid out in the guide so players could really let loose like they were watching the TV show. This was a great fun house style dungeon that really entertained my group of 7 players for 8 weeks.","timestamp_created":1590550575,"timestamp_updated":1590550575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+faMqvICfMbEigI="}
