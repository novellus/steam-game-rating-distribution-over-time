    review: "Two years ago \u2014 H-content will be there later.\n@\nOne year \u2014\
      \ Still thinking about new features.\n@\nSomewhere later \u2014 \"Jiggle animations;\
      \ Suggestive artwork\".\n\nNo this is not an excuse to act like content is here,\
      \ or it's coming soon.\nYeah, it's cheap af, but as the game itself it generally\
      \ not even close to be decent, whole sell-point was H-content promised to be\
      \ later, and two years after it's still not here, dev is probably dead when\
      \ it comes to any kind of communication.\n\nSo no, it's not coming, don't buy\
      \ this."
