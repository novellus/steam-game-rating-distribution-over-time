    about_the_game: <strong>Atlas Tile Editor</strong> (ATE)<br><br>2D TILE CREATOR!<br><br><strong><i>What's
      an Atlas Tile?</i></strong><br><br>In games of yore, atlases (also known as
      sprite sheets) combined to form the entire world of a game.  You could build
      the world by using a single texture, which helps decrease &quot;texture swaps&quot;
      in GPU hardware, and speeds up the game's rendering, while also helping the
      world get made by reusing art stored on these atlases. <br><br><strong><i>Yes,
      you can save to PNGs and use the output from this program in RPG Maker or GameMaker
      or Construct or AppGameKit or .. many more game engines!</i></strong><br><br><strong>Atlas
      Tile Editor (ATE) is an up-and-coming tile editor that will allow pixel artists:</strong><br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Create reusable sprite atlases similar to the functionality
      of GlueIT and TexturePacker.<br></li><li>Create advanced geometric tilesets
      for OpenGL (and DirectX) games in a way not currently available.<br></li><li>Pair
      customized tilesets with heightmap and normalmap data using a simple cyborg
      algorithmic and artistic way of building heightmaps as you customize tiles,
      using a provided height atlas.<br></li><li>Use the native ATE format, or a JSON
      exporter for tile overlay geometry features<br></li><li>Export &quot;baked&quot;
      tiles (available, but not recommended) as PNG, for legacy engines or engines
      that cannot use Atlas Tiles(tm).</li></ul><br><strong>Whoa whoa whoa, wait,
      you mean you can put actual geometry on these tiles?</strong><br><br>Yes, the
      entire premise of the Atlas Tile Editor is to provide a way to draw tiles on
      the fly from a single texture, but using 2D geometry to allow multiple samples
      from this texture to create essentially new artwork as a collage.  The 2D geometry
      is then assembled into a VBO and displayed in your favorite engine using a shader.<br><br>Just
      to recap, here's what you'll do in Atlas Tile Editor (ATE):<br><br>1) Create
      customized tiles from texture atlases.<br>2) Save &quot;baked&quot; tiles as
      PNGs<br>3) Save &quot;unbaked&quot; tiles as ATE packages.<br>4) Save &quot;unbaked&quot;
      tiles as CSS/JSON packages.<br>5) Save your workspace to recall your work whenever
      you'd like.<br>6) Create and associate customized height maps, which are converted
      automatically to normal maps.<br>7) Export tile packs with height maps, normal
      maps and color maps.<br>8) Import and pack tiles using BestRectPack algorithm.<br>9)
      Import and pack tiles using &quot;row and column&quot; packing (to create Sprite
      Sheets)<br>10) Add, rotate and stretch tile geometry with granular control.<br><br>Future

    review: i really love this program right price very usefull features and a lot
      room for improvement for and add more cool features but the user user interface
      is ugly as hell (really dev you should focus more on your GUI) you can't use
      this program immedietly or navigate with ease trought the program features but
      the program by itself is very cool and it easily fits  for any indie 2D game
      developer with low budget to spare
