(Total of 5 game modes)\n+ You can play this either as an Arcade Game (Not recommended) Or as a Sim Game (Recommended). Choice is up to you\n+ You can also change your Tuning for certain Freestyle Events and Racing to suit your gamestyle.\n+ Easy is a bit of a joke, but Hard Difficulty is challenging and will you keep on your toes!\n+ Graphics look stunning and very well done, even the detail when your Truck gets all muddy and and your \n+ Sounds are amazing, especially the Monster Truck Engine audio it's so F**** good! (Music however is poor)\n+ Has Wheel Support which you can also customize to your liking.\n+ Works fine with a keyboard and is not overly complicated. (How I played)\n+ It's well optimized and I had no bugs or crashes or any issues, I played on an Intel i7 6700, 16gb ram and GTX 1060 6gb and never noticed any killer frame drops.\n\nNow on to the Negatives:\n\n- Online is dead, literally dead. I tried playing some online on Day 2 and I could never find any matches. Trying to find an online race as we speak so I can rate the online but I'm unable to find any. Tried hosting but no one ever joined.\n---------.- You're also limited to the game modes you play on online, basically you can either play a race or a drag. You can have \ndifferent stages and set as many laps as you want but then again online is dead.\n- After you finish the career mode you literally have nothing to do.\n- For some reason Time Trail is not part of the events you do in the Career Gamemode which is a shame. \n- You can set up a team to help you give you boosts but they're just that. No real depth of managing wages or interaction, just a passive boost.\n----------.- Sponsors also have no visual effect except from giving you a bonus but it might just be me nit picking really.\n- Game time is a bit small as I finished it after 7-8 hours and I'm not really feeling like going back doing the career mode again.\n- Menu Music (In my opinion) is awful and I wished we got some Heavy Rock type music to up the Atmosphere. (Personally I just muted music)\n\nHonestly with all the stuff I mentioned it's still a decent game for Monster Trucks enthusiasts and it's worth a buy for €40. HOWEVER as a gamer who has no idea about Monster Trucks (Me being a bit of both) it's not really worth the €40 BUT! It's still worth it if you can get it on sale, maybe €20-30.\n\nReplay ability I'm also not really sure... I mean you can always jump back in do some Quick Races but I'm not sure about how many times I'd do that.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 7.8\n\nGraphics: 9/10,... Gameplay: 8/10,... Career Mode: 5/10,... Music: 2/10,... Sound: 9/10,...
