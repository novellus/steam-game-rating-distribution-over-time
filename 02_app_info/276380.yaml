    review: 'This is a mind-numbing game. Sometimes, I need something like this to
      help me relax and it can be effective as a means of slowing down my higher brain
      function. However, if you''re looking for a decent pet game or actual boarding
      simulator THIS IS NOT IT! This is not a simulator, it has more in common with
      a tap-based mobile game to be honest. If you''re going to get this game, and
      I don''t recommend that you do, then just buy it with the rest of the familyplay
      bundle during the summer or winter sale for $14. You can get eleven games, some
      of which are decent, for about $1.50 each when you break it down. That, in my
      opinion, is the most this game is worth.


      Pros:

      1. Animal Models - Some people might find some of the animals cute (I think
      the rabbits are okay)

      2. Cheap - As stated above, when purchased with the familyplay bundle, the price
      of this game was about $1.50 for me. The normal price of $15 is BEYOND absurd.


      Cons:

      1. Store page flat out LIES - There are no mini-games whatsoever. You do not
      mix feeds, lunge foals, give medicine, or teach tricks. Also, there are no side
      missions to speak of, and calling the gameplay a "main mission" is undue flattery
      of the actual product.

      2. NO WAY to speed up the gameplay - Gameplay drags, especially in the first
      3 scenarios or so. Once you have 3+ types of animals in residence it gets a
      little more involved, but there''s still a lot of dead space. You also cannot
      end the days early.

      3. No sandbox mode - You play only in 7 set scenarios, all but the last one
      would basically count as tutorials in any other game. The last scenario is the
      only one where you can have all six different types of animals, and you MUST
      play them through to completion in order to unlock them one by one. It''s not
      hard, it''s just tedious.

      4. Weird voice acting - Grandpa guest sounds like an animated Tim Curry villain
      wannabe (might be a pro?)

      5. Unclear instructions - There is NOTHING to indicate to you what the different
      care symbols for the animals mean. Some are obvious, like health, food, and
      cleanliness, but others, such as the diamond, the person and the tree, and the
      face with the plus symbol are very unclear on what they mean and how you fulfill
      them. Also, the values in this game are backwards. Usually, in this type of
      game, having hunger at 100 is a good thing, it means the animal is satisfied,
      but the values in this game are reversed (hunger = 100 is very bad).

      6. Difficulty settings are a joke - Goes along with unclear instructions, but
      the game is stupidly easy in any setting

      7. No customization of character - You are a blond, very pale, teen for the
      whole game whether you like it or not. I didn''t expect this to bother me as
      much as it did, but I''m a brunette and always make my character in sim games
      like this brunettes as well.

      8. You cannot run - Because doing so would just give you MORE dead time to fill.

      9. Some animal models come in only one color - Cats, to my knowledge, only come
      in orange, and most rabbits are pure white.

      10. Bad script - Guests will say the same lines to you whether you accept their
      pet or not, which can be kind of funny. Also, you say some awkward things to
      the animals you care for ("Good PET" is one of them, I mean was it really THAT
      hard to just assign a sex to the animals so you could say good boy/girl? Who
      says GOOD PET?!?!?!?!?!?!)

      11. No point to the separate days - You will start a new day (called "rounds"
      in the game for some godforsaken reason) in the exact same location you ended
      it in and the animals stats will not change at all.

      12. Out of place sound effects - I can hear random dogs barking in scenarios
      where dogs have NOT been unlocked yet.

      13. You can''t move the camera diagonally down right'
