    review: 'The game works fine on Windows 10, both PS and DOS versions. Nevermind
      these lamers in the other reviews. It''s a DOSBox game, which means it''s perfectly
      compatible with Windows 10, and even Linux if you want (you''ll need to use
      a native DOSBox app, not Wine).


      If you happen to have some issue, install a DOSBox separately, maybe try changing
      some of the few options in it. Or maybe check the forums. Get used to these
      things if you''re into old games.


      I''m very glad they''ve included the PS1 version too.'
