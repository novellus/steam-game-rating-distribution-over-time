    review: 'Amazing stealth based top-down shooter. You play as a convict who is
      offered a deal for a chance at freedom. Your mission is to save hostages in
      a hotel while fighting terrorists that you can either KO or kill. You ascend
      the hotel while having to deal with all sorts of bad guys, but things are not
      as simple as they seem.


      Also features mini games such as a giraffe platformer and a Galaga inspired
      shooter.'
