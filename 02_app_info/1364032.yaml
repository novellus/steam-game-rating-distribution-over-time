      \ Merchant Navy Class 35028 \u2018Clan Line\u2019, as preserved today in the\
      \ classic BR Green livery!<br><br>The Merchant Navy Class dates back to the\
      \ 1940s, it was designed by Oliver Bulleid to be a fleet of express passenger\
      \ locomotives for the Southern Railway. They featured a 4-6-2 wheel configuration,\
      \ giving them their nickname \u201CBulleid Pacifics\u201D, although not to be\
      \ confused with \u201CBulleid Light Pacific\u201D, as that was another design\
      \ built after it transpired that the Merchant Navy was too heavy for some lines.<br><br>The\
      \ other nickname attributed to the class is \u201CSpam Can\u201D, thanks to\
      \ the air-smoothing casing that adorned the sides of the locos. It was intended\
      \ that this smoothing would lift exhaust gases from the loco, and make cleaning\
      \ easier with the locos fitting in carriage washes better. Unfortunately, the\
      \ smoothing introduced other issues, maintenance was more challenging and smoke\
      \ would often cling to the loco body, severely reducing driver\u2019s visibility.<br><br>As\
      \ a result, in the 1950s the decision was taken to rebuild the fleet, during\
      \ which the smoothing would be removed and valve gear would be updated. This\
      \ brought an end to the fleet\u2019s unique design, but produced a set of much\
      \ improved locomotives that would excel on routes such as the South Western\
      \ Main Line until the end of the steam era.<br><br>The class was withdrawn between\
      \ 1964 and 1967, having been superseded by Warship diesel locomotives on the\
      \ line to Exeter via Salisbury. Miraculously though, just over 1/3 of the fleet\
      \ was saved from the scrapyard.<br><br>One of those locomotives is 35028 \u2018\
      Clan Line\u2019 which was saved and lovingly restored by the Merchant Navy Locomotive\
      \ Preservation Society. Under MNLPS ownership, Clan Line has been working on\
      \ the mainline on tours and excursions since 1974, and has since hauled the\
      \ British Pullman, visited rails far beyond its operational network, and even\
      \ hauled the Royal Train in 2018.  Based at Stewarts Lane TMD in Battersea,\
      \ Clan Line is regularly seen in London and the south of England, and can now\
      \ be experienced in full authenticity thanks to the hard-working efforts of\
      \ Bossman Games!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>A total\

    review: 'BMG always deliver amazing products and this is no exception.


      My favourite DLC at the moment and I don''t even own any of the routes for the
      scenarios! (I prefer to make my own).


      Yes you do need to learn to drive it properly (as you do all BMG locomotives)
      and it is an incredibly thirsty locomotive. I tend to drive with the HUD but
      have now taught myself not to drive with it so I could use this locomotive properly
      and it is definitely worth it! Anybody wishing to buy it, or any BMG locomotive,
      should not be put off by any negative comments saying it is too hard. If I can
      do it then anybody can. The first time I drove it without the HUD or automatic
      fireman and I got such a buzz when I did it. Personally I prefer that sort of
      experience then the simple accelerate and brake action that many locomotives/multiple
      units (diesel and electric) are.


      Only negative is that, apart from the support coach ''Mercator'', it doesn''t
      come with any carriages itself. Only an issue if you do Quick Drive. If you
      are a player who likes to watch the world go by, this might not be the best
      for you as I find myself constantly playing with the controls in the cab (very
      realistic). However this might be because I''m not an expert and I''m sure there
      are plenty of players who can handle all the controls and still enjoy the view
      out of the cab!


      If you are into steam locomotives and don''t mind learning to do somethings
      properly, then go for it.'
