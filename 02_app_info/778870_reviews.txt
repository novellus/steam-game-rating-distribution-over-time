Don't accidentally leave it in your library until your refund window expires like I did.\n---\n\nAll of the positive reviews for this game are a lie from paid shill reviewers. You want an example? Look at the review from Ego Tempest: https://steamcommunity.com/id/EgoTempest/recommended/778870/\n\nThat account has posted 640 positive reviews, all of them with only 5 to 10 minutes of play time on each game. That's 640 positive reviews that amount to nothing more than launching the game, letting it idle just long enough for steam to allow a review (5 minutes) and then turning the game off.\n\nThe other positive reviews are no better, paid reviewers who upvote everything. Even the forums for this game have no activity, there's one post from 2019 stating how bad the game is and not a single post since then.\n---\n\nSince I now own this game ($1.24 with coupon) I'll be forcing myself to finish it, but not without complaining about it every second until it's done, here's just a few off the top of my head:\n\n1. The story is the kind of nonsense written by a drunken idiot throwing darts at a dictionary to pick random words and string them together. You're in your office suit parachuting into a garbage dump to attract talking dogs with a bone so they can show you where to dig up a stolen microchip then get attacked by cops for being in the slums... it goes downhill from there...\n\n2. The combat mechanics make about as much sense as using a cat for milk, you can dive through people while holding a shovel.\n\n3. You can fly by wearing a vacuum. Do I even need to explain that vacuums work the opposite of anything that could even attempt to push you into the air? And no, it's not modified, you just randomly pick up a vacuum and use it like a jet pack.\n\nI suppose you would need to be on as much drugs and alcohol as the developer for any of this to make sense, but at that point you could just play in your own puke with a Popsicle stick and make up a story with just as much meaning.\n\nExcuse me, I'm going to go roll my face on the keyboard until the game is over.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1592982740,"timestamp_updated":1608949340,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560569643974304199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9tK2zvYCfJjrjwI="}
