    about_the_game: "Your Mother, who many consider to be the most dangerous and &quot;blackest\
      \ of witches&quot; to ever exist, has been trapped in a spell since you were\
      \ a baby. Recently, the bonds that hold her have been weakening. You hear her\
      \ voice. You feel her power! She wants to be free! You know in your heart she\
      \ isn't the monster everyone thinks she is. You decide to free her, but nobody\
      \ wants her back... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures of the game: <br />\r\n* Gather\
      \ your armies! Deploy different combinations of units to tank, heal or kite\
      \ your way to victory! Only the greatest of witches can beat the game without\
      \ a single casualty. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Do fun things like casting a wall\
      \ in front of you to stop a projectile heading your way! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      * Use your men as meat shields to keep yourself alive. If for some reason you\
      \ value their existence, use your armies spells and abilities to heal, shield,\
      \ manoeuvre and kite them to safety. Jump on the heads of ogres. Ride manticores,\
      \ dragons and many other powerful beasts. You can let your dragon do the fighting\
      \ while you heal her, or you can fight together for maximum damage. Keep yourself\
      \ alive at any cost, because if you fall, it all over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*\
      \ Dominate 100's of creatures. Find troop combinations and strategies that smash\
      \ and melt your enemies into the ground! Either they join you or die."
