    review: 'So far this is after one game - I''ll update if anything is different
      after further games.  This is to the ancient game HnefTafl what Battle Chess
      is to Chess.  It gives a game played like HnefTafl with some variations on what
      you choose for special pieces, table, etc, but gives you little animated battles
      between the pieces.  However it is from the same time period as the original
      Battle Chess so very pixelated and at times difficult to see clearly on a modern
      screen.  But I enjoyed the game and appreciate having a Battle Chess version
      of this ancient game as well.  I look forward to trying it more.


      I would recommend this for those interested in games like Battle Chess that
      don''t mind the aged graphics and it running in Dosbox.'
