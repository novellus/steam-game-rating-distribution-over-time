So the next best option is the mouse, which you can use to click and drag the character across the levels.\n\nHowever, due to the extremely poor level design, your character's head disappears through walls or dies when touching them. Since everything is seen from a bird's eye view on an angle it doesn't make it any easier to navigate the level without hitting something. Even if you are not close to a spiked object, the fact that your characters body hovered over the object because the levels were poorly layered, you die. The portals look like tears in the space time continuum, white ovals with black void in the middle.\n\nSpeaking of levels, when Level 1 is complete you instantly jump to Level 11?! What?\nWhen I completed Level 12 and began Level 13 I exited the game and then restarted it again.\nI had to redo Level 12 to get Level 13 to unlock again.\n\nWhen I unlocked the second section of the game (because I somehow collected all 50 gems from the locked levels?!) the first level was easy enough to complete, once I managed to figure out that to continue to the next level I had to slide towards the bottom corner of the portal to leave. The games poor design is consistent with the second half, just now with new invisible walls that get you stuck and killed. WHAT FUN!\n\nWouldn't even call it a game, just a huge mistake.","timestamp_created":1609065501,"timestamp_updated":1609065501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lOLx0fYCe57avQI="}
