If you don't know what it is, there is a tutorial that shows you how to play and even gives you useful tipps on how to best solve them. The first nonograms are easy but they get more challenging the more you progress. There are many puzzles, so it will take some playing hours to finish all of them. What I like most is the smoothing music, it's super relaxing and helps you to retrieve from stress after an exhausting day. Unfortunately there are no steam achievments, I would love to have them but whatever, it's still a great game.","timestamp_created":1606584954,"timestamp_updated":1606584954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZ37h/YCfZjQtAI="}
