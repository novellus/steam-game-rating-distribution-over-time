Can't go wrong for the price.  BUT!  The game will frequently crash for no apparent reason, usually when you change screens, sometimes even requiring a force close from Task Manager.  It's doesn't affect the game to much, as it autosaves often.  However, I've had it happen frequently, sometimes three times in less than 10 minutes, which is very frustrating.  Just some backend tweaking and this game would be a 100% recommend from me.","timestamp_created":1609123609,"timestamp_updated":1609123609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609282687,"developer_response":"Sorry for the crash.
