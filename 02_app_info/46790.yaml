    review: 'This isn''t Master of Orion.


      This game has less micro management, and thus is faster paced. Combat is closer
      to MOO 3 without the broken AI. Graphics is closer to MOO 1 but without the
      charming pixels.


      The game is Master of Orion watered down and that''s all the positive things
      I can say about it.


      If you have played any Master of Orion, you can continue playing them.

      If you haven''t played any Master of Orion. I don''t know your frame of reference
      but it''s safer to get a Master of Orion game than this watered down version.


      If you can''t get Master of Orion and crave Master of Orion, this game may still
      your hunger if you close your eyes really hard and let the Master of Orion soundtrack
      play through your head.'
