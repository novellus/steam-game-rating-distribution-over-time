    about_the_game: "The BR Class 89 was a prototype electric locomotive that was\
      \ set to transform the East Coast Main Line, and while reality went in a different\
      \ direction, one cannot deny the unique and powerful design that was the \u201C\
      Badger\u201D, and this one-of-a-kind loco is available to drive in Train Simulator!<br><br>With\
      \ the ECML amidst major transformation in the form of electrification, British\
      \ Rail were keen to source a brand new fleet of electric locomotives that would\
      \ haul services under the new wires. The initial specification was drawn up\
      \ by Brush at Loughborough and built at Crewe Works in 1986. Unfortunately,\
      \ the fate of the type was essentially sealed in the same year, when BR changed\
      \ their specification requirements after Brush had committed to building the\
      \ locomotive.<br><br>The new loco rolled off the production line and was dubbed\
      \ the BR Class 89, boasting 6 traction motors which would power it up to 125mph\
      \ in service.<br><br>Passenger service on the ECML was rather brief, it was\
      \ used on London \u2013 Leeds services for only about 3 years before a serious\
      \ failure occurred, and the locomotive fell by the wayside. It was rescued by\
      \ some Brush employees, and appeared at some events across the country, but\
      \ the future looked bleak.<br><br>But then came privatisation, BR and its sectors\
      \ had been replaced by rail franchises, and the newly formed GNER franchise\
      \ purchased the sole Class 89 for its own use following a motive power shortage.\
      \ It entered service once again in 1997, but history rhymed, and in 2001 a major\
      \ failure put the loco out of use and this time it was for good. The 89 was\
      \ once sold into preservation once again, where it remains to this day with\
      \ the long-term goal of making it operational for railtour use.<br><br>While\
      \ its service life was brief, and it never got the chance to become the mainline\
      \ workhorse it was meant to be, the BR Class 89 found a place in many enthusiasts\
      \ hearts, its unique design earned itself the nickname of \u201CBadger\u201D\
      , and it offered the occasional break from the norm for spotters.<br><br>Fans\
