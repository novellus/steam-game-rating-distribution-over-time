There are a lot of them.\n\nYou earn money for power ups and scarabs to build your city (which is pretty basic) by going through the cards in each set.\nYou can set a 10 sec timer on a card to add challenge.\n\nSimple, but enjoyable.\n\n7.5/10","timestamp_created":1593289682,"timestamp_updated":1593289682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550898194313049316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxeXd+/ICfMrokAI="}
