    developer_response: Sorry to hear about that error. Did you try it with mouse
      clicks (as an alternative to bypass the error point)? I will pass this info
      on to the developer and see if we can find a solution or workaround at the least,
      for you.

    review: 'The Game didn''t work from the third scene. Tapping space crashed the
      game, or jumped to the end scene. The following Error shows up [Error Scene

      Hopefully the bug can be fixed. The first minutes are quite funny and I laughted
