This game Haeven is a short little RPGmaker game, one with a lot of custom assets built into it.  Custom assets that are all quite pretty.  It must have taken quite a bit of work to make.  \n\nThis game has a really interesting concept, you are Cleril, a poet on a journey to reclaim your mind from your subconscious.  The problem is the second mission of the game has you heading to a neural center point, to put yourself into a coma.  My problem with this is that soon after the coma begins there is a boss fight called The Monster.  This fight I do not understand its purpose.  It is quite easy to beat all the other parts of it, then the head just heals constantly.  The head heals for around 8-10k damage a round while you can only do around 100.  I stopped caring at this point.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be coming back to this, despite the spooky atmosphere that chilled me to the bone.  I'd write more but I don't know how to elaborate here.","timestamp_created":1560536400,"timestamp_updated":1560536400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523684918880462646","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1561592955,"developer_response":"I'd be more than happy to create a custom save for you to use to get you past whatever possible bug occurred.  I did test the boss and had no issue.  Other players have finished the game in its entirety so I really have no clue what could cause such a bug."}],"cursor":"AoJwiPjNq+sCcJq0wwE="}
