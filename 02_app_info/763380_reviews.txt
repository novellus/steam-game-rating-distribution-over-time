Definitly not your generic RPG Maker game.\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Original combat system based on item management\n[*]Visuals which aren't the generic pixel sprites. I think they resemble OFF.\n[*]Delivers a not completely new, but nevertheless unconventional story.\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]The background music is incredible repetitive and becomes tedious quite soon.\n[*]In the later game you want have to travel between multiple locations to restock etc. all the time. But traveling is really annoying, forcing you to go through lots of dialogues and pauses over and over again.\n[*]I'm not a native speaker, but orthography and grammar felt subpar. In fact, I had problems with following the story at the end. Maybe that's why it also felt a bit forced and random there - it's possible I just did not get it completly due to the grammar issues.\n[*]While the levels are short, you've got to grind a lot in a arena (again with lots of dialogs), I wish the oversized arena (which impossible to finish if you don't want to spent another 10 hours into tedious grinding) would have been smaller, but there would have been some more areas to explore instead.\n[/list]\n\nTips and hints:\n[*]In the beginning you're asked to enter your name. Do that. I skipped that part because I was expecting some generic \"Hey [playername], here, take some [favorite food] and then you can meet [bestfriend]!\" stuff to force immersion. It's not like that, and throughout the game I regretted that I had just kept the default name \"PLAYER\".\n[*]Don't bother with the arena any more than necessary. I've just finished the normal leagues (expecting it would be done by then, but no, that's merely the half of it) and could roll over the bosses till the end (except for a secret boss).\n[*]In the beginning it's bit hard to understand what which item actually does: There are items which just cause an element's debuff (most of the time it says something about \"status ailments\" in the description) rendering the enemy vulnerable to that element, items which cause damage in an element and have just a chance to cause a debuff, and there are items which attack all enemies (they have a \"+\" sign in the icon). Other, special items explain themselves well enough (\"raises attack by two levels\" etc.)\n[*]When you're starting in a new area, the first thing you want to check out: where aer the items on the floor that you can pick up? Ideally these items lie close to an exit of the area (so you can re-enter the area easily to pick up the item again). When you've found that setup, grind your level until you can one-hit or almost one-hit the enemies and they can't deal much damage to you anymore. Then, proceed to the boss.\n[*]Most of the time you can flee from battles. Use that if you're out of items, or to reach a boss with a full inventory. This also holds true in the arena. Find out which enemies drop nice stuff (AoE items mostly) or give nice xp, kill them, and escape from the battle after that wave. Many times there's no reason to finish all waves of an arena fight just for some money.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1600035383,"timestamp_updated":1601368620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvr/A7PQCe+LToQI="}
