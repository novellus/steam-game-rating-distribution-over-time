    review: "I bought this game because graphicaly somewhat reminded me of The Swapper\
      \ - which is a great platformer where you use 'clones' of yourself to get things\
      \ done. But it did not engage me at all.\n The premises of the game are good\
      \ - you can use gravity, and control time, and it does look pretty cool. 20\
      \ minutes into the game and I regret buying it - and double regret buying it\
      \ 6 months ago and not being able to return it.\n The controls feel extremely\
      \ clunky. Trying to run and suddenly roll is not really confortable in the hand.\
      \ Having to examine the crates where the items are to just look at them and\
      \ click them seems a waste of time, just grabbing them would be easier. Deaths\
      \ don't have great animations, when I fell through a set of lasers no change\
      \ was seen in the character. The rope mechanics are OK but add to that sense\
      \ of clunkiness the game gives in overal.\n There is no control support (I tried\
      \ with both a PS4 and an 360 control) which would be good but not perfect -\
      \ as there is the option to shoot down enemy bullets with your own bullets while\
      \ you are on bullet time, and an analog stick might not be the best to do this.\n\
      \ Maybe in some time I would give this another try and change my mind, but I\
      \ encourage people to try it for themselves first."
