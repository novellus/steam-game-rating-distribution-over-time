Up to a point it was progressing nicely.  I did get stuck at one point and was unable to progress.   I think it may have been the final boss, perhaps but I am not sure.  Basically, at a certain level, there were just too many enemies to fight, and I ran out of ammunition.  So, not a great ending, but fun while it lasted...\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nFor the price this is a fun little game!  If you enjoy corridor type shooter games, then this one will suit you.  There is even a little story about resistance to some kind of cyber A.I. mastermind.  I'm enjoying this thoroughly.","timestamp_created":1591914671,"timestamp_updated":1593478517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kJKugfMCde3AjQI="}
