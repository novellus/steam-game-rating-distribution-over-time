However the environments, the music, is great and relaxing.\nIt is not such a game in usual sense. However it is more like some kind of VR travel experience.\nIt offers the ability to take a virtual tour of ancient scences.\n\nMove freely, looking around. Breaking the boundaries of time and space. \n\nIf you want to experience the scenery of ancient Egypt, this game is the one for you. its immersive feeling can make you feel like wandering around in ancient Egypt. With comfortable music. Many scenes are very real and detailed, and the structures are very delicate. Inside, I can freely explore the Egyptian pyramids and their internal structure.I have been to the Egyptian exhibition area in the British Museum. Totally different experiences. \n\nUnlike ordinary VR games, there is no such thing as going through barriers, just like traveling, you can wondar around whereever you like.\n\nFor a bundle with sixteen VR games inside, at only twenty five dollars in total discounted price, I think that's the value.\n\n","timestamp_created":1605521508,"timestamp_updated":1605521508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465116292238235474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6sCi6PUCc6DZrgI="}
