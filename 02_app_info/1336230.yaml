    review: This game is an interesting surprise to me. It has a very good combination
      of music, sounds, scenery, cartoonish feel, right 3d models, that gives a really
      nice atmosphere/feeling to the game. It also has a nice cartoonish feel about
      it. It can also be a little frustrating when it comes to advancing in the game,
      as it does challenge you. It also has small puzzles from time to time, patterns
      that you need to recognize in order to be able to advance in the game. It is
      challenging, fun and it teaches you patience and the sense of observation.
