    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Is It?</h2><br>Dragon Drop is a multi-use\
      \ application for tabletop gaming. This tool is designed to enhance the story-telling\
      \ experience, rather than replace it, by allowing a visual representation of\
      \ players within the story world, and allowing game masters to quickly react\
      \ to player choices and actions.<br><br>To put it simply: We put the tools in\
      \ your hand, so you can create the world you want to build. You\u2019ll be able\
      \ to speedily build world maps and dungeons in 3D, design your adventures with\
      \ encounter and player tokens, and best of all, your players will see the world\
      \ you\u2019ve built right on their phone screens, in real time. The story is\
      \ yours to tell, and the world is yours to create!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How Does\
      \ It Work?</h2><br>As the Game Master, you can set tile biomes, drag and drop\
      \ buildings, environment pieces, props, design dungeons, place encounter tokens,\
      \ loot tokens, and player pawns. Hide anything you don\u2019t want your players\
      \ to see with fog of war. Save your map, and create a room. Invite your players,\
      \ load up your map and start your adventure!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom World\
      \ Building</h2><br>No more waiting for a map release that fits your adventure.\
      \ With multiple biomes, buildings, and prop sets there are vast options for\
      \ adventure design. Build and save multiple maps to create an unparalleled homebrew\
      \ campaign. Set your adventure anywhere you want, with the world you want your\
      \ players to experience. All in gorgeous 3D!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Enhanced</h2><br>With\
      \ unobtrusive, fast controls and a simple drag and drop system, building a world\
      \ is fast and easy. Your players will be able to see themselves represented\
      \ in the world you\u2019ve built, and move within it. You can control the way\
      \ players experience your map with fog of war, hiding those all-important secret\
      \ areas and encounters. But the story is still yours to tell. We\u2019re just\
      \ here to give you +1 to visual representation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community\
      \ Minded</h2><br>We love community, so we wanted to make sure Dragon Drop kept\
      \ communities together. With a generated room/lobby system, you can adventure\
      \ at a distance with friends from around the world. You can also save and share\
      \ your map builds to fellow Dragon Droppers, giving untold potential for brand\
      \ new homebrew games and collaborative adventures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTI-PLATFORM</h2><br>We\
      \ want you to be able to use Dragon Drop on the platform you feel most comfortable\
      \ with. Dragon Drop works on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >No Login Required to Play</h2><br>Players will not be required to login to\
      \ play in a session. The Game Master simply needs to setup a unique room code\
      \ and share it with the party.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always Free</h2><br>Dragon\
      \ Drop will always be free. Forever! Functionality and updates will continue\
      \ to roll in as long as we have support by the community. We also do have some\
      \ pretty cool perks for our Patreon supporters, with many more on the way! All\
      \ the perks will be aesthetic to ensure that app functionality always remains\
      \ free."
