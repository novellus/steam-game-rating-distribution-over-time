      \ And how would you cope if every second counted? Award-winning graphic adventure\
      \ STAY asks those very questions: When Quinn wakes up alone in a locked room\
      \ with nothing of note save for a computer hooked up to a chat room, you become\
      \ his single ray of hope. Your choices \u2013 and your timeliness \u2013 will\

    review: 'The writing is bad. Imagine going to bed, being assaulted by a stranger,
      dragged to a dark room in the night by an assailant, then you wake up, then
      immediately get on a computer to talk to strangers online.

      Would you bother taking the time and having the presence of mind to use verbose
      language? Spellchecking your words? Describing your abysmal setting with more
      flowery imagery than the peeling wallpaper of your shabby surroundings?


      I rate this as a don''t buy.'
