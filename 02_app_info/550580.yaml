    about_the_game: Sticker Craft - game about combining stickers and collecting them.
      <br><br>For example, combine stickers &quot;Water&quot; and &quot;Lake&quot;
      and get &quot;Sea&quot; sticker. Combine &quot;Sea&quot; to get &quot;Ocean&quot;.
      Continue those logical sequences to discover all 210+ stickers. <br><br>Most
      of them can be crafted using combinations with other stickers, but some of them
      - only by Stickerizing [Wild] Stickers. That's unique feature of the game. <br><br>[Wild]
      Stickers appear only when some requirements are met. For example - play at night(real
      night) and wait for [Wild] Moon sticker to appear. Or place few Grass sticker
      to [Wild] Sheep sticker to appear. After that you need to tame them by combining
      them with special sticker called Stickerizer. This will create normal sticker
      and of course increase you discovered sticker number. But not all [Wild] elements
      are so easy to find.

    review: "And here I thought Doodle God had some weird combinations\nto work with.\
      \ By the logic from the author for example:\nRaft + Wood = Boat\nbut to make\
      \ a Ship it needs Boat + Boat and not Wood...\n\nThere're some some things I\
      \ adore, like the references to\nother games like \"I Am Bread\" and \"Goat\
      \ Simulator\" I also like\nthese \"Wild\" stickers that keeps on appearing by\
      \ performing some\nkind of combination within the workspace.\n\nVery pleasing\
      \ and all but that doesn't change my perspective\nthat the menu screen is awful,\
      \ the music which gets annoying after\nawhile and these (almost) ridiculous\
      \ and head-scratching\ncombinations which leaves my sanity flowing with the\
      \ workspace.\n\nI was going for a refund but then I realized it was\n0,99\u20AC\
      \ problems and I don't want it back...\n\n[b] 4/10 - Knife + Fishbone + Hay\
      \ + Women =\nNeedle in the Haystack by The Velvelettes [/b]"
