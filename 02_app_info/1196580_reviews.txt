Story-driven dark fantasy that is mechanically challenging as well. There is a particular way you have to defeat certain enemies. And there are no \"random encounters\" which I always found very annoying, every fight was part of the plot, to say the least. No grinding or anything. \n\nDo not let the graphics fool you. Although I think that they actually enhance the mood of the game, some may skip this title simply because of the graphics. Do not do that. If you are interested in narrative-driven RPGs, you must get this game. It has the same amount of story and value one would receive from a well written book, making it well worth the price. I paid $3.99, since it was on sale, but I may purchase a second copy to send to a friend because I feel that this game deserves it. \n\nMy favorite part is how well developed the characters seem to be. They are used to weave a fascinating world and a unique story. I feel like this game is great example of how video games can be used as a narrative art form.\n\nI visited the developer's website, and it says he is a writer. That is certainly true. Kyle Muntz is going places with this project. It also says he spent seven years to make this game. The effort shows. I hope this game wins a much wider audience so the developer can continue to make content.\n\nEdit: I did discover a few grammatical errors, though it by no means affects the story or playability of the game and I am sure that they will be fixed.","timestamp_created":1594369784,"timestamp_updated":1594369942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn9T2m/MCeMGhlAI="}
