Spiders are particularly creepy, graphics good. Would like more levels. The Good:\n\n1. Graphics are well done although the start room had some major shimmie issues for me\n2. Easy to get into (Swing shovel, reload grip buttons, and throw brains with MCs)\n\nThe not so good for me:\n\n1. Wave Shooter type game...blah (I did like the brain level though)\n2. Once Mummies get across chaperone you really have missing issues like all the other wave shooters and you immediately start losing life but can't see them hitting you\n3. Spider level has the spiders just appearing so if you just looked in one direction and it is clear there might be a spider appearing as soon as you turn away. This leaves no room for anticipation and you will find your self constantly turning your head (more so than you should) because of this. I prefer to have them just walking from some place far so you can time things more accurately instead of just, \"Surprise I'm here now but just wasn't !!! \". \n4. It is a stationary wave game. I just wanted to travel around in the nice environments. Wave shooters are not very immersive or exciting for me. They may be 3D but I want to free-roam.\n\nConclusion: If you like anything wave then this is for you. If you are like me and am tired of wave shooters then this probably won't hold your interest long but the brain level has promise and could use some more thought and last longer. That was a fun level even though it was a simple concept.  Interesting and different. Not a bad game at all. Easy controls and a different concept make all the difference here. Would give it an 8/10. \n\nFree so try it.\n\nHere is a first play video I did below. It will be viewable soon.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OIKuy-idpic","timestamp_created":1486409111,"timestamp_updated":1486409111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43eK4itoCfpa9cQ=="}
