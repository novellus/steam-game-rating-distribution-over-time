      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Tournament of the Tidewoken</h2>The Tournament of the Tidewoken
      was born as a way to find the strongest contesters to repel the increasingly
      stronger evil creatures, drawn to the core of the planet Nalraaf. <br><br>Many
      poweful beings, called the Tides, ruled over the lands of Nalraaf, a once empty
      planet with an unique biome and vast amounts of different landscapes. Three
      of those Tides, Kuundra, Aphase and Venphyra soon populated those worlds with
      gateways to different worlds, bringing in adventurous travelers, who built cities
      and began scavenging this planet for artifacts.<br><br>Soon after the creation
      of those portal gateways, the gods witnessed evil creatures of many kinds entering
      the gateways and invading Nalraaf. It was discovered that the magical core of
      the planet would not only benefit the Tides, but also lure energy hungry creatures
      through the gateways.<br><br>As the Tides have no physical form, there was nothing
      they could do to stop this invasion, but each to choose on a physical contender
      and lend him their power. Together they formed the Tournament of the Tidewoken.
      The winners earn the title of Tidewoken and become a vessel for the gods.<br><br><img
