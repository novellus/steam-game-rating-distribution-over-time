I can use my keyboard to drive other cabs that came with TS2021 for example Amtrack\n\nbut not with these new DLC :( \nI am again using the M4 and M2 cabs for the Metro-North (North America) but there is no tutorials so I have no idea how to start and drive these and I am using a keyboard and not some \"controller\".  Can anyone offer some advice here?  Thank you\n","timestamp_created":1609267958,"timestamp_updated":1609267958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj4r21/YCeu3DvgI="}
