Still, well worth the price.\n\nFirst of all, I have to unplug my secondary monitor when I start the game. Otherwise the screen size and placement will not work. It's okay to plug in again, though. I can even move the game window to the external screen without any problems. Adjusting monitor settings back and forth might solve the problem if you have only one screen. If I understood the reviews correctly, somebody actually got a refund because of this! Some customer support might have been a better solution...\n\nYou NEED TO watch the tutorial videos first. And watch them carefully. There is no narration, only example play. And it's not comprehensive. (I'm not sure if I should tell you to use Research Notes to increase the likelihood of finds at a dig site, because figuring this out by yourself might improve your experience...) But the videos are not linked properly on YouTube. You may not recognize them from the search result list, and autoplay does not queue them correctly. Click the in-game tutorials link, and surf from the publishers channel to get all the content.\n\nIn-game Help icons should be on as a default. They're not at the moment. Click them on when you start, and you will have a slightly easier time getting accustomed to things.\n\nDevelopers: The audio slider is way too difficult to work! Do something about this, please?\n\nAllowing duplicate samples will help your museum gain prestige sooner. It's really no big thing. There's limited space in exhibition categories, but you can take samples off the collection when you find something better. It would be nice to have an in-game record of all the finds through all the game time, whether exhibited or not. As there isn't, I wrote mine on Notepad.\n\nMuch of the game consists of hitting the space bar for Next Turn, while you wait for your geologists to get to sites, or for more pickaxes to accumulate. This is likely to annoy you in the beginning, but it will be less of a bother as the game progresses and you get more to think about.\n\nThere's lots and lots of tools needed to get to and access sites, but the only ones I've had shortages of have been maps, visas and pickaxes. It might be more interesting if some of the other tools they were more scarce, and if it were possible to trade them with the computer opponents. Or sell and buy at some free market... I would've been willing to pay a bit more for some extra functionalities like that.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, the learning experience is probably better if you haven't got a lot of prior knowledge about geology. Still, I consider The Geology Game a good investment.","timestamp_created":1606768670,"timestamp_updated":1606768670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw04a4jfYCc6SGtgI="}
