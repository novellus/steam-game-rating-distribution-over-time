    review: 'I only played the game for 5 minutes, but I left the game running for
      3 hours as I was doing christmassy stuff with my cats. So in short, I know very
      little of this game so far. The UI and map are excellent, I''m excited to go
      back and look at it more. I only took over one single city and explored over
      half of the map thus far, but it feels good to play.


      If you consider yourself a fan of something, you deserve to something something
      good review.'
