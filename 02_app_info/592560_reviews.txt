One needs the willingness to try a level over and over and over and over again. I never finished the second level; it was so frustrating.\n\nIdeas for improvement:\n-easier earlier levels (could easily just double/triple the number of save points; I think that's something simple to implement that would make a huge difference)\n-allow for more tolerance before starting over (half the time it didn't even look like I touched the edges; it's too finicky)\n-add in a menu option somewhere (either in game, or for the whole safe file) for an easier mode (e.g. reduce thickness of the ring)\n-background music\n\nI love a good challenging game, but I think this is a little too much (especially for the beginner levels). If the first couple levels are too frustrating for people to finish, and you cannot unlock later levels without doing earlier ones... people will miss out on most of your game. I want to see all the hard work put into this game and to explore the other levels!\n\nSummary: I'm just not a patient person. If you have no other games to play, then feel free to try this out and play the same level a million times..\n","timestamp_created":1535762662,"timestamp_updated":1535762662,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp9ClyeUCdNrfqQE="}
