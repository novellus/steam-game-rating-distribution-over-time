      /><br><br>   One More Night is a 4 player action packed top down shooter that
      will keep you on the edge of your seat struggling to survive just one more night!
      Get your team together, build towers, and prepare your defenses in an attempt
      to fortify your position as much as possible to protect yourself against the
      relentless horde of enemies!<br><br>   Game play is split up between two phases;
      day and night. During the day, players will have a few moments to access the
      shop to buy weapons, ammo, and buildings to help them to survive the coming
      night. Once the night phase begins enemies will start to spawn and target the
      players and their buildings. Each additional player to the team causes more
      enemies to spawn each round. Additionally, each night will spawn more enemies
      and they will get progressively tougher every night. As the team survives more
      nights new, harder, types of enemies will start to spawn.<br><br> You will need
      to find out which strategies work best to survive as long as you can. Will you
      build a base and bunker down or will you try and out run the enemies until you
      die of exhaustion? The choices you make will dictate how long you and your friends
      survive.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/535630/extras/fire_banner.png?t=1584831320"
