As far as the art style goes I find it very appealing and if you are a fan of the Witcher series the main character might be a throwback. The opening cinematic is voiced well and has an interesting story to tell.\nHowever the game is very difficult, and unfairly so, I would recommend playing it just for the sake of seeing how far you can get; I'd really like to see someone get to the end. The random spawns of enemies more often than not put you into a situation where you just die, topped with the characters sporadic jumping getting to 50 meters in this game is an achievement. Pray to RNGesus and see where you end up.","timestamp_created":1543971412,"timestamp_updated":1543971412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgsP3vecCfvm3tAE="}
