If you don't do Win 7 fix, then your movement will not work correctly. [/i]\n\nSo first of all, I'm pretty confident this game is abandonware, E.A. Early Access often really means Early Abandonment. I can't really blame devs though because the VR market is so tough. Most devs won't make the profits they are dreaming about. So some release a game on E.A. with the best of intentions, only to see very few sales. So the motivation to keep improving the game just dries up as hard reality hits the developer. You can't continue working on a game where you aren't making any money (the hours put it versus the money coming in just isn't feasible). Steam really needs to fix E.A. because this happens all too often. There needs to be a carrot and a stick so that devs don't just use E.A. to release unfinished games and test out the market to see if further development is warranted.\n\nAnyways, I finished the game in 48 minutes. This game was released August 31, 2017 and well, is still just as unfinished as the day it was released. So many features coming that never came. You're basically buying a tutorial with 1 level to complete. Everything else was never made. There is fulll locomotion (turning is odd because it's done by location of motion controllers + head tracking seems to effect it as well). There is a comfort mode vignette that you can't turn off when you move. It's not as bad as the negative reviewers would have you believe.\n\nIt's a nice tutorial and 1 level if you can forgive what it isn't. The graphics look good. You can hide in the bushes. You can grab and backstab orc enemies. You can even go toe to toe with 1 or 2 orcs out in the open. You can break street lamps (who knew Orcs needed so much lighting!). You can throw tinder at explosives just laying around a group of Orcs (how convenient). You get to find keys out in the open to release human prisoners. \n\nOkay, so the game isn't great, but it's not bad either. You can see the potential. Just some more stealth mechanics, such as climbing up trees or towers (to plunge down on your enemies). A rock to distract them. Maybe a bow & arrow or some smoke clouds. This could have been an awesome game.\n\nBut we'll never know. I paid $4 and I think I got $4 of content at 48 minutes to finish a game that's mostly a tutorial. They were just really set pieces where you have to assasinate Orcs and/or release prisoners. The tutorial would have been good for a full game. But because game has been abandoned, I can't recommend it. It's a negative / nuetral recommendation. Buy at your own risk.\n\nRate 4.5/10. I can't give a positive, but it's not that bad actually. May be worth the sale price of $4 for some as long as you realize it's been abandoned. What could have been ... dev you had a good game .... should have worked more on it before releasing and you would have made more money","timestamp_created":1530857762,"timestamp_updated":1530857762,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566266417503356934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzfWOt+QCct6rpQE="}
