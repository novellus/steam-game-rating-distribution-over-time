    review: 'I love this game.  I just do.  First of all the art work is magnificent,
      just that funny retro thing that you don''t see much of in VR.  The game is
      still in early access and it seems like it.  It''s a little hard to figure out
      how to get around and what you''re supposed to do..  Not sure why you''re constantly
      starting at level one either..  after a while there''s just wave after wave
      coming at you doing the same stuff, but I''ve not played it for a really long
      time yet so maybe I''m just not proceeding far enough.


      There''s some work to be done to make the game retain the interest of a more
      seasoned gamer, but it''s got something you can''t find just anywhere which
      is a great concept, great visuals and an agreeable environment.  I''d like to
      see more done with the transport options, see the menus become more intuitive
      and maybe have the chance to retain some of my progress, but I''m definitely
      sticking with this one.'
