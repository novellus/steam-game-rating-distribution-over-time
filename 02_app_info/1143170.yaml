    developer_response: Thank you for the concerns raised. The "magic stones" issue
      is a bug which has now been fixed in the latest update. After listening to community
      feedback we have also altered the amount of money received when breaking blocks
      to a more reasonable amount. Thank you for playing.

    review: "This game is quite easy and fun however if you make a mistake in placing\
      \ machinery or conveyors then you have to sell and get almost no money back.\
      \ \nThe system can be automated or you can set up a few systems and just manually\
      \ do it.\n\nPros: \nCheap game,\nEasy,\nFun\n\nCons:\nQuite weird physics,\n\
      \"Magic Stones\" can not be made in assembly 3,\nBonus item also can not be\
      \ made in assembly 3.\nIf all sales are magic stones then you may aswell start\
      \ again as they can not be made.\nAlso no way to report bugs or mistakes.\n\n\
      Edit: They have now fixed these cons and after re-playing I can now change my\
      \ review to positive as I can honestly find no cons for such a cheap game where\
      \ you can get hours of sorting, re-organising and OCD fun from."
