The music is appropriate and non distracting. \n\nIt was a cute bit of fluff. I really like the Butler angle in a romance, so it didn't take much to please me. I finished almost all routes in 34 minutes. I paid 52 cents on this but honestly I've paid 6 times as much for longer VNs that disappointed me anyway. I didn't leave disappointed. Tip for Mr Butler- Don't throw yourself at him until it really counts. OH YA- they also had this awesome mechanic where the MC received letters that told her how to get the happy ending, but they were in code. It was just genius","timestamp_created":1608736074,"timestamp_updated":1608741794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjfaeyPYCdpLAvAI="}
