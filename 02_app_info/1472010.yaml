      notes: Contains non-graphic violence, blood, textual descriptions of sex scenes
        with no graphic nudity, minor nudity, (debatably) non-consensual sex, and
        mentions of suicides. The game is nowhere near as hardcore as all the (forced)
        mature content flags may have you believe.

    review: 'Black Lilies - Eternal Summer is a visual novel about a group of friends
      who are trapped in a time loop of their summer vacation. I was interested in
      it because it takes place more than a decade after the loops began, which is
      different from a lot of time loop stories.


      Because the game was made almost entirely by one person, the presentation is
      pretty basic - each character sprite has a few poses but only one outfit, and
      there are very few CGs. The music is fine but nothing special. I did like the
      map where you could choose what you did each day, but I''m pretty sure that
      until the third section you actually have to do all of the things anyway so
      it creates a sort of illusion of choice. I noticed quite a few typos in the
      text, but no real bugs or glitches.


      The story was fine - I actually really liked the second chapter - but it drags
      on way too long with the main character doing variations on the same thing over
      and over. I liked the main character Alice a lot. That sort of brave, determined
      heroine is one of my favourite types of main character in a VN. That being said,
      most of the other characters are extremely tropey and change personalities quickly
      for the sake of the plot. All of the romances felt tacked-on and weird, especially
      after the way the characters had acted in the first chapter. (For example there
      is one character who grew extremely abusive during the loops and once she''s
      changed her mind it''s all kind of swept under the rug, and the ''villain''
      character does a complete 180 near the end).


      This game does have some cool original ideas and a great main character, but
      it definitely needed some paring down and it can be annoying how much it gets
      so caught up in boring anime tropes. I could only recommend it if you really
      really like time loop stories.'
