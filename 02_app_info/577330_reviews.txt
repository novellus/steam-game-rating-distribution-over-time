I've been a huge fan of beat-em-ups for years. If you too are a genre fan and are fairly tolerant of games' shortcomings, I strongly urge you to avoid this title regardless!\n\nRoad Fist is an unlikely attempt to combine the traditional arcade beat-em-up with contemporary 3rd-person melee-combat action games, namely Dark Souls. The concessions to the latter really increase the difficulty. You have to beat each level one one life, with no health items (at least that I saw), and restart the level when you die. A stamina bar a la Dark Souls decreases each time you attack and slowly regenerates. leaving you unable to attack if it runs out. The only controls are punch, kick, block, and dodge/roll. That's right, no running attacks, no jump button.\n\nThe control scheme really ruins the game. The graphics are fully 3D, and the perspective is level compared to the more elevated perspective of the traditional beat-em-ups. Unlike such fully 3D beat-em-ups as Fighting Force, The Bouncer, or The Rage, the camera is basically fixed and only moves left or right. The controls are absolute rather than relative (i.e. if you push down, your character turns and then runs down no matter which way they were facing). Enemies, however, can attack you not just along the x-axis but from 360 degrees. This gameplay, control scheme, and camera angle do not work well, and the enemies have very precise hitboxes. They can shift position slightly out of your barrage of punches, which demands a fine-tuned adjustment once you notice they're just slightly out of your line of fire. A fine-tuned adjustment, easy with relative controls, is all but mpossible with this type of absolute ones; your character cannot turn in place. Enemies can, but not you. And there's no reason for this. Say you're facing right and press left. Your character will start to turn around, then begin to run up or down in a sweeping semicircle covering more than half of the vertical space until they're running left.\n\nMaybe it's better with a gamepad. The developer has a small note in the features list (and on the options screen) that a gamepad is \"recommended.\"  If the gamepad would make the difference, they should list  \"bloody nigh impossible without a gamepad\" as a feature! I've attempted the first level two dozen times and have only once managed to get past the first five enemies. Not only do you have a single life, but these mooks will drain your life bar as quick as a boss in Final Fight boss if you're not playing it so defensive as to make the game feel like a different genre entirely. There's no reason for the game to be like this. It's as though the developer hardly did any beta testing and was so desperate to add a twist to an established formula that they stripped it of what made the formula fun in the first place. Man, and I really wanted to like it!\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, and the game could have had potential. I try to see the good in these in indie game but can't wrap my head around these design choices. Some beat-em-ups from the golden age and mid 90s admittedly had unfair difficulty/bosses and cheap deaths. Play Road Fist (at least with keyboard and mouse controls), and suddenly Battletoads Arcade seems fair and indulgent. No exaggeration: the melee controls for the original Alone in the Dark felt more userfriendly! Even if you like this type of game and are more skilled gamer than myself, don't be fooled by that fun-looking gameplay video. You'll be disappointed.\n\n Also, sometimes the game will freeze on the main menu, meaning you'll have to go switch to Task Manager to close it. ","timestamp_created":1568107283,"timestamp_updated":1568107283,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o8ieje0CeNP90QE="}
