    review: "I played this game for one hour, so It may be good later. But, I don't\
      \ have the patience. This game could be named \"The errand boy simulator\" because\
      \ the only thing I did was to go fetch whatever anybody wanted, and even that\
      \ was linear. I quit when the guy sent me to bring him some soup for lunch.\
      \ \nIs this really necessary? Can't you start the game with something interesting?\
      \ \n\nAnd user interface is lacking. You should add some shortcuts for (I)nventory,\
      \ (Q)uests, (E)quipement... instead of going through the menu using arrow keys\
      \ every time. The same goes for guess the number mini-game. It could be simple\
      \ as write number, press enter, write number... But no, it is write number,\
      \ press down, press submit, press up, backspace backspase, write number...\n\
      \n\n"
