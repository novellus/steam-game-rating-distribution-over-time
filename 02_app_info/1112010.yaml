      crashland in the jungle? What if, you had to gather your water and food by yourself,
      in order to survive? In Afloat, you can use virtual reality, and see if you've
      got what it takes.<h2 class="bb_tag">About Afloat</h2>You have crashlanded in
      the jungle, and somehow you awake on a raft, with only a grappling gun and a
      tablet with building blueprints beside you. Using your survival skills, you
      have try to make your way back to society. Luckily for you, the river that you
      are following is full of useful resources, that can help you in this endeavour.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Fully in VR</h2>Afloat is a game that can only be played using
      VR headset, to achieve maximum immersion. VR can also have some downsides, like
      motion sickness, and because of this, no teleporting is neccessary in this game.

      on the raft.<h2 class="bb_tag">Current features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Grapple
