Five bucks is pushing it.  It's one map and the roll playing elements are very weak.  One brief conversation with Fox. I do like that they have a paradrop point with supplies for your team.  I would like it much better if your team was sent in with sane equipment in the first place.  Bringing a knife to a gunfight here is quite litteral for Shadow.  Do your sanity a favor and use an editor to hand him a gun.  I do really like the concept of DLC mini missions for JA: BIA but if we could make it 3 maps and a choice of mercs that would be a big improvement.  It would be nice if money was a victory condition as these are mercs.  It would be a sensible trade off if you could get better starting equipment but only by paying for it and bribeing smugglers or something.  Victory level set by how much money you make.  Still it's a fun little map and a chance to play JA without committing to a long campaign.  THAT is very welcome.  It's not a bad team and it's cheap, so it's a worthwild add on.","timestamp_created":1516917599,"timestamp_updated":1516917599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sbXVl+ECduGPlwE="}
