      \ them with MacGuyver-esque traps, and trying to survive wave after wave of\
      \ relentless enemy attacks as they try to break into your fortress and get to\
      \ your precious, precious gold pile. If too many get through, you lose! Whatever\
      \ your strategy is, from building the smallest and most efficient defensive\
      \ fortifications, to building sprawling mega-castles, you will have the freedom\
      \ to approach each challenge in a manner as unique as you are.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ in order to prevent the King's army from retaking the gold! The King will\
      \ send devilishly smart units from his army to retake the stolen gold; they\

    review: "::EDIT::\n\nSince the game has come out of Early Access the developer\
      \ has been hard at work fixing some bugs in the game, as well as making some\
      \ quality of life improvements. The game is still fun and I would recommend\
      \ it to anyone.\n\nAt the time of writing this I am only 30 minutes into the\
      \ game, but this is 100% something I can see myself dumping time into. This\
      \ is a cool take on the Tower Defense genre where instead of just placing traps\
      \ at the random locations given to you, you get to build the structure to suit\
      \ your needs.\n\nA constant need to reload all the traps makes you really think\
      \ about how you are building something, and if you will have enough time to\
      \ go refill the trap and get back in time. \n\nAny issues I found in the game\
      \ I reported to the developer who got back to me right away."
