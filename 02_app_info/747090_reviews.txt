It would be better to have no voice for that line, than to replace her voice with that horrifying robot.\n\n- The first puzzle I did was intentionally designed in such a way that it will randomly be unsolvable, forcing you to restart from the beginning until you get lucky enough that it's in a solvable state at the end. This is because [spoiler]sliding puzzles are not meant to have duplicate pieces. There's no distinguishing between orange block #1 and orange block #2.[/spoiler]\n\n- The second puzzle I did with the pillars and lights bugged out and stopped functioning completely, forcing me to restart the entire game from a new save file. Also, the audio hints had nothing to do with the puzzle, and I had to look up a walkthrough to solve it.\n\nSo far it seems like the game is just padding the playtime hours out with bugs and disrespect for the player's time. Will update review next time I play.\n\nUpdate:\n\n- The third puzzle was fun, but only because [spoiler] it was Minesweeper. I actually had more fun with this Minesweeper variant than any other part of the game.[/spoiler]\n\n- The fourth puzzle wasn't so bad, but then you have to do it five times in a row without saving or quitting. No respect for the player's time.\n\n- The fifth puzzle I did seemed designed to just take up time, not brainpower, to solve.\n\n- The end of the game made me [spoiler]laugh[/spoiler].\n\n- I saw that my playtime exceeded 2 hours, making a refund impossible. From this point of view, the game is an overwhelming success. It was designed to take longer than 2 hours to complete, and that was achieved. Well played, developer.\n\nUpdate 2: \n\n6 months later, I've come back and changed my review to be marked as recommended. The planets and puzzles in this game stuck in my memory. But much more importantly, I can still hear the ship AI's gentle voice in my mind, soothing me in my darkest moments. Her name was Alice...","timestamp_created":1565985512,"timestamp_updated":1582175605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kPrAsPACd9e90AE="}
