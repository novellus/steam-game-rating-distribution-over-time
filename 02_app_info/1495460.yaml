      /><br>Orange Santa is a 2D Christmas-themed Platform Action game based on the
      story of Orange Santa who is in-charge of the distribution of the Christmas
      gifts among the children living in Orange villages.  <br><br>The children of
      the Orange Village are eagerly waiting to celebrate the Christmas with Orange
      Santa. However, the Christmas gifts have not been arranged for distribution
      yet. Tomorrow is the Christmas day and everyone in the village, especially the
      children, are looking forward to celebrate the day. That is where Orange Santa
      plays a significant role and his only mission is to collect the &quot;Octa-coins&quot;
      and buy the gifts from the Special Orange store located in some of the secret
      locations. This is easier said than done because these special coins can only
      be found in some of the secret areas which are under tight security. It is next
      to impossible for a common Orange man to enter the facility. But Orange Santa
      is equipped with a special weapon which is sufficient enough to deal with the
      Fruitus Army. <br><br>You play as Orange Santa and you have less than a day
      in your hand to accomplish your mission. Collect the &quot;Octa-Coins&quot;
      from the enemies, buy the Christmas gifts and distribute them among the children
      of the Orange villages. Will you be able to accomplish your mission? The rest
      is up to you!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1495460/extras/os_gif_1.gif?t=1607580683"
