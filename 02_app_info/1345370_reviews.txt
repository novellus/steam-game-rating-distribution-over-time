I wouldn't be adverse to slightly faster walking in some of those scenes but I get that it's an artistic choice to build towards the culmination of the scene. Overall this game is worth the time and effort it takes to see every scene available. I fully recommend a playthrough.","timestamp_created":1609904727,"timestamp_updated":1609904727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vZTz6vYCeITzwAI="}
