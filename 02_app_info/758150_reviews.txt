It's listed as lite but I see no permanent upgrades. But, that's neither here nor there.\n\nRecently the developer posted an update stating he was no longer [i]legally[/i] allowed to work on this game due to taking a job at a new company. He stated it simply wasn't financially feasible. \n\nNow, I LOVE the way this game looks and I like the way it feels. It's responsive and smooth. I'd love to see this game get completed or at the very least get more updates. The first boss alone is really fun. You must activate a teleporter and defend it from a swathe of robots and a giant mechanical snake. \n\nIt seems like a good foundation for a really phenomenal palette cleanser/time waster. I mean that in the most sincere way. In fact I think it could be something special given proper attention. But at this time (and I will do a new review should anything change) I simply can't recommend this in it's current state with the developer essentially unable to work on it.\n\nI do suggest following it though, should you be a fan of the genre. \n\n[quote]More here â€” [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28295405/]Station Argus[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1525588160,"timestamp_updated":1560511391,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.70887225866317749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40cTuqusCc+3hnwE="}
