The lack of a save feature, short length, clipping issues, and sections where it's hard to see where you're going. But despite that the narrative saves the game. As a walking simulator the story is the most important part so long as its still playable. The story is told in parts and you can chose which part to go to first. Each is filled with character and has a very different feel to it, but it creates a compelling narrative no matter what order you go in.\nThe narrative is quite heavy so if you're not interested in something with a clearly high amount of emotion thrown into it then the story may not be for you. But without saying too much it gets intense and gives the player something to think about. What the game lacks in it's worlds and shallow gameplay it makes up for in how meaty the narrative's themes are.","timestamp_created":1609637760,"timestamp_updated":1609637760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwOH44vYCefL1vwI="}
