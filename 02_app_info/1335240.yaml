    review: "after 40 hours game is in a stall and can't gain much money + too many\
      \ characters with equips that needs upgrading by chests in each 10mission level\
      \ and only 1 equip is upgraded or awakaened to a new higher tier after being\
      \ at max +9\n\nwouldn't buy if you dare to deffy the system it will cost you\
      \ more time on each characters leveled up \nand also you can't put 2 groups\
      \ of people on the same quest to earn more money and such this game is a disgrace"
