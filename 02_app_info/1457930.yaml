    about_the_game: Red Rage combines a gory zombie shooter using simple, easy to
      master controls with a 'red only' art style. Players will fight on a variety
      of maps and fend off zombies to reach higher scores and in turn unlock more
      exciting weaponry. Zombies will attack in waves and sometimes players must be
      willing to fight in the dark with only a flashlight to guide them. A simple
      UI makes for cinematic, heart-racing gameplay with breaks only long enough for
      a reload.

    review: "This game has an unholy amount of potential. Good gameplay, okay graphics,\
      \ and zombie gib. I have some suggestions to the developer(s). \n\nGRAPHICS:\n\
      -Adjust reload animations.\n-Please add on to the maps, these are good looking\
      \ maps with not very much in them.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n-Add an interesting mechanic\
      \ so it sticks out from other zombie shooters. You're on a good path with the\
      \ gun unlocking system, its just that there are also other shooters that have\
      \ this feature. Some features like perks or attachments. I don't see many zombie\
      \ shooters with perks or attachments. Sliding would be nice as well. \n-Remove\
      \ the camera shake when shooting. I would really love to see the dismemberment\
      \ and heads exploding.\n\nZOMBIES:\n-Polish zombie models. While they work,\
      \ I just want something to spice them up. \n-Make different looking zombies.\
      \ Adding a variety of zombie models can help replace the usual gray zombie.\n\
      -This is optional, but making different types of zombies that do different things.\
      \ Like I said, this is optional. I'm pretty happy with the zombies that are\
      \ already in game.\n\nLike I said in my review; this game has SOOO MUCH potential,\
      \ and there is effort there. You are genuinely invested in developing this game.\
      \ \n\nIn this current stage of the game, I rate it a solid 7.5/10."
