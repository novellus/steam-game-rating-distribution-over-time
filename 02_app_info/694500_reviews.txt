Definitely the best Army Men game out of the series without any doubt. Love the voice acting. Unit's AI sucks big time, but enh, it can be ignored. \n\nGame still holds up in terms of play-ability.\nRating: 7/10","timestamp_created":1609850572,"timestamp_updated":1609850572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzsmk6fYCd4XYwAI="}
