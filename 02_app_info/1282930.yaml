    review: "Gioco consigliatissimo. Perch\xE9?      [i]English below[/i]\n\nCostruisci\
      \ una base per la tua squadra.\nGestisci i vari membri affinch\xE9 sviluppino\
      \ amicizie e vari altri bonus utili per:\n  -fabbricazione e miglioramento arsenale;\n\
      \  -avanzamento tecnologico;\n  -migliori prestazioni in battaglia.\nAssembla\
      \ le varie armi sui tuoi sei Volta differenti (con cinque pratici arsenali disponibili\
      \ per ognuno).\nCerca le migliori combinazioni di armi e dei tre membri necessari\
      \ per pilotare un Volta.\nMigliora tramite le battaglie i membri della squadra,\
      \ ognuno con un differente albero delle abilit\xE0 e un talento peculiare.\n\
      Scopri le storie dei personaggi man mano che entrano a far parte della tua squadra.\n\
      Costruisci e migliora le varie armi per sviluppare tecniche di combattimento\
      \ differenti.\nPartecipa ad eventi online con altri giocatori, scala la classifica,\
      \ ottieni emblemi e costumi nuovi.\nIl tutto infuso da una colonna sonora a\
      \ dir poco coinvolgente.\n\nIo l'ho acquistato col 50% di sconto. Sono stati\
      \ fra i 10 \u20AC pi\xF9 ben spesi di sempre.\nNon vedo l'ora che esca il seguito.\n\
      \n[b]ENGLISH[/b]            (Sorry for mistakes. I'm able to speak my mind,\
      \ but my grammar is a bit rusty)\n\nOne of the best game ever. Why?\nIn this\
      \ game you have to fight with your Volta, big robots designed with a little\
      \ bit of nostaglia of Mandrake and Mazinga Z, using peculiar weapons such as\
      \ a Rocket-Punch or a Drill-Missile, but it is not that simple.\nYou have to\
      \ build your party and manage it in your HQ (that you build on your own) to\
      \ maximise differents kind of bonuses and find the better way to use your team\
      \ composed by 3 charachters and your weapons.\nThe possibilities in combat are\
      \ limitless, and so the fun.\nPlus, the soundtracks are simply amazing.\nThis\
      \ game never disappoints. Period.\n\nI spent 10\u20AC, buying it when it was\
      \ on 50% discount. The 10\u20AC better spent in my life so far.\n\n"
