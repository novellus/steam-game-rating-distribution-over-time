The pit isn't clickable, which makes it much easier to learn, but it does have the reworked \"Professional Flight Model\", meaning that the sensors and operation are simplified, but the flight modelling of the plane is on the level of the full modules.\n\nIt's also one of the only FC3 level planes with good tutorial missions. If you follow those you should be able to fly it well in about a week. IMO, it's also a better choice than the F-15C to start out with, as the F-15C has a more cluttered and harder interface, which might distract you during combat. If you'd like to do air-to-air refuelling and carrier ops, think about getting the Su-33 instead, which is a bit more sluggish but also carries more weapons and is carrier-capable.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend getting the Flaming Cliffs 3 module entirely, but if I had to pick a single plane out of it, I'd pick this one.","timestamp_created":1514425381,"timestamp_updated":1514425381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":196,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.940326154232025146","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iK6yzeACc9vukwE="}
