It could do with a little more variety but works well enough. It has a tendency to pressurise the player at key points so if you are ok with that it might be for you. Or you could check out Rick Dangerous. Recommended but only on sale.","timestamp_created":1585442967,"timestamp_updated":1585442967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43fnwkfECf8b7+wE="}
