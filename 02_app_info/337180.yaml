    review: "If arcade-style games like this were available to me when I was a kid,\
      \ where I can play them at home to my heart's content, without the anxiety of\
      \ calculating how many quarters were left in my pocket, I probably would have\
      \ never done any of my homework at all. \n\nThis game is stimulating, frenetic,\
      \ and lovingly addictive. As I get better and faster at the game, it is a joy\
      \ to coordinate the different mechanics: jump, teleport, slide, sprint, shoot\
      \ at the correct angle, etc... I love the heart pumping rhythm of the music\
      \ and the back and forth between space combat and platforming. \n\nAfter finishing\
      \ a level, I happily look at my watch and declare, \"I have time for one more\
      \ level.\" The game is quite accessible, at first, for those who do now have\
      \ skilled video game reflexes. Veterans of arcadia will find that there are\
      \ many opportunities, and rewards, in finishing these levels with improved speed,\
      \ efficiency, and thoroughness. \n\nLt. Kai Tana and her side kick Ralan are\
      \ likeable. The story may not be mind-blowing but it enough for our purposes\
      \ here. Velocity 2x is about fun game play and the story, at the very least,\
      \ does no harm.\n\nI was able to get the game on sale for about $7. For that\
      \ price it was easily worth it for me."
