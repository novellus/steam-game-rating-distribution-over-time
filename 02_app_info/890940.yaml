    review: 'other then the frequant crashes made even worse by lack of save areas,
      the game also has some major flaws


      the starting gear is way to expensive, classes with gender requirements and
      to top it off, all the monster hit for 1/10th of your hp on EASY MODE, most
      people who would play this would quit after a few minutes


      also being a big gamer during the era your trying to replicate, one gear was
      not that expensive in comparison to the gold obtained, monsters did not hit
      for 1/10 of your hp, and most importently there was not gender requirements
      for classes'
