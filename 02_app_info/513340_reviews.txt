I almost didn´t play it because the first game was so awful. It looks way better than the first installment, it has some pretty cool environments and also has way better music! But it´s not without its faults:\nThe puzzles are still just average. There are a lot of doors, and you will find a key for each one. Exept, one key opens two doors...? Clicking your mouse while solving a puzzle will crash the program. This game is just not well thought out.\n The narrative still has way too many boring notes.\n\nThe new environments and the slightly above average music kept me going through. But hidden in plain sight there were some \"Making Of\"-notes near the end of the game. You just solve your way through and all of a sudden notes tell you where the developer got his inspiration from. Point n Click Adventures are all about diving into the setting, and this immersion breaker just broke the seal for me. This is atrocious.\n\nAnd it still has \"made for your phone\" written all over it.","timestamp_created":1604527058,"timestamp_updated":1604527058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxf3QyvUCfJWrrAI="}
