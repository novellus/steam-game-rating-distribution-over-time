    review: 'Very fun for what it is.


      A little wonky, but I figure they''ll get that all worked out before the final
      release.


      I can''t believe there aren''t more games where you can play as a cat, since
      cats power the Internet.


      I also have "Cat''s Yarn", which is all open world, but kinda boring. Very limited
      map and all the same, and you can''t even walk the cat under a parked car, which
      is something cats do when they''re outside.


      Suggestions:

      1. Have the up-high mice worth more than the ones on the ground. Otherwise there''s
      no incentive to risk death and use fuel to get to them.

      2. Have an option to turn off possibility to die. That will make some cat lovers
      sad and they won''t play. Give the option to change that to a time out or loss
      of mice or something.

      3. Give an option (or a cheat) to just skip the levels and go play as a cat
      and run around the map. From the start.


      4. Other music options. The driving metal is fun, but gets old quick. I''d even
      contribute some music free, and I make cool weird stuff. Devs can contact me
      on here.


      Maybe make the non-death option fun, like you have to go run around the open
      world for 5 minutes (maybe as a ghost cat?)
