    review: "This time your entire family is in trouble. Or should I say, will be\
      \ in trouble. See, some time in the future, a plague ravages your family, leaving\
      \ only one survivor: your fifteen-year-old daughter. Since you haven\u2019t\
      \ even found love in your time\u2026 this is indeed interesting. More so, that\
      \ she inherited your ability to visit the past. Which is why she came to you.\
      \ Since she can\u2019t CHANGE the past like you can. Now, can you save your\
      \ family, including yourself?\n\nHO scenes are fun, minigames challenging, and\
      \ the plot engaging. Fully recommend, though get in the bundle."
