    review: 'Snowed IN is a short Yuri (lesbian) visual novel centered around the
      idea of a more technologically-advanced civilization with problems and conflicts
      arising as a result of technology-implemented cyborgs. It takes roughly an hour
      to complete if you''re hoping to achieve all endings to get all achievements
      and has two additional short stories in the Gallery that tell after stories
      from the Good Ending. There are sexual scenes in the main story as well as in
      both of the short stories between the two women and the art is fairly competent.
      This is very clearly not a major work done by a well-off industry but seems
      like a passion project of a small handful of people if not potentially just
      one inspired person.


      There are some issues with the game that I encountered, such as the alleged
      minigame never starting for me and just giving a failure message if even attempting
      the minigame, on one occasion my screen went black and I had to restart the
      game, and I had a crash on another instance. These issues seem to become more
      likely the longer a single play session goes on for and can really sour the
      experience as a whole.


      That being said, these issues happened once each for me and while they were
      enough to make me sigh, I think these issues are bound to happen for a small
      creator. Given the cheap price tag (I bought it for a dollar on sale), I think
      it''s unreasonable to expect an indie team or person to be able to master the
      tools that they work with and I applaud the effort they have made. I hope they
      take the negative criticism they have received and use it to booster their own
      skills later on and I hope to see more work from them.


      Given the plentiful bugs, I suggest grabbing this title on sale like I did.
      It isn''t going to be your favorite visual novel but it''s a fairly unique setting
      they''ve placed the story in and it''s something different to go into.'
