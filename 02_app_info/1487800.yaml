    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Little Hats</h2><br>Little Hats is an open-world
      survival-RPG game, in which you play as a Gnome. The game is mainly inspired
      by old Dutch culture and folklore. The game focuses a lot on exploring, harvesting
      resources, and building with a system that allows the player to be creative.
      You start the game in a magical forest landscape next to a mountain range, and
      as you progress through the game you will have to journey further and further
      away from the mountains and the forest, into a landscape that starts to resemble
      the Netherlands more and more.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Greater Goal Of Little
      Hats</h2><br>In today's fast, and ever-changing new world, where everything
      is striving to become more modern, and climate change appears to form a real
      danger to the ancient country of the Netherlands, I hope to capture certain
      aspects of the old Dutch culture and immortalize them in this game. Along with
      the unique magical style and feel that old Dutch culture and folklore have,
      that I experienced growing up in the Netherlands as a small Dutchman. And I
      believe that putting this into a video game is going to result in a unique and
      magical experience for people all around the world to enjoy.
