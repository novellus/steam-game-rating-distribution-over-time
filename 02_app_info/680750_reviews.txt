But if you like puzzlers take it for granted there's aplenty and I am not judging its quality in that regard as I am not into that sort of pastime.\n\nThis game reminds me of \"Elea\" that I finished some months ago and that is the first and foremost difference: I managed to finish \"Elea\" despite its convoluted nature and unfinished state unlikely to be ever  completed whereas I almost rage quit that one. \"Almost\" meaning I did quit, but with a sigh of relief rather than anything else in the end.\n\nAfter a brief close encounter with a dev I tried to approach whtat's left of the game with an open mind, but in the end I had neither  patience to carry on nor was interested to see what next trick does this puzzler have to throw at me to knock me off-balance. Since it is a puzzler with a very shallow and absurd story behind posing as science-fiction whereas any scientific knowledge we happen to have now - without referring to future possibilities - renders the story basis as purely nonsensical fantasy and not a sci-fi. That was the first factor that put me off quite strongly, the rest just followed. Let's remember what S. King wrote in \"Danse Macabre\" - let me paraphrase that: to have good fiction there must be something allowing us to suspend disbelief.  Poor writing here only did strengthen that in me and now I believe that lack of good script for a credible story is one of a few major problems here - like, for instance, that horrible fetch quest with nine pieces of scrap, just to name another. What fun is to be had in that?\n\nThis is \"The Anatomy of a Disaster part II\", but I loved \"The Fall of Lazarus\", mind you, and really disliked this one from the get-go when I only read those ridiculos premises for the story.","timestamp_created":1595794181,"timestamp_updated":1595794432,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgNSwxvMCcKTclwI="}
