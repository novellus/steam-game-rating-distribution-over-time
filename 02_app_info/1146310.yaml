    review: "Good game 8/10\n\nI'm easy to disappoint when it comes to sequels. And\
      \ in fact this game fails to live up to its predecessor in my humble opinion.\
      \ If this had the story and the dark atmosphere of the first game with modern\
      \ graphics, I would give this a 10/10.\n\nThat being said, I think it's still\
      \ a fun experience with some interesting new mechanics. The story is not bad\
      \ either, I just didn't like the conclusion that much. The end of the first\
      \ game just blew me away. But I guess it's hard to achieve the same effect with\
      \ a sequel. \n\nThe game has its moments, though and I think is well worth your\
      \ time, if you are looking for a classic point and click style adventure. This\
      \ is certainly among the better ones of the past few years.\n\nIf Revolution\
      \ Software makes another sequel, I will buy it, and I wouldn't regret doing\
      \ so, if it's as good as this one. But maybe next time, they should focus on\
      \ a different part of the world they have created instead of Union City. The\
      \ wasteland or some of the other mega cities for example. There's still great\
      \ potential to be tapped into."
