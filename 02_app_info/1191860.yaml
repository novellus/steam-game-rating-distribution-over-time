      Memody, a ''sindrel'' who''s just awoken into life. Sindrels naturally live
      for just six days before a fatal winter claims them, but the opportunity for
      prolonged life presents itself to her. Sindrels have symbiotic creatures in
      their heads - daemons - which provide guidance through life, but Memody''s is
      ''defective'', poisoning her thoughts with constant abuse. Would life eternal
      be desirable if it was shared with an inescapable inner critic? By sharing songs
      with other sindrels and understanding their perspectives on life''s value, she
      might build connections with new friends - and new outlooks - whose light outweighs
      the dark.<h2 class="bb_tag">STORY BEHIND THE STORY</h2>All the game''s content
      - concept, code, graphics, music, writing, etc - was made by a solo developer,
      while recovering from treatment for brain cancer... which he had on top of serious
      mental health issues (severe social anxiety and depression). Both the physical
      and mental brain issues revolved around memory in different ways: a big part
      of the social anxiety is being haunted by (often objectively trivial) memories
      of social embarrassment, and the major brain surgery to treat the tumour presented
      the risk of permanent memory loss. This game explores the dark and light sides
      of memory, both in an attempt to reduce or prevent that memory deterioration,
      and to make peace with inner demons.<br><br><br>If nothing else, hopefully it''s
      inspiring. If someone can do this alone with both mental illness and brain cancer,
      then surely you can achieve your goals if you put your mind to them!<br><br><br>This
      is the first of several games that''ll be set in a world called Alora Fane.
      If you appreciate deep, characterised - and funny! - dialogue in games, and
      novel world lore, there should be a lot in this for you!'
