I reccommend getting it if you are a naruto fan hoping to get it legally as most websites also only offer the english dub.","timestamp_created":1499291728,"timestamp_updated":1499291728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiIewit0CdoOAfw=="}
