    review: 'UPDATE August 22. 2020


      The dev changed a lot of things in updates and the gunsounds are now real shots.
      I played it again and it is really cool now. The graphics are still strange,
      but it fits to the game. Check the new gameplay video. I can honestly say now,
      it is a fun game for a cheap price.



      OLD REVIEW


      It is a wave-based shooter and ok, i have fun playing it. But there are too
      many things i dont like in the moment. The graphics are bad and wobbeling, the
      gunsounds are just a spoken phews. Because of both this, it is too less fun
      for me, and if it is humour, i do not like it. But maybe you, so just watch
      my gameplay video and see for yourself.
