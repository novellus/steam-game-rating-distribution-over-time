    review: "Boring, characterless, ugly and often annoying enemies. Similarly characterless\
      \ maps. Pointless gimmicky voxel art design. Depressing tuneless ambient music\
      \ and/or depressing generic \"heavy\" rock, depending on the area.\n\n[b]**The\
      \ shooting's decent but any potential is smudged by the drab setting and the\
      \ painfully amorphous enemies.**[/b]\n \nSo, you have your map, which you traverse\
      \ gaily and while double jumping merrily on your way, you set off switches,\
      \ grab spawn triggering objectives, funnel enemies into choke points and roller\
      \ bomb the poo out of them. This is doctor jekyll.\nThen, you have the power\
      \ node fights. You need to complete these to unlock the next area. These ...\
      \ are Mr Hyde. They section you off (you can leave but it resets the fight)\
      \ on a small part of the map while things run at you, shoot at you, look meanly\
      \ at you etc. etc. (Sound familiar? Yea, I bet it does) until through furious\
      \ dodging and skilful aim, you emerge the victor .. or .. maybe you just find\
      \ a ledge where they can't reach you and roller bomb the poo out of anything\
      \ that can't fly. Regardless, you might fare 10 x better with a particular weapon\
      \ due to a certain enemy type but you won't know that the first time and you'll\
      \ probably die, which will reset the whole map, which you will need to traverse\
      \ (gaily) again to get your loot back .. and you better not die this time or\
      \ you will lose it all. Now, you don't want this because you're going to need\
      \ that loot (and probably more - hello grind) to make the weapon, to kill the\
      \ thing, that put you in this loop ... tralalalala. It's not actually as grindy\
      \ as it sounds but it is as boring as it sounds.\nThis kind of cycle might be\
      \ alright if you felt there was any pay off coming or if it was entertaining\
      \ .. but there isn't and it's not .. and unfortunately the rpg elements mainly\
      \ boil down to keeping your gear levelled up. You can add health or speed or\
      \ resistances and some other \"stuff\" but it doesn't quite spice things up\
      \ enough.\n\nThe dev does patch it a lot and it has seen improvements but I'd\
      \ say, if it piques your interest, get it before the promised price hike and\
      \ preferably with a discount. It does scratch a shootery itch (as you can see\
      \ from my play time) but with hindsight I can't recommend it. Your time could\
      \ be being killed in a much more engaging manner, for a similar price.\n\n[u][b]Updated;[/b][/u]\
      \ 11/20:\nThe above review still stands. However, a recent patch seemingly has\
      \ laid to rest the excruciating frame drops that have ruined the game since\
      \ day one. This means that you can now move around and aim at pace with confidence\
      \ - y'know like you should have been able to, for the last year. This does somewhat\
      \ counter some of the boring and generic aspects mentioned above but not enough\
      \ to change to a recommend yet. Also, [b][i]STILL NO CLOUD SAVE.[/i][/b]"
