    review: "[h1]Written in the Sky - a Sophisticated Review[/h1]\n\n[strike]This\
      \ game is utter crap.[/strike] Oh pardon me, did I just say game? \nIt's a poor\
      \ excuse for a visual novel. This visual novel is utter crap. Hmmmm... It is\
      \ visual. But a novel? Nah. \n\nThe \"story\" is too superficial and the characters\
      \ are barely even existing as such. You \"play\" as Azure, a japanese (at least\
      \ I assume so) schoolgirl that looks like 10 albeit actually being 18 (what\
      \ a coincidence). She is bored, her life is crap. Typical teenager stuff. But\
      \ also she is borderline stupid and has a rather interesting relationship with\
      \ her father, who she kind of loves (her mom is dead boohoo) but also kind of\
      \ despises (he gets \"angry\" for her bailing on school). She isn't even sure\
      \ herself. But meh, life goes on and so she decides to sneak out. Though various\
      \ mischiefs caused by her sheer stupidity she gets to meet a girl from another\
      \ planet: the Queen of Mars. Another borderline stupid character that constantly\
      \ changes her motivation and presents a poorly written plot about some war on\
      \ Mars.\n\nSkip.\n\nAnd then finally, after about 20 minutes of stupid, poorly\
      \ written \"dialogues\" and \"characters\" and lots of tootling \"music\", you\
      \ get to why you downloaded this \"game\" ahem \"visual novel\" (IT'S FREE!!!!(thank\
      \ god)) : the obligatory yuri sex scene. It's OK actually, compared to the rest\
      \ of this \"beautiful experience\". But if you're a fan of yuri stuff- and I\
      \ mean REAL yuri stuff- then it's also garbage. It feels like something written\
      \ by a porn-addicted 15-year-old who you imagine gulping down his saliva every\
      \ now and then whilst figuring out the words to write.\n\nIf you decided to\
      \ make your own \"visual novel\" it would probably come out more than just better\
      \ written. You'll enjoy it more and you would have accomplished something instead\
      \ of just having wasted your time. Don't get me wrong, the two girls in Written\
      \ In The Sky are rather attractive and some of the backgrounds look decent but\
      \ this changes nothing.\n\nWritten in the Sky is not a game. It is not a visual\
      \ novel. There is no interactivity whatsoever. Most of the backgrounds look\
      \ like crap, the music is irritating to say the least, the big pink text box\
      \ covers up the t***ies and the writing is beyond awful. But you get to \"play\"\
      \ for only half an hour to get the two achievements. That's cool.\n\nSo what\
      \ is Written in the Sky exactly?\n\nEhm... Visual.... Pulp.... fan-fiction-like?\
      \ This really is a tough question. It'd be best if you see for yourself. It\
      \ barely even lasts for half an hour. But half an hour actually is a long time\
      \ you could spend doing something else. In fact I procrastinated on studying\
      \ in order to \"play\" this. \n\n2/10 because I like yuri lol\nand also the\
      \ trailer is really funny - probz to those who made it\n\n[h1]WARNING: DO NOT\
      \ TRY THIS AT HOME[/h1]"
