Finished all missions in just a couple of days though, which isn't worth the 30.00 paid.\n\nDecent graphics, some quirks. Controls require that you use game controller and keyboard in order to be able to get the use of all capabilities. And then still couldn't control throttle properly.\n\nThere is an editor included so you can make different missions if yo can figure out how to get the system to save your map editing .\n\nOver all game 6 of 10\nGraphics 6 of 10\nAudio 4 of 10 (not from the game play but the computer voice that hosts)\nControls 5 of 10\n\nOur total is a 5. Not recommended for the price. 10.00 would be appropriate.","timestamp_created":1608061549,"timestamp_updated":1608061549,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nP/7s/YCfvHCugI="}
