    review: 'Incredible skill-based platformer.


      It''s controls are great (comparable to The End is Nigh but much faster paced),
      the levels are all interesting and fun to play, and there is loads of content
      (and a level editor!). The levels are designed more like puzzles than other
      platformers of this type, but they are always the interesting type and there
      is still a strong focus on execution. If you enjoy hardcore platformers such
      as Super Meat Boy or Celeste then I would recommend this game.


      My one criticism would be that the level select UI is a bit janky (which is
      separate from the story mode which uses a hub world), although I assume this
      is getting updated as the game is currently in Early Access.


      Edit: Game now has a level editor AND a level exchange to share the levels.'
