Eventually my whole life will be ported to steam... One can hope...\n\nCrime Cities is a very old game, and somewhat of a hidden gem. Now, its not mind-blowing or amasing or anything, but i do remember having an awful lot of fun with it.\nThen again, children have a lot of fun with many things... But i did replay this game like 10 times throughout my life, so... \n\nThe game's premise is relatively simple, and also very old-school type of badass.\nThere's a solar system that was turned into a series of prison-planets, each containing its very own set of convicts. Something suspicious is happening in this shithole, and a covert operative (you) gets sent here to figure out what's going on before its too late.\n\nYour only way of interacting with the world is driving a flying car, which also happens to be armed to the teeth. The game is open-world so you can go and have yourself some carnage fun (remember getting 5 stars at GTA? You kinda can do this here. Kinda...)\n\nOther than that you're meant to go to one of the garage-ish spots where you interact with a wonky menu with VERY weird choices for controls. INS and DEL buttons, i think? I honestly forgot. But its in there, somewhere.\nYou get to pick yourself a contract (mission / quest) and do it. \nThe main story ones advance the story, the secondary missions provide you with money to upgrade your car: get better guns, shields, etc.\n\nBut other than that: many missions are amazing sources of world-building. Contracts for radical zealot groups of all kinds, criminals, just weirdos doing weird shit... All kinds of people live on a prison-world, and you get to work for them for cold-heart cash.\n\nI'm pretty certain some missions are even LITERALLY and INTENTIONALLY unwinnable, as your contractor gets lost or dissapears or maybe something worse - never to be seen again, and the player have no choice but to go back to the garage, scared and kinda ashamed for his inability to finish this mission, actually CANCEL the contract yourself and never speak of it again.\n\n[i]No, i don't know any weird alien conspiracy enthusiasts, why are you asking me this?[/i]\n\nThe only piece of criticism i have is the before mentioned questionable choice for controls, so some getting used-to-it might be required to genuinely enjoy the game.\nThere's also a weird, uh... \"ADVERTISIMENT\" system where you get spamed with in-game world advertisiments like, uh... Painting your car? I had NEVER in my life figured out if you can actually interact with those and do something, or if they are actually just literal spam in your in-game inbox.\nVery immersive, i tell ya. It's just like having an actual e-mail!\n\nI wish this game got some kind of a remaster or a spiritual successor. There's some nice potential here. Especially seeing how retro sci-fi theme are ressurging back into the mainstream.","timestamp_created":1594311708,"timestamp_updated":1594312063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.681631624698638916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ge+ZmvMCcK6LlAI="}
