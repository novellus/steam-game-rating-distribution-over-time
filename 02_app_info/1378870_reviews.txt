It’s been really tough finding a game that is both immersive and easy to pick up, but still feels rewarding in spite of the little time you put into it.\n\nIn the House of Silence is an interesting mix of mechanics and aesthetics. It’s like if you took the art style and atmosphere of Don’t Starve, mixed that with the item building mechanics of the Binding of Isaac, and threw it all together with some traditional turn-based roguelike gameplay. It’s really fun and strangely addictive! \n\nI feel there is huge potential here, and I really hope the developer is able to keep expanding things throughout Early Access.\n\nAs of right now (0.3a), there are about 5-6 floors and no bosses, just normal mobs. There is no in-game tutorial yet (apart from a “how to play” text screen on the menu), but the game is simple enough to pick up within a few minutes.  Movement is turn-based in 4 directions (no diagonal movement) and attacking simply involves pressing the directional key towards enemy. There are currently no character levels, equipment or stats, but you pick up a bunch of interesting mutations and simple one-use items (health pots, teleports, shields etc.) which enable you to evolve your character and playstyle. Mutations include things like double movement, more damage when low sanity, item drops on mob death etc. and help spice things up and keep things engaging. Although the start can be tough, once you get a few mutations it feels very satisfying to play and watch everything work together. \n\nOverall, I actually found the combat quite forgiving in comparison to the sanity mechanic, as every step decreases your sanity and there is a bit of RNG in whether you get enough items or mutations to alleviate it throughout the levels. If your sanity drops to zero 3 times (the bar shortens every time, too), it’s game over.\n\nThe current line-up of monstrosities are well designed and combat in general is very fair. All monsters have some attack or movement pattern, or fit within a specific niche - i.e., ultra low health but super high damage. Depending on what mutations you find and what items you have will depend on what mobs remain dangerous and also how many you can tackle at once. Unless you're stacking a bunch of rare mutations and items, taking on more than 2 almost always ends in death (but hey, that's roguelikes for you!).\n\nAlthough I’ve been having a lot of fun with this and I can appreciate the simplicity of the game, I think it could also end up being the game’s biggest weakness. I know more mutations, enemies and levels will likely come in time, but I still feel the game may be missing that one extra layer of complexity which helps it stand the test of time. As there are no character levels, stats, armour, spells or weapons, it’s only really the mutations and mob/level arrangement that changes each run, so adding more of this is just kind of stretching it out, rather than making it deeper. I think the game could really benefit from some extra layers of mechanics to make runs even more interesting and to give players a little more flexibility over their playstyle. \n\nThe floors also feel a bit empty right now. The game could really use more interactive elements and reasons to explore past just the exit. Lore snippets, friendly NPCs, secret rooms/tunnels, high risk high reward encounters and random collectables. \n\nAll in all, I’m really excited to see how this game evolves! It’s a little bare-bones right now, so if you’re expecting hours and hours of content I’d say hold off until later in the EA period. If you’re like me, and don’t have a ton of time anyway, and are looking for an enjoyable and easy to pick up roguelike, I highly recommend it!","timestamp_created":1607968610,"timestamp_updated":1607968631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562417685985565186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jcWZsfYCdqaYugI="}
