    developer_response: Hello, thank you  for your feedback. Please, remember that
      the game is still in early access. Considering your suggestions, we've added
      a full screen button permanently . BTW did you use the panel in the elevator
      to get an 23 floor or just click on the map?

    review: 'For me it was a big let down. could not get a full screen, it was in
      a little window on a full screen, your bar in the top right hand corner  went
      down too fast. woke up, got to work and went to level 23 and it was on 0. the
      game keeps turning it self off, but it dose save the game for you so you don''t
      need to start all over again.


      I did play for 3 hrs but am sorry i will not be buying the game.'
