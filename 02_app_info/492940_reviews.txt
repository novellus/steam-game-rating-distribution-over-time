This is one of the most fun tracks in the game.  Kim Deal is a fun bass player to watch, and this track shows some of that flair: there's lots of fret jumping instead of string switching.  Your first time through, your hand will be flying all over the place, but once you get the hang of it, it's a really fun and expressive way of keeping the beat.","timestamp_created":1570545930,"timestamp_updated":1570545930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8aH11e0CffTg0wE="}
