It paved the way for my love of escape games. \n\nImagine my excitement when I saw that Takagism was back with a Crimson Room.... sequel/remake/tribute/something. \n\nIt's just... not very good by today's standards. It is still a bit pixel hunt-y. There are interactions that don't immediately make sense. In fact if you do play this, you must go into it assuming that this is not reality. A certain puzzle element occurs that you may not notice because there's no real connection between the two things until you notice it by chance.\n\nIt's really a click everything and hope it works sort of scenario, except if you remember the original crimson room then you'll know a few of the steps that make a return.\n\nThere's about an hour of gameplay here. I got this for 3 bucks on sale. It was a nice nostalgia trip but ultimately a disappointment. If Takagism wants to move forward with Viridian Room, I hope it's better than this.","timestamp_created":1589274727,"timestamp_updated":1589274744,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546525299549102783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzIKKhPICe8KbhwI="}
