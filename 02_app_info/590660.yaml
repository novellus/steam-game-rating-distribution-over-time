      4 types of stores:<br><br>1 Clothing store.<br>2 tool shop.<br>3 car materials
      shop.<br>4 Computer store.<br><br>You start an old store of your grandfather,
      he is already old and can no longer take care of the store.<br>Now YOU get the
      chance to show what you can do.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/590660/extras/personeelENG.png?t=1572858852"
      /><br><br>Caring for staff without staff will be difficult.<br>You have to hire
      staff. You can decide for how long.<br>If you dismiss staff while they have
      a contract, you will be charged that extra money.<br>If the staff are ill, you
      can not dismiss them.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/590660/extras/inkoopENG.png?t=1572858852"
      /><br><br>Every store needs products to sell.<br>You can buy at 4 different
      factories.<br>1 America<br>2 Europe<br>3 Asia.<br>4 Africa<br>each factory has
      its specific characteristics<br>With America, the quality is higher than with
      the others.<br>But with Africa the purchasing price is very cheap<br>but that

      /><br><br>The sale depends on your staff, you have no staff then will the sale<br>also
      not very high.<br>The sales price you set for a product also determines how
      many sides you can get.<br>Finally, why pay so much more for the product, if
      you can get cheaper at competitors.<br>So if you go for the maximum profit on
      a product, it is possible that the customers stay away.<br>Your store reputation
      is very important, it determines among other things how many customers you can
      expect.<br>If the reputation is very low, you can assume that not many customers
      will come.<br><br><img src="{STEAM_APP_IMAGE} /extras/finENG.png" crossorigin="anonymous"/><br><br>You
      can see per week how well your store has done.<br>All your fixed costs such
      as insurance, rent, tax, gas, light and water.<br>Are depreciated per week.<br>Like
      wages, advertising costs.<br>The most important thing is what you keep at the
      end of the week.<br>The bank is your friend, as long as you pay.<br>Little red
      standing is not bad, but keep an eye on the bank meter.<br>Only when it comes
      in the red, you really have to be careful.<br>Because before you know it, the
      bank closes YOUR store doors for good.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/590660/extras/ramoENG.png?t=1572858852"
      /><br><br>You may have to deal with sick staff, which in turn affects your sales.<br>You
      can also encounter theft, flooding, broken cash registers, and much more.<br>So
      do not spend all your money, keep some back on hand for an emergency.<br><br>Are
      you the person we are looking for your grandfather's shop or should we find
      someone else ...
