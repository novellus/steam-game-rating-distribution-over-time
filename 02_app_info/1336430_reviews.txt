There is no artificial difficulty where zombies gain more health as the waves progress, only more types of interesting zombies that are original in design.\nThe upgrade system between waves is simple and rewarding but you may find that some upgrades aren't worth taking over others.\nThe animations are so well blended into the greyscale environment, everything is clear and easy to see.\nGood music too.\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1608935807,"timestamp_updated":1608935807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gYODzvYCc92YvQI="}
