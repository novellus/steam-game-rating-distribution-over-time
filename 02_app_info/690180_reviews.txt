The arcade machines and home consoles of the 1980s were limited by those systemsâ€™ rudimentary sound chips, but as tech improved and game developers started to build more enveloping worlds, the music grew more elaborate, too. Composers began creating entire scores spanning classical, techno, jazz, and more. Sports titles like FIFA and open-world games like Grand Theft Auto started licensing hit songs, further blurring the lines between the game world and our real one. Today, video game soundtracks can be as evocative and detailed as those in films, offering powerful listening experiences on their own.\n\nThis one is very post-apocalyptic. \n\nVery atmospheric. \n\nA great way to show your support to a great developer.","timestamp_created":1607478354,"timestamp_updated":1607534066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.649673044681549072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwleefpPYCfvSmuAI="}
