      \ my list; the graphics, background images and music are okay, the gameplay's\
      \ the same as all the holiday themed aMAZE games. Worst of all, despite being\
      \ store-bought, the Achievements don't count towards the \"Perfect Games\" for\
      \ your profile, so all your tedious efforts will virtually be for nothing and\
      \ the game developers won't do a thing about that. \U0001F612"
