    review: "This is not a learning tool. You need a basic understanding and knowledge\
      \ of Kana in order to play this game.\nThere are no lessons, study cards, nothing\
      \ in the game that would actually teach you what each Kana are. Not even a JPEG\
      \ of the Hiragana and Katakana alphabets for you to learn from. \n\nEven when\
      \ you get the answer wrong, the game says out loud which answer you pressed,\
      \ but does not show you the kana which would have been the correct answer. So\
      \ for an example, if the game wants you to pick \"Mi\", and you pick \"Hi\"\
      , the game will say out loud \"Hi\", and you take damage. Then the game moves\
      \ on. There is no opportunity here to learn other than trial and error, which\
      \ is not very effective or fun.\n\nThere is no bonus reward for choosing the\
      \ answer quickly, nor does there seem to be a penalty for taking your time,\
      \ as the zombies only seem to damage you when you choose the wrong answer. \n\
      No time trial mode, survival mode, anything of the sort. You choose a difficulty,\
      \ but going for a harder difficulty at the beginning is nearly impossible, no\
      \ matter how good your Kana knowledge is, since for some reason the difficulty\
      \ raises the hit points of the zombies and due to the weapon system, you will\
      \ not be able to do much damage. I understand the \"idea\" behind this mechanic,\
      \ but I don't understand how it is supposed to be fun or educational in any\
      \ way.\n\nPro mode, which mixes both Hiragana and Katakana choices gives no\
      \ additional rewards to the players, but it is the most fun mode of the three\
      \ to play. \n\nThis game might be fun if you're at a very specific period in\
      \ your studies, where you have already studied and learned most of the Kana\
      \ and want a quick way to test your memory, but even for that, there are better\
      \ alternatives."
