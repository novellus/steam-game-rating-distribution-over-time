It has the same style and reuses the same sound effects and music. It's longer than Huntsville, but amount of scenes to search the items for is about the same - you just have to go through the same locations again and again. There are 20 prime suspects to investigate and about 25 different locations. With each suspect you have to search 6-7 locations, which means some of them repeat a lot.  Also, the same as in Huntsville, there is a time limit and if you run out of time you have to go through the same locations again. Basically in later stages of the game it becomes more of a memory game - you don't search for items, you just remember there they are.\nThe graphics feels dated and the game works on 800x600 screen resolution, which makes some smaller items really hard to spot.\nAlso the game doesn't work fullscreen on Windows 10. You have to manually set desktop resolution to 800x600 before running the game. You can run it In a windowed mode, but I found it practically unplayable this way - items are just too small to spot.","timestamp_created":1607598426,"timestamp_updated":1607598426,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+aiVpvYCcd3VuAI="}
