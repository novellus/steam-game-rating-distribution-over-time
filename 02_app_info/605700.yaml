      centuries, titans bestrode the world, colossal heads and shoulders lost in the
      clouds, carelessly smashing and crushing all beneath. When the youngest of them
      had enough and declared war on their ancient parents, even the land itself suffered.
      These scars of the Divine War, which ended less than 200 years ago, have still
      not healed.<br><br>One such scar is the Chasm of Flies, a rent in the earth
      created when the titan Spiragos the Ambusher was smote down by one of the young
      gods, Vangal the Ravager. Now, the Chasm is inhabited by spider-eye goblins
      and their spider allies, but it is also thought to be the resting place of powerful
      artifacts from that elder age.</i><br><br>&quot;Gauntlet of Spiragos&quot; is
      a Scarred Lands adventure designed for 1st level characters, although it can
      be easily modified for characters of up to 5th level.<br><br>Released on March
      06, 2017. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.2.2 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requires:</strong>
      An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate
      license and the included PFRPG (3.5E Compatible) Ruleset.
