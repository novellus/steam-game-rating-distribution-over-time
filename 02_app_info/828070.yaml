      \ /><br><br>The battle between the Hero and the Demon King has come to an end\
      \ and the world was at peace.  However, with monsters still wreaking havoc,\
      \ humans teamed up with Demons to subdue the rampaging monsters. In this peaceful\
      \ world, there lived a Treasure Hunter, the protagonist, Claire. Hearing a rumor\
      \ of a treasure that could grant any wish, Claire traveled to the fabled land\
      \ of Alstroemeria. Word of the treasure being in Alstroemeria had caused it\
      \ to explode with activity. And Claire was not alone, as many other adventurers\
      \ also came in search of the treasure. She arrived in the town that acted as\
      \ a staging ground, and as she walked through it, she came across a mysterious\
      \ shop and met its owner.<br><br>She introduced herself as Milith, and said\
      \ that there was treasure at the shrine in the temple to the north.  Claire\
      \ didn\u2019t fully trust her, but with no other leads, she decided to investigate.\
      \ The temple had an ethereal air about it and gave off a strange aura. Regardless,\
      \ Claire finally arrived at the shrine in the back of the temple. She found\
      \ something that seemed to be a treasure and grabbed it, only to be enveloped\
      \ in bright light. Before she knew what was happening, Claire found herself\
      \ face to face with a beautiful woman. She introduced herself as the Goddess\
      \ that protects the island and said that Claire had the power of the Hero within\
      \ her. She said that while everyone was scrambling for treasure, a villain who\
      \ sought to bring the world to ruin had also begun to search for it.<br><br>And\
      \ so, she wished for Claire to obtain the treasure before the villain.  The\
      \ Goddess said that she believed that the blood of the Hero was lying dormant\
      \ within Claire. While performing a ceremony to awaken it, Claire could feel\
      \ the Hero\u2019s power swelling within her. It was most certainly the power\
      \ of the Hero. The Goddess explained that the Hero\u2019s power could be strengthened\
      \ by gathering life essences. Claire would need to gather essences to power\
      \ up. Despite this, Claire vowed to keep searching for the treasure to obtain\
      \ her wish. And so began her exciting journey with her friends to obtain treasure!<br><br><strong>Experience\
