    review: Swatch Out is a very entertaining game. While it is aimed towards kids
      and young ones, it still pulled me in with the gameplay that makes you mix and
      choose the right colors to defeat enemies and progress. It is a fairly challenging,
      yet rewarding fun little game. It is aimed towards children which helps them
      learn about colors and thinking skills to defeat enemies. However, this sweet
      little gem pulled me in and I recommend it not only for children, but for people
      who like a fun little nostalgic game that reminds them of their future, while
      being fun.
