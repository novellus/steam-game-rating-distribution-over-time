    about_the_game: "Moderium is a Wave-Based Isometric Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG)\
      \ where players are given vast customization over their combat capabilities\
      \ through the unique Modification system. Players will enter various realms\
      \ and fight back waves of enemies of varying power to gain experience and equipment\
      \ to further their abilities. The difficulty encountered is at the hands of\
      \ the player through manually setting the initial level of enemies to fight\
      \ which allows for more casual or edge-of-seat gameplay. With 10 Classes, 4\
      \ Skill Trees, 52 Skills and 59 Sets available at launch the path of which you\
      \ choose to defeat your enemies is up to you.<br><br>Moderium focuses around\
      \ the concept of customization while retaining accessibility without removing\
      \ depth of gameplay.<br><br>\t<strong><u>Feature Summary</u></strong><br>- Customizable\
      \ skills to play as you choose.<br>- Randomly generated equipment with the opportunity\
      \ to target crafting specific pieces.<br>- New Secondary Stats to offer meaningful\
      \ equipment management and build diversity.<br>- Class variety with gameplay\
      \ impact.<br>- Roguelike and Incremental elements to allow rewards for time\
      \ commitment while furthering character development beyond max level.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>\t\
      <strong><u>Features Detailed</u></strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong><u>SKILLS</u></strong><br>Each\
      \ skill is composed of the Base Skill, 5 Modifiers and 2 Stages. This allows\
      \ for a diverse approach to combat. Leveling grants a skill point, which can\
      \ be used to unlock and modify the effect of a skill. As 5 points are allocated\
      \ into a skill the Second Stage is unlocked, adding a passive benefit to the\
      \ skill, after 10 points the skill's Third Stage is unlocked. One player may\
      \ use Fireball to light enemies on fire, dealing damage over time; while another\
      \ may use Fireball to regenerate mana on impact. Of course a third individual\
      \ may choose to go all out with a Fireball that pierces enemies, regenerating\
      \ mana, lighting enemies on fire and creating more Fireballs (called Fractures)\
      \ on impact.<br><br>In addition to the customization found within each skill\
      \ several skills within the same way will interact with one another if the player\
      \ so chooses. An example of this being the Fire Skill Tree's Embers skill which\
      \ by defaults increases the Fire Damage afflicted enemies take for a duration\
      \ while the &quot;Firestorm&quot; modifier allows each hit to have a chance\
      \ to cast a Fireball Fracture (free of cost) at each target hit.<br><br>\t\t\
      \t\t\t\t<strong><u>ITEMS</u></strong><br>Moderium incorporates a Rarity-based\
      \ loot system with a twist. The vast majority of items will grant &quot;Damage&quot;\
      \ which is used to improve the offensive capability of your character, and depending\
      \ upon the rarity can offer additional benefits such as:<br><br>Epics - Grant\
      \ Damage, 1 Primary Stat (Strength, Intelligence or Agility) and 3 Secondary\
      \ Stats (Critical Hit Chance, Haste, Overflow).<br>Relics (Commonly known as\
      \ &quot;Legendaries&quot;) - Grant Damage, 1 Primary Stat, 2 Secondary Stats\
      \ and free points to at least 2 Modifiers (Can add up to 5 points to all 5 Modifiers)\
      \ for a specified skill.<br><br>Pair this with new Secondary Stats to add more\
      \ variety to builds and a crafting system that allows you to designate exactly\
      \ what Primary and Secondary Stats your item will have, as well as the level\
      \ of the item and the depth of character customization becomes realized. But\
      \ wait - There's more!<br><br>Moderium has redesigned the approach to equipment\
      \ sets that augment your character, focusing on adding an extra element of gameplay\
      \ and customization as opposed to stacking 3-6 pieces for a simple numerical\
      \ buff which doesn't feel impacting to gameplay. Sets in Moderium are broken\
      \ apart into individual bonuses, requiring a specific number of each set piece\
      \ to unlock and which pieces are active is completely up to the player, with\
      \ a default of 3 sets being active at a time.<br><br>A Pyromancer may choose\
      \ to activate the Flaring Repitition (Conflagrate's Damage Over Time now stacks),\
      \ Flamecaller's Gift (Fireball redirects back at the player when completing\
      \ it's path) and Igntion (Passively applies &quot;Ignite&quot; at full strength\
      \ every few seconds to a nearby enemy.) The power of your character is further\
      \ boosted by sets that the player chooses to mix together - And these sets are\
      \ not an alternative to the default equipment so they will not interfere with\
      \ Epics or Relics that are equipped.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong><u>SCALING</u></strong><br>Moderium\
      \ aims to be accessible by all and to remain as free of frustration as possible.\
      \ To this end it is impossible to be 1-shot, insta-gibbed, deleted or otherwise\
      \ obliterated by a single enemy hit. As the player's level rises from level\
      \ 1 all the way to 100 the damage of ALL enemies will scale and reach a cap.\
      \ At Player Level 100 a level 5 enemy and a level 50,000 enemy will hit just\
      \ as hard - The difference is their health. As the level of enemies raises their\
      \ health begins to scale more dramatically, requiring more precise skill point\
      \ allocation; luckily the player can scale too - Enter Enhancement. Upon reaching\
      \ level 100 the player may &quot;Enhance&quot; which destroys all equipped and\
      \ inventory items, returning the player to level 1 and resetting all Skill Points\
      \ (Sets are carried over) while granting 10 extra skill points immediately -\
      \ This process is repeatable.<br><br>The challenge in Moderium moves away from\
      \ the ARPG standard of avoiding having your health depleted instantly while\
      \ focusing on more active and entertaining aspects - How to boost your damage\
      \ to defeat higher level enemies before becoming overwhelmed."

    review: Very fun game with a lot of different skills that interact nicely. Developer
      is actively supporting it; When I was unable to launch the game, he responded
      to my email within ~5 minutes. After ~10 minutes a fix was released and verified.
      Insanely fast! Kudos!
