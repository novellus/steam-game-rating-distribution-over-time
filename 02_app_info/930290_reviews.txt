There's not much to it but it is still satisfying to play and has good graphics, music, and runs smoothly. It has potential for things to be added but as it is, it is a short adventure, great for when you need something a bit lighter.","timestamp_created":1569076541,"timestamp_updated":1569076541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45P6Pqu0Ce+nQ0gE="}
