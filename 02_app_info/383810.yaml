    review: 'If you are no good at voice acting, and can''t afford to get proper voice
      actors, then just leave the voices out completely; it''s fine, the old games
      that this one claims to be inspired by didn''t have voice overs anyway.


      I wasn''t impressed by this game in any way. The visuals are not bad but the
      gameplay is basic and takes far too many cues from ''rage'' games, throwing
      enemies and pitfalls at the player that they couldn''t reasonably be expected
      to avoid without prior knowledge. The level design is run-of-the-mill and requires
      pixel perfect positioning to avoid damage from enemy attacks.


      Overall I just didn''t find the game rewarding or enjoyable; I was sick of it
      within 20 minutes. There are plenty of these ''retro inspired'' platformers
      on Steam and most of them are better and cheaper than this. Go play one of those
      instead.'
