    about_the_game: '&quot;Shardpunk: Verminfall&quot; is an upcoming indie tactical
      squad-based survival strategy game, based in a steampunk setting. Gameplay-wise,
      it is a mix of XCOM and Darkest Dungeon games, mixing all the best features
      from both. All of this is presented using great pixel art graphics.<br><br>The
      game is currently being developed as a side project.<br><br>Backstory: there
      has been an unexpected breakthrough during long and exhausting siege of The
      Empire''s Capitol. Rat Swarm managed to breach the walls and flooded the city
      with vermin. Group of survived city dwellers are trying to escape - and possibly
      rescue some additional people, if necessary. They will need to scavenge the
      destroyed city for resources, fight off rat vermin and make their way through
      the Capitol - all of this to finally get safely out of the city.<br><br>Similar
      to new XCOM games, there will be a combat layer and a strategy layer.<br><br>Turn-based
      tactical combat (which is present in the tech demo) makes use of cover and flanking
      mechanics. Due to the characters having to cope with stress and having their
      own quirks there is a fair chance that something will go wrong during the playthrough.
      Additionally, characters need to scavenge for resources during combat in order
      to survive.<br><br>The strategy layer will allow the player to plan their next
      missions, handle upgrades etc. Characters will be searching for their way out
      of the city, travelling from one safe point to another. They will have to gather
      resources in order to survive each day, heal themselves or upgrade their equipment.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Lead the group of Survivors in the search for sparse resources
      necessary to survive<br></li><li>Use cover and flanking mechanism to defeat
