Smokebox has once again exceeded all expectations. This locomotive and route are icons in American history and are by far some of the best DLC we have for this game. Fun and challenging to run. To have a piece of history so accurately recreated is simply stunning. This DLC and quite frankly, all Smokebox products are worth every penny. This is a locomotive that you want to read the manual with.\n\nPros:\nHighly Detailed\nLearning Curve (Not a Basic Locomotive)\nDetailed Route\nHistoric\nSounds Great\n\nCons:\nNone What So Ever\n\nThank you Smokebox for the time and effort you have put into your products.","timestamp_created":1569646098,"timestamp_updated":1569908708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57575756311416626","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqrr2wu0CfImA0wE="}
