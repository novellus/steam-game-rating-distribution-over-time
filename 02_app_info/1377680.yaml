    about_the_game: Crossfire II is an Retro / Arcade/ Top-Down Shooter, originally
      released in 2002 for Amiga and was our first commercial game. We still love
      it and decided to convert, update and release it on PC now. We hope, you also
      can still enjoy the game as we do.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1377680/extras/cf2_shop1.gif?t=1602680932"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN</h2><br>CFII offers three different
      game modes. The most important one is the story mode. In this story you play
      the role of Karsten, a young rebel pilot.<br>You have to play through a number
      of missions that couldn't be more manifold. Space battles alone or as part of
      a fleet, espionage and escort missions or hidden operations behind the enemy
      lines - no mission is like the other and even who's friend and who's the enemy
      is not always clear. Between and during the missions the story is told, important
      events are illustrated by short films.<br><br>The large number of different
      ships suits to this qualities. Fast fighters, heavy bombers and large capital
      ships with independent turrets atop battle each other in space or at the planet's
      surface. Somewhere inbetween transports try to get cover and stationary turrets
      defend important places. Here is where you can experience what it feels like
      being in a slow transport amidst a large battle. One time you will even drive
      a tank.<h2 class="bb_tag">MULTIPLAYER</h2><br>If you have some additional players
      at hand or if you just want to let the weapons speak unladen by a story and
      mission aims, the other two game modes of Crossfire II are for you. The survival
      mode offers entertaining battles to one to four players against hordes of computer
      controlled enemies.<br>Although teamwork is top priority here the one dealing
      most damage will win the round. This offers room for plenty of dirty tricks.
      Some friendships already broke on &quot;He shot the shield item right before
      my nose!&quot;<br><br>The third game mode is the classic dogfight mode. Two
      to four ships enter the arena and the last player alive is the winner.<br>An
      unbelievable range of weapons, items and hazards like gravitonic mines, asteroids,
      black holes and much more make sure the game won't get boring for many hours.
      In addition nearly any aspect of the gameplay of both modes can be configured.<br>The
      frequency and kind of items, the preferences for the weapon shop or the number
      and intelligence of the enemies - everythings adjustable. In Crossfire II nobody
      has to live with something he doesn't like.<h2 class="bb_tag">AMIGA REVIEWS</h2><br>AMIGA

    review: This game convinces with the smooth gameplay, the beautiful retro GFX
      and the (surprisingly) captivating story. It is not always easy to master each
      level but this makes it all the more exciting to play. I was also convinced
      by the atmospheric background music that invites to leave everyday life and
      enter an entirely different world. I enjoyed it more than I expected so far.
      Looking forward to continue playing. So far definitely a recommendation from
      my side!
