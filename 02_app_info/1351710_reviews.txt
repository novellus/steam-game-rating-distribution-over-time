The textures were a bit poor and unpolished so i tried the \"ultra\" settings and it was much better.\nEven though i had to turn it back down to \"high\" when i reached the prison because the game was lagging A LOT ! But it might come from my machine, maybe.\n\nThe controls and the combat feel slow and clunky, it took me some time to get used to it. I was actually about to rage quit when i encounter the Cyclop. And then i tried again, 2 more times and understood the mechanics and got him. So i thought \"ok, let's continue and see\"\n\nRight now i just killed the 3rd boss and i'm getting used to the gameplay and rythm of the whole thing.\n\nSo basically i thought it was hard to get into as i was expecting some Dark Souls like experience and in a way it is a bit like Dark Souls, with less polish of course as it's made by one guy only and not a whole team\n\nI want to say thank you for doing this, thank you for the effort and congrats for your work.\nIt's not perfect, it's note quite done yet but i'm enjoying this.\n\n\n\nI guess i'll send an email to the dev with some stuff that i noticed that could (i guess) easilly be fixed.\n\nEDIT : i just beat the game after 10 hours roughly and i have to say i really enjoy playing it until the end. I got more and more into it and i didn't care anymore about the unpolished aspect and other issues. \nI'll play NG+ now and try to get the last achievement i guess. Thanks for your work ! Keep on doing it !\n\n","timestamp_created":1605745563,"timestamp_updated":1605828764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlsy28fUCcp6brwI="}
