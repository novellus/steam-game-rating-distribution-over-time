The game gives you plenty of levels to understand the fundamentals of the game but I really enjoyed the endless mode, as it allows you to customize the amount of bots as well as the types of *beams?* that come at you. on the higher difficulties, with the 8 max bots, it really does become an intense exercise. You've really gotta challenge that inner Obi-wan Kenobi. As a lightsaber game, its on par with Beat Saber and modded Blade and Sorcery. Definitely worth a pick up.","timestamp_created":1605211633,"timestamp_updated":1605211633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532500028610229492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41raE3/UCfYX/rQI="}
