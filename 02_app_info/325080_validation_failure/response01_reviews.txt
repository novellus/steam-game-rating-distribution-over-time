Spend it on this pack. It turns this game into any other normal shooter where you can unlock everything through just simply playing the game. You can use your AC to focus on attachments, armor inserts, device inserts, grenades and even magnum ammo. Really balances out the game as your progress through the game and once you get out of the beginner queues, you won't be stuck with tier GI guns and GI armor. You'll actually be able to stand a chance.\n\nReally good move on Ubisoft's part and hopefully they provide more things like this that can revive this game even more.\n\nEDIT: Game is closing down in december. Do not buy.","timestamp_created":1421299354,"timestamp_updated":1479989532,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552689909934997559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1oKQy9gCct2vNQ=="}
