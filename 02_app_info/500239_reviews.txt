Read the manual people, or at the very least, read the reference material and the startup check list. This is actually a fun plane to start, its a really neat process.\n\nMake sure you lean your fuel above 10k if you have auto-mixture off. \n\nWatch those landing speeds. I did what I thought was a decent tactical/attack landing and Lt Iron first over here blew the tires. I'm sure the trainer was very impressed. \n\nCool plane, and like the name indicates, it'll mentor you.","timestamp_created":1577063958,"timestamp_updated":1577063958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw38iVmO8CcZGf5gE="}
