    about_the_game: 'America''s #1 reality show for heroes is back for another season!
      Harness your superpowers to steal the spotlight, win votes, and save your sister!<br><br>&quot;The
      Hero Project: Redemption Season&quot; is the first installment in a new series
      of interactive novels by Zachary Sergi set in the &quot;Heroes Rise&quot; universe.
      Your choices control the story. It''s entirely text-based--129,000 words, without
      graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your
      imagination.<br><br>In a contest where everyone has superpowers, your opponents
      can cause earthquakes and explosions, but you''re an average Ani-Powered who
      wakes up with different animal attributes every day. Will your hawk eyes or
      canine claws take you far enough in the competition to satisfy the only person
      who can help your sister? And what happens if winning isn''t enough?<br><br>As
      you advance, the decisions you make will transform viewers'' ideas of what it
      means to be a hero. Will you fight for your own goals, or make sacrifices for
      the good of society? Strive for what you believe is right by following the rules,
      or take down the whole system with more radical methods? Would you take wealth
      and fame over changing the world?<h2 class="bb_tag">Choose Wisely. It''s Redemption
      Season.</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Play as male, female, trans, or nonbinary;
      gay, straight, or bi.<br></li><li> Begin a new story in Millennia City, influenced
      by your actions in the &quot;Heroes Rise&quot; trilogy.<br></li><li> Play as
      a new hero, in a new season of The Hero Project!</li></ul>'
