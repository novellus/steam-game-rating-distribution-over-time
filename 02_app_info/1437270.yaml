    review: "Seems like the few people who have reviewed the game haven't had a chance\
      \ to spend a ton of time with it, so I thought I would chime in with a more\
      \ detailed review. It's gonna be all kinda jumbled cause I'm just gonna write\
      \ what I think and keep writing until I think I've covered everything. I was\
      \ hesitant to give the game a chance due to the low amount of reviews and the\
      \ one lengthily negative review. After watching the trailer, I really wanted\
      \ to see what it was all about and give it a chance. I'm glad I did! When I\
      \ found out the game was developed by one man over the course of a few months,\
      \ it blew my mind!  That's crazy, especially for a game with this much going\
      \ on in it! That's another reason I decided to write this review, this game\
      \ deserves more attention and love from people who I know will enjoy it. Anyways,\
      \ I approached the game with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. As\
      \ the negative reviewer states, the game doesn't really do anything revolutionary\
      \ in the mechanics department. Hell, most games don't nowadays. The mechanics\
      \ work well though and I very much enjoyed running around using my different\
      \ light sources to explore the very unique and diverse levels. Not to mention\
      \ the enemies in the game, which aren't anything crazy but they are satisfying\
      \ to kill and add more to the story than really present a major challenge. Although\
      \ I did die a few times and often found myself running for my life. Where the\
      \ game makes up for the lack of mechanics innovation, is in the rich story.\
      \ I think the negative reviewer is not the type that is into immersing themselves\
      \ in a world and was just trying to run through to \u201Cbeat\u201D the game.\
      \ I took a completely different approach. I let myself get lost in the story,\
      \ exploring every inch of the levels and I found myself taking a deep interest\
      \ in the details strewn about. Take the papers scattered around the world for\
      \ example. In most games I look these over and just keep going because they\
      \ are usually some boring writing that's not really relevant to anything and\
      \ doesn't add much to the game. With Pleiades, they are pivotal to the full\
      \ experience. I stopped to find and read as many as I could and it was always\
      \ something different. Sometimes it was just a nothing note, but it still added\
      \ to the richness of the world and explained something about it's strangeness.\
      \ Sometimes, I caught myself laughing out loud as I read the hilarious woes\
      \ of a notes author. Other times, I was highly intrigued by the science-fiction\
      \ accuracy to real world UFO research. This guy that made this game really knows\
      \ his UFO stuff and he made an excellent game and story that really entertained\
      \ me. Some of the papers hold information that is absolutely vital to moving\
      \ forward in the story via key codes or clues, etc, so I highly suggest reading\
      \ every note you find and enjoy piecing the story together like that. None of\
      \ the notes are really all that long and it never seemed like a chore to me\
      \ like some games make it. But if you don't like reading, or don't like that\
      \ type of story telling addition then this probably isn't the game for you.\
      \ Moving on, I think the voice acting is pretty damn good. Especially for a\
      \ game made by one man, on what I can only assume was a really low budget. The\
      \ main character Michael is actually voiced by the creator of the game and he\
      \ does a great job of bringing the story to life with a very unique and enjoyable\
      \ voice and character. Sometimes the acting is a little corny but given the\
      \ rest of the humor peppered throughout the game I really think that was on\
      \ purpose haha. The attention to detail given to every aspect of the game, story\
      \ and world makes me think everything was intentional. The other characters\
      \ don't play massive roles vocally but there is some quality content in there.\
      \ The overall writing of the dialog is great and moves the story along at a\
      \ nice pace. I don't want to give away any spoilers to the story but it is a\
      \ great story in my opinion. If you are fascinated with the UFO subject like\
      \ I am then I think you will really enjoy it. I really enjoyed the rest of the\
      \ sounds and audio in the game including the music. It was all very unique and\
      \ different to what I am used to. The footsteps on wood and some other surfaces\
      \ are a little corny and outdated but they aren't that prevalent throughout\
      \ the game. I think the guy who gave the game a scathing review kept saying\
      \ things like you walk here, do this, then walk there and do that or something\
      \ like that haha I'm pretty sure that's like every game ever haha Anyways about\
      \ that, I really enjoyed running around and exploring and walking through the\
      \ puzzle areas and taking the full story in while doing so. The puzzles aren't\
      \ anything mind blowing but they are certainly interesting and I found myself\
      \ having absolutely no clue what was going to happen next, which I very much\
      \ enjoyed. I kept thinking I knew exactly what was going to happen next and\
      \ I was almost always wrong. The game certainly has a few \u201Cscary\u201D\
      \ moments and an overall aura of mystery and fear but it isn't overly scary\
      \ and I wouldn't really call it a horror game. It's more of a mystery with hints\
      \ of horror. What else... the graphics are pretty damn good, a little dated\
      \ and certainly not AAA status but I enjoyed the art direction and a lot of\
      \ the world does really have a lot of detail. Not too often you see UFO's in\
      \ video games so seeing those parts of the game made me extra excited. The game\
      \ runs really well. To be fair I am playing with a GTX 1080 at 1440P so it's\
      \ probably a bit overkill for this game. The levels were really well laid out\
      \ and I found myself using the camera in the game to take quite a few pictures\
      \ of really beautiful shots. (Which save to your PC so you can share them!)\
      \ They aren't the biggest levels, some are bigger than others but there is a\
      \ happy medium. There is plenty of painkillers and light refueling items strewn\
      \ about to make it relatively easy to make it through the game and there are\
      \ no difficulty settings either. I've never been the guy that enjoyed games\
      \ that make it near impossible to beat, so I really enjoyed the easier approach\
      \ to survival and not having to sweat bullets or re-load all the time. Sometimes\
      \ I just want to experience a game, enjoy the story, have some challenges but\
      \ nothing over the top and Pleiades delivered on that experience. Cut-scenes\
      \ are at times breathtaking, sometimes hilarious and other times a little lackluster.\
      \ Overall they are great and the pacing of them is good. This isn't the longest\
      \ game. I took me about 5 hours to beat it and I was poking around exploring\
      \ a lot. I know I didn't catch everything though and I intend to go back and\
      \ give it an even more thorough play through in the future. (There was a secret\
      \ area I found but didn't have all the clues put together to access it.) I wish\
      \ the game was longer and there were more enemies and weapons and all that.\
      \ BUT I did enjoy having a more limited experience for once with a game. Where\
      \ it's not all about getting new weapons to kill the enemy in a slightly different\
      \ way. The game focuses on the story and gives you a handful of mechanics that\
      \ aren't extraordinary but do the job and fit well. Well, I hope this answered\
      \ some of your burning questions if you were on the fence about getting the\
      \ game. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it if you are intrigued by\
      \ the UFO topic, enjoy exploring and reading, like to game but aren't in dire\
      \ need of a massive challenge and you'd rather just experience the story. The\
      \ ending is EPIC!"
