    about_the_game: 'Here it is! All the pleasure of Psychonauts music gathered here
      for you to enjoy, without all that tedious running, jumping , and otherwise
      playing of the game. Peter McConnell has put together a fantastic score for
      you to enjoy. Every track here is so different, and yet they have so many sneaky
      things in common. There are themes sewn throughout each piece so subtly, you
      could listen to it a hundred times before you''d catch them all. And that''s
      what I recommend you do: listen to the soundtrack one hundred times. In a row.
      And whenever the action music from Sasha''s cube comes on, chase your cat around
      the house the whole time. And when Bonita''s theme comes on, sit down and cry
      for no reason. And when the Meat Circus music plays, cry for no reason AND chase
      your cat at the same time. That will really freak her out.'

    review: 'Make sure you look at the track listing before you buy!!! Apparently,
      the official soundtrack doesn''t have my favorite song (Agent Cruller''s Sacred
      Hall) so make sure you know what you''re getting!!!


      Edit: Apparently, Agent Cruller''s Sacred Hall is a secret song found at the
      end of the credits theme. Now I love this purchase!'
