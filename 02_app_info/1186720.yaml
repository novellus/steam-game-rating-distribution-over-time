    review: Get ready for a fun, challenging, well done jrpg (took me over 30 hours
      to complete). Be patient in the beginning (as just like a great book the first
      few chapters set the storyline then delivers bigtime).  Many areas to explore
      and later on in game you can return to them to pick up additional goodies from
      the same treasures chests. Has no quest menu so just make a mental note on where
      to go.  The quests are well done and give high powered weapons and items.  Explore
      everywhere and battles are challenging and quick. And one of the best things
      is that the developer is quick to respond and help and fix any bugs. Just wish
      more developers were this fast to respond with many other rpgs. A definite jrpg
      winner!
