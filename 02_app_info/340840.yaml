    review: 'Really good horror puzzler.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.

      It builds up and maintains a real creepy atmosphere in a depressing dystopian
      world which I just absolutely loved.  You make your way from memory to memory,
      accessing crime scenes, solving puzzles and trying to figure out what has happened.  The
      story is markedly cryptic but it gives you just enough to keep you intrigued,
      and there''s at least some amount of an effort to tie things off in a neat enough
      ending.  Some of the puzzles did veer into pixel hunt territory, but nothing
      unforgiveable (especially as there is always youtube) and it must be said the
      English translation was definitely a bit ropey at times, though certainly not
      the worst I''ve seen in horror games on steam.

      Some mechanics, though they fitted thematically, I don''t think they quite worked
      out mechanically given the genre.  There''s a cohesion/sanity meter which you
      must keep up to stay alive, and it slowly is eaten away over time as you exist
      in this putrid world.  And while that was great at first as it really put the
      pressure on to move quickly, I found that after I died a few times it was very
      easy to speed your way back through a level hovering up all the cohesion-restoring
      potions whilst expending barely any.  And after a while I ended up with a ridiculous
      amount of potions that I never needed to worry about taking my time.  Having
      a limited number of potions that was reset in each memory likely would have
      worked better.

      Also I really didn''t like the save mechanic.  You could deploy an ''anchor''
      which saves your game but if you wanted to save again you had to go and pick
      it up and deploy it again.  Again I think checkpointing would have made more
      sense.


      But with those nitpicks aside it''s definitely a good game that just hasn''t
      got the visibility it deserves.  I loved the creepy doll design.  And the game
      did a wonderful job of NOT bombarding me with jumpscares accompanied with the
      soundtrack screaming in my ear, as steam horror games tend to do.  Instead the
      game just let the player engage with the setting and horrors naturally.  And
      I definitely did jump more than once, like when I was busy rummaging round through
      the drawers of a room when I noticed I''m silently being watching by an unspeakable
      horror in the corner of the room.  Chilling stuff, the game really does a great
      job of getting under your skin.

      And though there were bugs, the developer must be applauded for how they''re
      still working away at this over 2 years post launch.  I encountered a game breaking
      bug and the developer had it resolved and a new patch out straightaway.  It
      clearly is a labor of love this game for the developer and I recommend you pick
      it up and support them and hopefully they''re put out more quality games in
      the future.'
