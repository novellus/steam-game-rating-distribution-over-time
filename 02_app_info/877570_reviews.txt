It is  a wonderful behind the scenes look at the very founders of the  home computing and technological  revolution that  changed the world  from 1970 to 1990... an still today.\nWhat is still AMAZING about  C>64,  Amiga, and the  Atari  400/800/800XL/ST   computers = is  YOU.   YOU  create the software,  you become a full programmer - from  machine code, assembly,  BASIC,  etc.    8 bit computing is at a  level  most  human brains  easily relate to and understand.   16 bit computing  takes your code to the next level,  and developer tools help you write and create.   Once you move on to the new   smart phone and  windows platforms of today - now you need a team of  engineers to write a new product...\nBut back in 1980s -  a  few guys could  put a game together,  or a business program,   they could make up the boxes and make copies of the disks and label them  and  sell them by  mail -   advertised  in computing magazines,  long before the internet...   These are not only the Golden Age of computing -  they are obtainable to anyone wanting to become creative... and the  newest version of the CPUs  are used in thousands of products today -  low cost,  industrial strength and durable,  the computing power of  the 1980s   is even cheaper now,  and running countless systems, devices, and applications with  room to spare...  embedded code with 64K of  RAM,  and not even using all that memory -  orders of  magnitude  more cost  effective than the  Gigabytes used to keep bloatware running.     Tiny tight 8-bit code is  near bullet proof,  very  dependable.   Thank you for a wonderful   double product  !  :-)","timestamp_created":1595986551,"timestamp_updated":1595986551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jcSNzPMCftuUmAI="}
