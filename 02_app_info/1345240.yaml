    about_the_game: "Shuffs is a physics-based puzzle game which makes use of platforming\
      \ controls as a means of hurling projectiles wherever a projectile may need\
      \ hurling. It's essentially mini-golf, but the kind of mini-golf where you can\
      \ hit the ball straight into the air, jump up after it and whack it mid-air\
      \ into the face of a fire-spitting demon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a game\
      \ for those who don't feel as though they've earned their victory if said victory\
      \ was obtained without experiencing the inclination to scream at their computer\
      \ at least once. The simple core mechanic (walk up to round object, hit round\
      \ object) is expanded on and diversified over 38 levels, seeing you catapult\
      \ boulders with crocodile jaws, ride on the webs of spiders as you propel them\
      \ through the air, or just kick back and play a little keep-up with a balloon\
      \ in one of the 24 bonus levels you can unlock if you're a good little scarecrow\
      \ who works their way through the 36 funky stunt shots scattered throughout\
      \ the farms, swamps and industrial district of Bowkin County.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe story takes about 2 - 3 hours to complete, and up to an additional 2 hours\
      \ to achieve the true ending."

    review: 'while i don''t feel comfortable giving this game a thumbs up, its not
      exactly a thumbs down, regardless i wouldn''t spend more than 2$-3$ dollars
      on it, 5$ is a little too much to ask i think.
