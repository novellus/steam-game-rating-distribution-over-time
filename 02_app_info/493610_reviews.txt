It boosts you with some stuff.. instead of farming for hours for every guardian you get them all, saves you time with inventory management with 200 slots, gives you like ~16000~ trek coins and it makes you look cool. The reason this is 45$ is because changing data on the server permanently costs like how big your inventory is, don't be mad at the creators for this its for keeping them alive they are hardworking devs and are working hard on the phase 2\n\nEdit: scummy devs, dead game, update is taking really slow","timestamp_created":1563576135,"timestamp_updated":1594518566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5727577805519104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx86toPMCdIDazgE="}
