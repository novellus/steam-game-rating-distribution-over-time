Please before you will write this bad review then try find some information about developing and exactly developing in Unreal Engine and with Unreal asset. I bought very much assets from Marketplace and very much assets from Synty store, as one seat license. And I can use all this assets in my commercial project. This is how assets work. You can buy asset, you can make game, you sell game. Everyone who buy this can use it. And btw all assets from Synty store are only source files for your project. You cant compile alone asset to game. If you want make game from asset you need make or buy game system and you must have very very much free time for edit/include it to your game. I hope that now you understand how work it. THX"}],"cursor":"AoJwrciT9vQCd6bCpQI="}
