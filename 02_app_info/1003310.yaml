    review: 'Overall good DLC. Overgrowth map and idea of unlocking plots by doing
      challenges was great, first map looked cool, third one isn''t bad either. I
      think this is the point from where they started adding wave based maps/challenges
      into the game, and they overshoot it a little bit here. It took me 20 in-game
      years to get 3 stars on last map, 30 total to get the achievement. The ice statue
      is great object to place in all those warm maps.

      The new curing rooms look neat.'
