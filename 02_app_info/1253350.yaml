    review: If u an Kiss fan or listen to Hardrock than its worth. the devils rocker
      is really good cause he can damage all enemys with one attack, doesnt matter
      where there are standing. its fun to play with him. but pls have in mind u need
      at least an style skill of 7 or 8! and its hard to achieve this in the beginning
      without cheating :( so if u will play a game + ok but i think u could enable
      the class to late in the game so u wont have enough time and or fun with it.
