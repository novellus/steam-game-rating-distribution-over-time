Not a relaxed hidden object game (which I love and have bought dozens) but everything is on a timer.  After getting past the clunky navigation system, I was finally on a screen with something to do.  One of the items I had to find was a comb, I could not find it at all, pressing hint revealed a hair brush!? It is this lack of attention to detail and clunky navigation which is making me uninstall the game.  Even though I purchased it on a sale, I fell ripped off by the very low price I paid.","timestamp_created":1569174749,"timestamp_updated":1569174749,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49M+Gre0CdMHa0gE="}
