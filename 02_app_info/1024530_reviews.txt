For FREE. If you want a pixel art game that will last you, plus not cost you a dime- then this is the best there is. This games does seem to be abandoned (the developer never says anything and no posts or updates, but again-225 hours of content is more than you can reasonably hope for even from an active pixel art game where updates or DLC for cost are offered).  If you pass this up then it is fully your loss in every sense.","timestamp_created":1599279809,"timestamp_updated":1599279809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556247591972351074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nqigrvQCdN7vnwI="}
