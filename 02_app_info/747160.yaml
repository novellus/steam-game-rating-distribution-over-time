    review: "[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[b]Nicely written story, but to me it feels like\
      \ the ending is cut off. Without me trying to give away spoilers, I think the\
      \ ending has a lot more potential.[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros/Cons[/h1]\n\n[b]+ Well written\n\
      + Nice sound\n\n+/- \u2018Okay\u2019 visuals (suitable to ambiance), and I did\
      \ like the animated design of the personas a lot (including the \u2018eyes\u2019\
      \ and \u2018sun/light\u2019 signs \u2013 I think I fully understand their meaning),\
      \ and the mansion. However I did not like the images of the church and road,\
      \ that look too much like regular photos made black-white, and also didn\u2019\
      t really blend in with the story.\n+/- Short, but I knew that before I got the\
      \ game. The length of this visual novel is fair to its price.\n\n- Story is\
      \ cut of at the end[/b]"
