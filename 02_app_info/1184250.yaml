      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Catch?</strong></h2>The player can relate\
      \ to the content if she/he has been through the Finnish Army. Strong language,\
      \ black humor, strict guidelines, repetitive tasks, simple core mechanics are\
      \ the heart of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Education?</strong></h2>Ever\
      \ wondered what your pals experienced during their time in the army? You were\
      \ in a different platoon and didn\u2019t have a chance to participate in the\
      \ same training? Now you can choose your own educational branch and see what\
      \ it\u2019s been like!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Mechanics?</strong></h2>Remember\
      \ those good old \u201Ctrack and field\u201D type of games? How about \u201C\
      Tony Hawk\u201D games? This game will feature a lot of mechanics that many will\
      \ remember from their childhood. Furthermore, RPG elements like dialogues, inventory,\
      \ player stats, free roaming, skill trees etc. will provide additional depth\
      \ to the gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Story?</strong></h2>The game\
      \ will have a \u201Cmeta plot\u201D. The player will be able to reveal army\
      \ secrets that shouldn\u2019t be commonly known. The player also maintains connection\
      \ to the outside world by watching TV news and participating in activities during\
      \ the weekend holidays which both will affect the gameplay.<br><br><br><img\
