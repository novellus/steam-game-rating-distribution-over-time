Unfortunately it seems to be a dead game.\n\nWas actually impressed. I expected a crappy little space shooter with low quality graphics, and it was the total opposite.\nFor a free game, there is impressive graphics, sound, and the gameplay was solid.\nSmooth flying, and accurate shooting mechanics, make for a great little package.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out, if only to see what it could have been.\nBut like I said, sadly seems to be a dead game.\n\nDon't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Nq28y6H_M&index=46&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8","timestamp_created":1487822195,"timestamp_updated":1487822195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629143297672271729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k6HHtNoCdJPvcg=="}
