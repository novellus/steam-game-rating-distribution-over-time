It just feels so off. its not a good feeling. It just does not feel tight and snappy and responsive.\n\nI would like to continue but man, i just cant.\n\nThe weird feeling of the controls just kills it for me.\n\nI like the game and, im all more super meat boy games /shrug","timestamp_created":1599550976,"timestamp_updated":1599551047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482166439294815063","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41YCrtvQCcMPDoAI="}
