    review: 'Definitely has potential to be a good game, but limited features and
      buggy achievements really hold it back to me.

      I''ll start with the pros:

      *Some challenges are actually hard to beat

      *Fun simple mechanic that most people play cooking simulators for

      *Has multiplayer


      The cons however:

      *Very repetitive with only burger, hotdog, fries

      *The challenges they do have are just a random shuffle of serving certain people
      certain things, adding to the repetitive aspect

      *Certain levels are impossible to get past 1 star in.  I practiced on one level
      out of pure determination wanting to 100% the game, and managed to get second
      place on the leaderboards for the level, and got 1 star.'
