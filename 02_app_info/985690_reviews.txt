It’s been a while since I’ve read something so bad that it actually flips over to being amazing, but My Billionaire Boss has done it for me. Granted, the writing is juvenile and riddled with typos and grammatical errors, and the characters all act like they’re in middle school, but its immaturity is part of what makes it so dang entertaining to read.  This is clearly a teenage girl’s fan fiction of what it would be like to date a super hot billionaire executive; it's wildly inaccurate as to what actual corporate life is like, but also really funny in a way only a teenage imagination can be. So much of what happens in the story is ridiculously silly and illogical, especially when it comes to its totally cliché and melodramatic relationship drama, but I haven’t laughed so hard while reading something in YEARS, and I honestly need more like it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813768130\nThe premise itself is ridiculously dumb. You’re the executive assistant to the CEO of a multi-billion dollar design firm. Through a string of contrivances, you end up dating your boss’s super hot brother, which is when your boss realizes that despite working for him for 3 years, he needs to get into your pants RIGHT NOW! Depending on your choices, you can either spend the rest of the game cheating on your boyfriend with your boss (which is honestly the only way to go), or try beating him off of you with a stick. Cheating and grab-assing aside, everything else about the story is so outrageously unrealistic that it’s endearing. In order to drive home just how rich these characters are, the writer continually tries one-upping their displays of power and wealth with a ridiculous amount of name-dropping. And when they’re not measuring  dicks over who’s higher on Forbes’ Top 10 List, they’re bragging about how incredibly handsome they are.  \n\nBut with as bad as the writing is, the artwork is actually really freaking good for a Wattpad-novel-turned-otome-game. Almost every single character with dialogue has a sprite, and they’re all really detailed and attractively drawn.  As for the CGs, they’re fantastic! It’s too bad that the writing accompanying them is too silly to be taken seriously, because this game has some of the best kiss CGs I’ve seen in a while. Unfortunately, kissing is about as much as you’re going to get out of this story, however. While there’s a lot of teasing and back and forth between the characters, the writing itself is pretty chaste. Sure, there are a few desperately steamy encounters, but if you’re expecting much more than some vampire-like neck sucking, you’ll be fairly disappointed.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1812869419\nThat said, I do recommend My Billionaire Boss, but with the HUGE stinking caveat that you not take it seriously as an otome game, because you WILL be disappointed if you do. But if you can shut off the part of your brain that questions every stupid thing that happens in the story and just enjoy the ride, you’re sure to find this insanely silly take on dating a billionaire to be entertaining as all heck!\n\n[code][h1]Curated by: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32217440-Bad-Otome-Games/]Bad Otome Games[/url] & [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33004802-Chudah%27s-Corner/]Chudah's Corner[/url][/h1][/code]","timestamp_created":1564118008,"timestamp_updated":1564235704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":52,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.814684152603149414","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7NTtmewCcfiQzwE="}
