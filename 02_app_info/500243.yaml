    review: 'I would love to give this a good rating, and I would, if I could haul
      trains. I got this engine for by b-day back in apirl, when I didn''t know there
      was a "pro range." More recently, I found out about the manuel. Half an Hour
      later I got the engine to work. But when I try to load a train (It works light
      engine) it says, "Error: Error occurred while loading this QuickDrive." If someone
      knows how to fix this, please let me know.'
