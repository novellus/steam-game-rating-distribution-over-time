It's all fun, it's all good, get this pack*! I love variety. Now time to go play that Nazareth tune again!\n\n*Arch Enemy - Nemesis requires tuning in C standard for both guitar and bass (like Dethklok). You might not be able to play it comfortably on your normal guitar you use for E Standard tuning. I suggest taking an old guitar/bass (I took my first bass) and put some heavy gage strings on it and use it for lower tunings, like D and below.\n\n*Presidents of the USA - Peaches is in Eb Drop Db, just to give a heads up. I must say I wasn't expecting it from them.","timestamp_created":1463161193,"timestamp_updated":1463161193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588631272315979004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ooDN1dQCfrjKVw=="}
