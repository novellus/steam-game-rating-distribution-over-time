    review: 'This is one of the Realistic coasters released for Epic Roller Coasters.
      It''s probably the most realistic of the 4 DLC coasters.


      The atmosphere is nice and the coaster has some nice turns and takes you down
      to near the water and high up into the air.


      One thing I did notice it that this one more than others shows up the aliasing
      jaggy lines. There really could do with being an anti-aliasing option to smooth
      out the pixelisation.


      I would have liked a few ''events'' in this, I know they are trying to do realistic
      but there must be things that could be added to spice it up, like animals in
      the woods or something.


      Still going to recommend but only just, in the hope that we see more improvements,
      but I''d say get this maybe only if you are buying them all in a bundle.'
