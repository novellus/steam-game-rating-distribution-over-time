I actually paid $3.74 USD back in the Steam Spring Sale 2018 and it originally retailed for $14.99 USD, which is difficult for me to believe because this game is not good at all. In fact, the more that I played this game, the more that I grew to dislike this game. After one hour, I don't ever want to play this game and I'm going to uninstall it.\n\nIt's not the worst game. So you may want to check it out regardless if you have time to waste. However, I should warn you that this  game is subpar as far as racket games in VR go. I would recommend Racket NX or Holoball over this effort, even though they are not free to play.\n\nThe physics on this is just not realistic or satisfying. The rackets almost feel like they bend when you swing them to hit the ball as if they are made out of papier-mâché. It just feels clunky and weird playing this game. There are several mini-games to play, but most of them feel like exactly the same game. In any event, I didn't find any of them fun. Also, most of the action happens behind you (at least on the Oculus Rift).\n\nThere is also a voiced-narrator in this game that tells what seems like a joke a minute. However, most of the jokes just fall flat. And several lines are repeated. After an hour, you'll probably want to strangle the narrator.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. On one hand, I feel sorry for the devs because they obviously made this game free to play because not many people bought it and thus didn't make enough of a return on their investment of time and labor. On the other hand, it's kind of crappy that they didn't keep their promises on updating this game.[/b]","timestamp_created":1568392987,"timestamp_updated":1568392987,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567774474620819092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4l7jgle0Ce4CV0gE="}
