It was one of my favourite games back then. Im glad to see it back again. \n\nIt stays close to the feel and atmosphere of the original and is graphically better. I love the additional combat moves.\n\nI do wish it was longer, however.\n\nIf you liked the old version, pick it up, if not only for the nostalgia.","timestamp_created":1567878714,"timestamp_updated":1567878714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqdK2hu0Cc73q0QE="}
