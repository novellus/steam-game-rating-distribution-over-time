      to mention that we are no longer in early access at this time. However we are
      planning another patch that will include some bug fixes and achievements.

    review: Rogues like us is a fun roguelite game with simple but ok artwork , i
      had some probs with a bug in the tutorial but the devs immidiately helped me
      and i solved it! after that the game seems to play ok without major bugs (while
      im writing it the game is in early access so some minor bugs are expected)..The
      music of the game is kinda not fitting at all, its a total relaxing music while
      you fight lol :P but i guess they ll add something else later and keep this
      music only in the menu:P  I was waiting long to play this game it looks pretty
      nice and its a good buy for its price especially if you find it on sales.. Its
      a YES for me ...
