    review: "not bad, that little program is actually not bad, it has some problems\
      \ that i hope get fixed (PLEASE PUT THE NAMES OF DRIVES, FOLDERS AND FILES DIRECTLY\
      \ UNDER THE FILE OR AT LEAST A SHORTENED VERSION, instead of the hard to find\
      \ name in the bottom line there, also a button to switch hands would come in\
      \ handy ) but all in all quite ok. \n\nit looks but it does what it is supposed\
      \ to do and has a music player in it as well, allthough it is kinda hard to\
      \ figure out how it works (it is a button on the lower left just labeled \"\
      play\" and it functions like a regular play pause button for the peviously selected\
      \ music file. \n\nI really love the look of the menu, plain and simple to use\
      \ it with a really nostalgic look. there is still some room for improovement\
      \ tho (as stated above, you almost can't tell where you are and small hints\
      \ to the names of the folders would make it a lot easier)\n\nuser tipp: if you\
      \ want to easily find the photos you got put them on a usb stick bevore entering\
      \ vr, so you dont have to go through every drive and folder to find them. also\
      \ you can push left or right on the touchpad to switch between the photos you\
      \ got in that folder.\n\nim not exactly sure if it is worth the price but well,\
      \ everyone got to live from something, if you are looking for a basic 360 photo\
      \ viewer for vive, here you got a good one, mayby not fancy, but classy"
