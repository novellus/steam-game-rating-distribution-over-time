Also the guy outside the gym says to go north. I beat some team rocket knockoffs, and find the north exit in both that town and the the previous town blocked off. \n\nAbsolute garbage. Even the review below me flat out saying this is the best game ever could only bear to play it for an hour and a bit. And I have a strong suspicion the review below is a shill account\n\nLike if he truly thought he had found the greatest game ever, why would he only play it for an hour and a bit after a full month?","timestamp_created":1580574091,"timestamp_updated":1580842394,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmZTjiPACe8XJ7wE="}
