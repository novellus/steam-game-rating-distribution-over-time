It was hard written into the narrative and there were some light to moderate consequences to the story if you didn't win. So it wasn't like you could ignore it and just auto lose to get it over with. \n- The voice actor is only super annoying when she's trying to be cheery. When she was actually serious or angry, I kinda liked it. \n- The art didn't stop being inconsistent, but I guess my eyes got used to it. Steampunk american for the PC and French with wigs for the nobility why not? :P\n\nAdditionally, I would have to say a HUGE flaw of this episodic game where I got the implication you carve your story out slowly is that the continuity is terrible. Epi 0, there was no romance but none of the decisions I made in epi 0 mattered. I assume a cannon was chosen for the 0.5 little story they wrote to bridge the gap to episode 1. The character is hard written to be an ethical slut, and I use the term correctly not pejoratively So the romances, even if they seemed to be going somewhere, are hardwired to end in some way. I romanced -person A- in episode 1, and in episode 2 I never saw person A or heard of them again, even if you chose the events that would literally have kept them in town/ The game does ask you about the decisions you made in episode 1, but they don't seem to have much affect. Four main characters that are both in epi 1 and 2 treat PC the same regardless of whether I said I slutted it up, didn't slut it up, argued with them all the time, got along with them fine, or trusted/distrusted them. And even in an ending where I tried to start a relationship with -Person B- we break it off. And what I thought was a cool default poly option with person C that occurred because you weren't with anyone romantically, it happens every time no matter what. so... what does that even say about my romantic choices, if PC is cannon open to a threeway with person C and person D?\n\nA visual novel should also just have a \"skip to unseen text\" option every time. Between having to manually skip AND play the mini game, I am unsure of how much of the 23.5 hours spent on this game according to steam was actually enjoying the story vs pressing shift, loading screens, and a turn based mini game that sometimes lagged. \n\nThis has a strong but flawed female protaganist is absolutely their own character and personality with a lot of auto default dialogue. I found the story very absorbing the first round through. I recommend playing this game exactly twice. Maybe a 3rd time, after a long break, to prepare you for the episode 4 that hopefully will come out.","timestamp_created":1607785103,"timestamp_updated":1607785103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46bfdq/YCc6XBuQI="}
