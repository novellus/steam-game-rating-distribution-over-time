    short_description: Colossals tells the story of a vagrant, who, together with
      his love interest, the soon-to-be-Empress Khalida, interpret the fairy tales
      they read in front of a windmill to be fact, telling them of a faraway land
      where, once upon a time, giants roamed.

    review: "Perhaps it is because I haven't played many novels yet, but this is just\
      \ a collections of mostly seen maps with uncountable collectibles. \nThe story\
      \ and sometimes even the layout of the maps doesn't make sence most of the time.\n\
      There is no love to the story or the characters. \nReading the huge text passages\
      \ is boring, some parts repeat, too.\n\nNegative:\n[list][*]You cannot change\
      \ from Fullscreen to Window mode or change between programms. You have to save\
      \ and close each time you want to do something (like writing a guide, saving\
      \ screenshots)\n[*]You can only run when holding the shift key, but the maps\
      \ are huge. \n[*]You can only collect 99 of the same collectibles, all more\
      \ vanish.\n[*]Even the trading is boring.[/list]\n\nJust finished Book 1."
