    review: 'At least as of March 5, 2020 this soundtrack will not automatically show
      up in you steam library soundtracks list. You will need to search for it on
      your hard drive. To save you some heartache here''s the (default) location in
      program files (x86):


      Steam > SteamApps > common > Iratus Lord of the Dead > bonus content > Soundtrack


      Enjoy!'
