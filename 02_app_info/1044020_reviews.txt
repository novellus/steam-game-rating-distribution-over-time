Beat it in roughly 5.2 hours using a controller.  Difficulty is Medium, with some of the puzzles and running challenges being tricky.  Cute game to play; great for kids.  You can even beat the game without hurting anything (If you're savvy enough). \n\n- Graphics are great.  Everything from the different levels to the homes to the character art all has a unique charm to it.\n\n- There's a small amount of music, but the soundtrack has a nice Celtic folklore vibe that fits with everything.  Wish there was an OST available, because this'd be great music for studying to. \n\n- Characters are funny, whimsical, and cute.  So is their dialogue.  Well, mostly...  People can be a bit of a jerk to Potata, but I like how she overcomes bullies and saves the day.\n\n- Speaking of dialogue, when I first started Potata, the menu was in Russian.  Switching to English was easy enough, but it threw me off.  Some of the English translations in the game are passable.\n\n- There's a fox!  Squeak! Snort!\n\n- The gameplay is great.  That's why you get this.  Jumping around avoiding deadly cockelburs and finding items to thwart bitey plants while save points seem tauntingly far away will seem hard at first, but once you get use to it the game is pretty awesome.  The puzzles are also really fun to figure out.  The idea of a quest list keeps Potata from being linear.  \n\n\n\nIn summary, Potata: Fairy Flower is a charming, short platformer with plenty to do, a nice variety of puzzles to solve, and a weekend of fun to be had.  The price is right, and it's unique enough to stand out on its own in any gamer collection.  Potata is witch that perseveres through bullies and naysayers and finds her own way to tackle challenges and get through life.","timestamp_created":1607896465,"timestamp_updated":1607896837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uNWHr/YCfdn6uQI="}
