    review: '[h1]Short review[/h1]


      In addition of being a microtransaction, this DLC is probably the worst map
      of the Cradle of Civilization Map Pack. The map lacks the details of the others.
      You can find the same map on the Steam Workshop with better details and for
      free.


      [h1]Long review[/h1]


      This DLC allows you to play on a map of the Americas. A map only available in
      Small size. Absolutely. [i]Small[/i]. The Americas. Evidently, it lacks the
      details the other maps of the Cradle of Civilization Pack could be proud of.
      Furthermore, paying for such a feature is a shame in my opinion. You can pretty
      much find the same using the Steam Workshop. If you really want this DLC, get
      it in a bundle or with the Complete Edition of Civilization V.'
