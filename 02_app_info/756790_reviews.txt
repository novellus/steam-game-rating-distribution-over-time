Your goal is to light all the magic runes on the level by moving over them, but if an enemy steps on one it will extinguish and you have to light it again.\n\nThe game is entirely confined to little 5x5 grid levels. I was skeptical at first. What kind of level design can you do on 25 tiles? As it turns out, quite a lot. The game mixes its few different enemy types plus environmental tiles (walls, teleports, death tiles) into quite a variety of levels, each of which puts a clearly formulated challenge to the player. \n\nLevels can be simply cleared or beaten in the minimum number of moves. Doing the former isn't too difficult until later in the game, but the latter really brings out the surprising amount of complexity in the mechanics. If you're looking for a challenge, this is it. Most levels can be cleared in around ten moves. It doesn't feel like that should be too difficult but some levels made me give up after exhausting all the ideas I could come up with (damn those cats). Of the levels where I did find the solution I can say that you often need a flash of insight revealing an unlikely move as a different, more effective strategy to beat a level.\n\nWhat I want from a puzzle game is, a non-derivative set of simple mechanics that fit well together, tight and varied level design, and a bit of challenge. This game takes a place in my short list of games on steam that fit the bill.","timestamp_created":1530405686,"timestamp_updated":1576834679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642528414726257324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jfiqke8CftfmpAE="}
