    about_the_game: Welcome to a grim dystopian future.<br>A totalitarian State controls
      every aspect of private and public life.<br>Laws are oppressive. Surveillance
      is total. Privacy is dead.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/475550/extras/ButFreedomlives.png?t=1608659964"

      /><br><br>You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building. Your
      daily routine involves making the building a sweet spot for tenants, who will
      come and go. However, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission...<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop
      on their conversations. You must BUG their apartments while they're away, SEARCH
      their belongings for whatever can threaten the authority of the State, and PROFILE
      them for your superiors. You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the
      laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>You are a cog in a totalitarian machine with your own family who also
      has needs. Do you cling to your humanity and cover up your tenants? Or do you
      survive by staying loyal to the regime? The choice is yours.<br><br>You can
      report the suspicious activities of a father but orphan his children. Or you
      can withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance
      to make things right? Or you can blackmail him to earn something your family.<br><br><img
