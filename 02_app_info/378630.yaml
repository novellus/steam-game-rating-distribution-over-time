    about_the_game: When Silvia is hunted by the person behind the attempted murder
      she was assigned to commit, she knows the only option remaining is to face the
      deadly conspirator openly. In the heart of the local underworld, Silvia will
      discover a game of power in which everyone is an expendable pawn. A forced alliance
      with her ex-target seems to be the only way to avoid the inevitable, but if
      they want to dispel the secretive mists of the Vatican, James and Silvia will
      have to come to terms with their limitations...

    review: 'Loved this game. Same review for both Acts, being them part of a unique
      game.

      Good investigation context, nothing to make you lose you mind though. The Vatican
      and surroundings are for sure a captivating scenario as well.

      Localized italian dialogues made it even funnier to go through the story.'
