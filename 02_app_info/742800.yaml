    review: "It seems that 360 videos are not working on Vive Pro from within the\
      \ VR menus. Never had a problem before, but now they start to launch, then go\
      \ right back to \"Launch in VR\", as if nothing has happened. Now occurs with\
      \ all 360 videos. \nFortunately, I've found, that if you shut down VR, then\
      \ launch a 360 video from the desktop without VR running, it will start the\
      \ VR and work normally.\nI like it. It's really short, but I like the lighting\
      \ effects, colorful and cool.\n\nP.S. - 360 VR videos will not work off-line.\
      \ When I try to launch one off-line it says \"Playback of a 360 video requires\
      \ installation of the Steam 360 video player\", so I go into tools and there\
      \ it is, installed. So I start the 360 video player and it says \"To watch a\
      \ 360 video, find the video in your steam video library and click watch\". So\
      \ I do that and it says  \"Playback of a 360 video requires installation of\
      \ the Steam 360 video player\". Catch 22 nightmare. They work when on-line,\
      \ so they should also work off-line. I will buy 360 videos again when it all\
      \ functions properly off-line, but will not purchase anymore till that happens."
