    about_the_game: 'Take command of your ship and crew as you explore space, planets,
      caves, shipwrecks, temples, and other dangerous locations. Find, buy, and sell
      commodities, equipment, and mysterious artifacts. Defend yourself against aggressive
      space pirates and hungry planetary denizens. Complete quests for profit, or
      to change the very power structure of the galaxy!<h2 class="bb_tag">And the
      universe is infinite...</h2>There is no limit to the number of sectors and planets
