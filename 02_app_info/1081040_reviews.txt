There's some gimmes like, say, an answering machine in the Twin Peaks Sheriff Department, where you might expect some fun Peaks-esque dialogue stuck in there. But, as memory serves, it's just an immediate clue for how to leave the scene as quickly as possible. \n\nIf you're a die hard Peaks fan, get it on sale and mess with it for an hour or two. But, put expectations to the floor. \n\nFor anyone else, desperately avoid as it's not a good enough experience on it's own.","timestamp_created":1609109635,"timestamp_updated":1609109635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+4+a0/YCe8D0vQI="}
