Both aspects are on-point, especially for a one man team.  \n\nCombat is tough.  Waves increase until you die, but bosses drop loot which can be carried over into future runs.\n\nFun, addictive, and possibly the greatest steal on Steam.","timestamp_created":1609580000,"timestamp_updated":1609580000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521531105041503906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsLac4fYCdIrWvwI="}
