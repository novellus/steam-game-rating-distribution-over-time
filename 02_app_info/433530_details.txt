Our Steam Card was fully updated. From now on there there is only one edition of the game called ‘Enhanced Edition’. This edition not only contains the base game but also all the DLCs that were released until now (over a dozen!) in the price of the regular game. We want everybody to experience the game in its entirety.<br><br>IMPORTANT: As we promised to our community, all who have bought the game prior to this change, get the FREE UPDATE TO ENHANCED EDITION! So, even if you own just the basic version of the game with no DLCs installed, you will still get access to both the Enhanced Edition of the game and ALL DLCs released until now! Enjoy!<br><br>ABOUT HELIBORNE: ENHANCED EDITION<br><br>Enhanced Edition is the next big step for the franchise. It will be a brand new visual quality mixed with significant gameplay overhaul. Klabater now develops Enhanced Edition and will release it on August 20, 2020, fully re-mastered, taking into account the expectations of the community!<br><br>With Heliborne: Enhanced Edition the Ultimate Helicopter Warfare Experience is now taken to new heights! <br><br>New Prototype Machines <br>Fully Upgraded Game Engine <br>New Day &amp; Night Maps <br>Updated in-game Physics <br>Empowered Multiplayer Experience <br>Refreshed User Interface<br><br>Enhanced Edition is meant as a final version of the Heliborne game dedicated to those who love the game already but also for newcomers. But this is definitely not our final word when it comes to the Heliborne brand in general. Expect more news in the upcoming months!<br><br>IS ENHANCED EDITION WORTH YOUR MONEY?<br><br>If you’re new to Heliborne or you had it wishlisted but always wanted to wait for a “definitive” edition of the game or a cool discount, now is the time to fly. Why? Because you get the basic game and over a dozen of cool DLC in one edition and at a very decent price. Here’s a short summary of your ‘savings’ if you decide to buy Enhanced Edition (compared to older versions):<br><br>The old version of the game was 19,99 USD\/EUR. The DLCs are altogether worth   54,85 USD\/EUR... So, if you’d want to gather the whole package, it would then cost you around 75 USD\/EUR.<br>From August 20, the 75 USD\/EUR value content will be priced at 29,99 USD\/EUR... As simple as that!<br>Sooo, you get EVERYTHING at once and you SAVE 60%!<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Fly some of the best helicopters in the world – from the classic machines of the 1950s to the modern gunships of the 21st century.
