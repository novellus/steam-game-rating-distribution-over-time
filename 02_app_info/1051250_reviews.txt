Once the buzzer goes off and the 24 hours starts EVERYONE is coming for you, your health and ammo is so low and the physics are really bad, you can't see bullets at all, if you play with headphones you'll notice that all the shooting audio comes out of the LEFT side, that's it. DO NOT buy this game, even though it was only 50 cents on sale, I'm getting a refund for it it was so much of a waste of money.\n\nPLEASE, MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, EVER, IT DOES NOT MATTER, UNLESS THEY UPDATE IT TO MAKE IT BETTER THIS GAME IS SO BAD IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY, honestly.","timestamp_created":1608078328,"timestamp_updated":1608078328,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjIC8tPYCeK/JugI="}
