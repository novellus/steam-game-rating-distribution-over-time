It was money down the drain in my case, since the gameplay didn't engage me one bit, and just felt boring and unimaginative. In case anyone cares, I'd give the companion game - Ace of Words a 5.5/10 - and slim thumbs up. Cheers\n\n(BTW - Time in Game reflects approximately 1 hour of actual gameplay and remainder of time was game idling overnight for Trading Card drops)","timestamp_created":1498677448,"timestamp_updated":1505667579,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512945950031280518","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4x/+xyN4CfLfafQ=="}
