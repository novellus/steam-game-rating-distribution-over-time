    review: '(EDIT: Turns out that they recently added a setting to turn off the voice
      acting.)


      Unfortunately, I personally disliked the voice acting in this game. It''s not
      that I thought that the voice acting was bad, but more so that I was so used
      to reading the dialogue myself. Hearing voices for characters that I had originally
      read to myself in the previous games really threw me off.


      Fortunately, that was my only gripe with the game. And after learning about
      the voiceless version that you can download online I happily played through
      the game. Though it is a shame that I wont get any achievements on Steam.'
