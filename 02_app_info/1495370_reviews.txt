There really isn't more to say. Don't buy it.\n\nSo, developer wanted feedback from my 10 min gameplay.\nYour first mission in the game is to make toys. Toys that fly out of your hands for no reason whatsooever. Like the truck, it keept getting stuck inside the table, the wheels where constantly respawing, like it was raining wheels on the table. Trying to guess where the wheels go, was just gussing. Guess wrong, the wheel fell TROUGH the truck, if you even managed to hold on to the truck without it flying away.\nAlso, i have no idea how many time i got stuck inside the table, or it showed my away from the table.\nSo there you go. All I could take was 10 min of this utter garbage.","timestamp_created":1608802520,"timestamp_updated":1609004368,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469023317098617554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609485125,"developer_response":"Thank you for taking time to update the review, and sorry you had a bad experience.
