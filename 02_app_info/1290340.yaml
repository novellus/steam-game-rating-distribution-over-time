    about_the_game: In this universe, the Zenith are long dead; only the mindless
      automatons called Golems are left behind, toiling away millennia after the fall
      of their civilization. But what of other universes?  A universe where the Zenith
      still live would not likely be one in which humans could have flourished and
      taken to the stars.  Multiverse theory has been around for hundreds of years,
      since back on Old Earth.  It had never been tested.  <br><br>Then one day in
      the middle of our war with the AI, the first of an oncoming horde of Zenith
      came through from a neighboring universe.  To them this was a post-apocalyptic
      starscape littered with the corpses of their kin.  These are Zenith in their
      prime, confused as to the state of affairs in our galaxy, and not exactly pleased
      with their findings.<br><br><i>Zenith Onslaught</i> is the second expansion
      for AI War 2. It's focused on making the galaxy feel rich and complex and changeable
      in new ways. It primarily provides Zenith-based factions that have their own
      agendas independent of humanity, unlike <i>The Spire Rises</i>, where all the
      factions were much more interested in the player (for good or ill).<h2 class="bb_tag">Major
