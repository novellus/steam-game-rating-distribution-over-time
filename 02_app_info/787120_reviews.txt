I'll check next time to see if there was actually a patch update on this before I try it again, I'll change the review if everything works better. \n\nEDIT EDIT: To the dev it's the ENTIRE start of the gameplay. Everything leading up to getting the doll head, I posted in the bug reports about exactly what happens. My weapon passes through the enemies and I get hit also.","timestamp_created":1604222103,"timestamp_updated":1604629917,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1604280813,"developer_response":"Hi, sorry to hear about this. The majority of the bugs should be fix in the first few months of release after the feedback but I probably missed some hidden ones.\n\nCan you describe specifically which areas of the game it crashed and falling off areas? Is it in the first level where you wake up? thanks"}],"cursor":"AoJ41K3ZzfUCeI3BqwI="}
