My breaking point was some level called emerald jungle in which spiders come out and when you kill them it spawns 10 - 20 little spiders.  I have every tower base with a level 2 or 3 aoe tower but it makes no difference - you get crushed.   \n\nAs you conquer sections you are able to raise your infamy (currency) to hopefully build more towers. But on my game there is only one place to advance and it's the so far for me unwinnable after 4 days.\n\nAlso the tech tree is quite laughable.  Most of the items after mid game are lame like \"take tree health and turn it into infamy\"  I would much rather have \"increase rate of fire or damage. \n\nMuch better out there w/o frustrating players to the point you want to toss your monitor out the window.","timestamp_created":1549426193,"timestamp_updated":1549426193,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546414196491241455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pu6/4OgCcqePugE="}
