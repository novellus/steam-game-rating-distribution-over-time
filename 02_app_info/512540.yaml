    review: "Updated January 5, 2021\n\n\tNote, This map is brutal. Even the easy\
      \ starter zones are difficult. Expect to die a lot from predators, heat stroke,\
      \ rapid dehydration, even freezing cold, until you can get established in a\
      \ relatively safe sheltered location. Know how to survive on The Island before\
      \ you attempt the challenge of a desert outback style wasteland.\n\n\tSome game\
      \ hints that will prolong your survival on \u201CScorched Earth;\u201D\n\n1.\
      \ Avoid running unless trying to escape from the numerous predators. Running\
      \ will overheat you using up water faster.\n2. As quick as you can, level up\
      \ on fortitude and get thatch clothes. They will help you resist the heat.\n\
      3. Water is going to be hard to find. Hitting a cactus with your fist or tools\
      \ will help to refill your water meter. Take advantage of that mechanic given\
      \ that berries are nearly useless as a water source.\n4. Water can be found\
      \ on jug bugs. Walk up behind one and get a drink when prompted.\n5. Water veins\
      \ are a good source for water. Walk into one and get a drink when prompted.\
      \ Later, you will be able to craft a well to place over it so you can refill\
      \ your containers, use irrigation plumbing with it, or water a Morellatop tame.\n\
      6. Ponds full of water can also be found in the canyons or under the three Obelisks.\
      \ However, like in a real desert, the presence of water attracts predators of\
      \ all types in large numbers.\n7. Don\u2019t waste your time or engram points\
      \ on getting water skins or jars. They leak so quickly that by the time you\
      \ need them, they are empty.\n8. There are places on the map that are naturally\
      \ cooler then the rest of the surrounding terrain. Should you find one, consider\
      \ constructing your campsite in that area.\n9. As soon as you can, learn how\
      \ to craft a tent. It will provide portable shelter from adverse weather such\
      \ as the heat wave and sandstorms. The silk for a tent can be found in some\
      \ types of flowers.\n10. Tame a Jerboa. It will warn you of adverse weather\
      \ approaching thus giving you a chance to get into shelter. Heat waves can kill\
      \ with heat stroke. Sandstorms sap you and your tame\u2019s stamina. Electrical\
      \ storms will disable metal weapons,cryopods, and damage your electrical systems.\
      \ \n11. Build an Adobe Hut. Adobe will protect you from a desert heat wave.\
      \ Other then thatch, any other structure will function as an oven during the\
      \ daytime.\n12. Craft Desert Armor. Unlike Gillie Armor, wearing a full suit\
      \ of Desert Armor will cut your water usage in half as it insulates you from\
      \ the extreme heat.\n13. Your most useful early tame will be a Morellatop. They\
      \ are great at gathering resources such as wood, thatch, cactus sap, silk, berries.\
      \ They can also hold their own against a predator when ridden. Best of all,\
      \ they can serve as a portable water source when they have water in their hump.\
      \ That can be filled by taking them into a pond, next to a well, or during a\
      \ rare desert rainstorm. Find one alone to tame as all of their buddies will\
      \ attack you.\n14. As usual, rare resources can be found on dangerous mountain\
      \ tops and in caves. Some metal and pearls can be found along the canyon riverbed.\
      \ Be aware that some oddly colored boulders may come to life and flatten you\
      \ with a boulder.\n15. The most sought after tame will be a Wyvern. The range\
      \ attack of a lightning can be most devastating compared to the fire breathers\
      \ and poison spitters. A saddle is not required to ride on one. They are a fast\
      \ way to get around on a map. However, getting one is going to be a real challenge\
      \ as you cannot tame a wild Wyvern, you have to steal an egg from a nest and\
      \ hatch it, then steal highly perishable wyvern milk from a knocked out female.\n\
      16, The drops can supply with useful items such as an Oil Pump which can be\
      \ placed over an oil vein.\n17. Numerous Explorer Notes are now on this map.\
      \ Wait until you have a good flier such as an Argy or Wyvern to level the both\
      \ of you up quickly.\n\nGood luck surviving and, as always, be prepared for\
      \ the unexpected."
