      \ /><br><br>Codemancer brings the mystery of magic and the exhilaration of learning\
      \ to code together in a fantasy universe that uses spell-casting as a way to\
      \ teach and learn programming skills. Codemancer\u2019s fantasy universe is\
      \ filled with rival sorcerers and their minions for players to encounter along\
      \ their journey. Codemancer is a non-violent, entertaining, and educational\
      \ game designed to be inclusive and accessible to learners at any stage. Features\
      \ include a gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative\
      \ backbone, and a programming interface that\u2019s designed to be easy to understand\
      \ by kids with varying degrees of skill and experience. Codemancer breaks down\
      \ barriers that may have discouraged some kids from embracing technology and\
      \ elevates their screentime to be more productive and entertaining.  It isn\u2019\
      t a typical coding or technology game.<br><br><br><strong>WHAT IS CODEMANCER\
      \ ALL ABOUT?   </strong><br>Codemancer tells a moving story about Aurora, a\
      \ young, creatively talented girl who\u2019s trying to grow up, become independent,\
      \ and do good in the world in the face of incredible obstacles when her father\
      \ is suddenly kidnapped. Aurora has to embark on an adventure to save him as\
      \ she grows into a gracious and independent young woman. She must learn magic\
      \ spells to save her father, but the magic used in Aurora\u2019s world works\
      \ the same as programming does in ours. Inspire children to explore their potential\
      \ as they discover the magic of coding.<br><br><br><strong>CODEMANCER IS AN\
      \ EDUCATIONAL GAMING ADVENTURE:  </strong> <br>Codemancer is designed for 6\

      \ <br>Codemancer breaks down barriers that can hinder some kids from feeling\
