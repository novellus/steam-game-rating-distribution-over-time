      exploits of a vengeful heroine determined to strike down five prominent figures

      back into the shadows or boldly confronting your opposition head-on with your
      katana. <br><br><strong>Decisive Strikes: </strong>Dispatch all that oppose
      you with your lethal blade and razor wire or avoid their attacks with a holographic
      replicator and grappling hook to find a more advantageous position. <br><br><strong>Path
      to Vengeance:</strong> Battle through over fifteen complex missions as you stalk
      and cut down five closely guarded figures within a secretive conglomerate.'
