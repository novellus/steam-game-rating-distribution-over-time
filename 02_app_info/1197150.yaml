    review: "[i] My Experience [/i]\n\nI've played a few compelling games about conversing\
      \ with A.I.'s, most notably Event[0] and Rumu. I was a big fan of those games,\
      \ so I decided to see what aspects of conversing with an A.I. Em-A-Li explored.\n\
      \nUnfortunately, Em-A-Li is first and foremost a horror game, and any exploration\
      \ of ideas seemed to me like a distant second priority. While it's possible\
      \ that a potential player might ruminate on the events of the story, it seemed\
      \ to me that the developer's foremost intent is the frighten. Therefore, I can't\
      \ say I really enjoyed my time with the game. \n\nThat being said, developer\
      \ Yobob did an excellent job setting an ominous mood using only the RPGMaker\
      \ toolset. The game is bug-free and competently made."
