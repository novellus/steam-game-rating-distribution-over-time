If you care about your win loss record and ranking, just hope you do not get kicked out because it will give you a 0 score and a defeat. \n\n- In order to play with others online and add AI (when you can only find one human for instance) they make it difficult. You have to add a friend through steam first instead of simply adding seats for humans and AI. \n\n- Chat window does not open or make a sound when people comment. You have to open it and pay attention or you will not even notice. Voice chat would also be a great implementation.","timestamp_created":1603755266,"timestamp_updated":1609965416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5NXa7PYCfpmsqgI="}
