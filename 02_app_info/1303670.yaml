    review: "O jogo deu uma boa crescida desde o lan\xE7amento. Muitas melhorias de\
      \ qualidade de vida est\xE3o sempre vindo, de forma a reduzir os problemas mais\
      \ t\xE9cnicos na montagem dos puzzles (como o zoom, que antes era horr\xEDvel,\
      \ a movimenta\xE7\xE3o de tela).\nA quantia de puzzles era enorme j\xE1 na primeira\
      \ vers\xE3o e quando menos se espera, vem uma atualiza\xE7\xE3o com mais algumas\
      \ dezenas. Vale cada centavo, tranquilamente."
