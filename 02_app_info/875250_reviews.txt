This game would never lie to you.\nIt's therapeutic to watch the dragon's slithering movements as it travels through a simple but beautiful world.\nI'd definitely recommend this game if you want a quick lil' game with a beautiful golden dragon. \n\nYou eat deers, dogs & bunnies as you dodge trees & mountain sides at high speeds.\nFun!","timestamp_created":1597831742,"timestamp_updated":1597831742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo7CMg/QCeeOynAI="}
