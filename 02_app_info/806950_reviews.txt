Yes there are many glitches most of them are small. \n\nThis game is about air superiority or alternatively about defeating air superiority. I wish the aircraft would be destroyed by ships and ports in map mode. I never play the game in combat mode. Lack of AA effectiveness for both player and enemy in map mode is a great drawback and ultimately I only played it with carriers. Lots and lots of carriers which are way too quick to build compared to the historical schedules.\n\nI really really REALLY wish I could design my own ships. As in the tremendously classic game PTO IV. The finest game of this genre in existence by far. Allowed you to design your own ships with the tradeoffs in cost speed armaments and armor you would expect.\n\nIf you insist on being absolutely historical then you had better not let me win the game in 1944 with 50 carriers. Yeah that is on hard level. How can a nation build so many carriers? The enemy never fields a fleet of more than 4 carriers and 28 DD's with a few larger ships thrown in so all you need to do is build a fleet of carriers, say 5 or 6 which will utterly destroy the largest fleet you will possibly encounter. Easily done and you can field a dozen or so fleets with 5 or 6 carriers and mop them all up. Well it is fun to get over the initial hump. That is where the challenge is.\n\nYes this game has some work left on it and as I don't play the (clumsy) and needless combat mode the dual purpose guns never get to be assigned to kill aircraft. I simply used a lot of fighters. Once the enemy fighters are out of the way your bombers can destroy everything else as they are totally impervious to AA fire from enemy ships. \n\nI enjoyed it for about 100 hours but can only play it further with player ship designs and the map mode AA fix which will probably never happen.\n\n..","timestamp_created":1608036638,"timestamp_updated":1609477689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508978664875030518","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46pGW3vYCdO62ugI="}
