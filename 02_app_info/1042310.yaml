    review: "I can't give this game a good recommendation, simply because it's not\
      \ playable. I get the ride in the car at the beginning and then it repeats over\
      \ and over again. The one time I was able to get out of the car...the game crashed\
      \ on me.\n\nTrying to escape the game is not fun, either.\n\nIt may not seem\
      \ fair to give a negative rating to a game I have only 9 minutes of playtime\
      \ in, but I also didn't think it was fair that I couldn't get a refund on it\
      \ because it sat in my folder, unplayed, for a few weeks. It's not like I spent\
      \ a lot of money on it. \nIt's not going to remain in my games folder."
