The controls are clunky and make moving around far too tedious. I see no reason that this game needs to have physics, and it's only caused problems in my experience with the game. (In some cases, when you combine the speed-up power with one of the walls that moves up and down, you can clip off an edge and jump over the outer wall of the maze). \n\nI only got halfway through the game, but I saw nothing promising in it that compelled me to continue. There could be some interesting concepts in the mazes with the buttons that raise/lower walls (I actually quite liked how some buttons controlled multiple types of walls, that was clever!), but the fact that it was packaged as a ball-rolling game took away most of that enjoyment for me.","timestamp_created":1577749953,"timestamp_updated":1577749953,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nrfOrO8Cfv7A6AE="}
