I feel that the developer did pour their heart into it, however it still suffers a few problems and was clearly a mobile game, with certain areas asking you to tap, despite using a mouse and keyboard.\n\nIt's certainly fun for what it is, especially with different outcomes that can happen, depending who you accuse and how closely you look at the evidence.","timestamp_created":1529845081,"timestamp_updated":1529845081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uuz3mOQCc8aFpAE="}
