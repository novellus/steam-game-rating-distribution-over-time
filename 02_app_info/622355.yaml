    review: At first I was not amused with a few  blacked out buildings and longer
      loading times. However when I read the thumbs down reviews I was begining to
      think this was a bad purchase!. even at half price. well i am very pleased to
      say having taken basic advice like going in to FSX Scenery Library and un-ticking
      boxes and Disabling any other Scenery add-ons that were not required for the
      area I was Flying over. I have already installed VFR Scenery South west England/wales
      and the two add-ons work brilliantly together. Oh and I also reinstalled Farm
      strips a second time which seemed to help. Lastly I Verified the FSX -SE files
      using Steam's Properties Menu. well what ever I did it worked and is Fantastic
      even if loading times are still a little slow.
