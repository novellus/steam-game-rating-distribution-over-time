    review: 'Holy chit! What an awesome experience! I played it for an hour straight,
      not reading much about it at all. I played it too long actually, but it really
      felt like a nightmare. The in game clues led me to understand the strange loop
      I was stuck in... The only way to wake up is to look out!

      2020 edit: also check out Cave of the Petrified'
