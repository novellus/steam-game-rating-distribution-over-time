    developer_response: How long can you say that this is DLC music from the game
      (in a folder media) and clips ...Many people have asked me to give them original
      soundtrack. I added a video to this, because I wanted to add something bright.
      You can consider this a video art book.

    review: 'Wow.. no.. just no.


      The initial game was awesome. This however is nothing but a desperate and very
      cheap moneygrab.


      2 Cutscences, that have no rhyme or reason or even some kind of story or progression.
      They arent even voiced in the slightest. To actually "sell" those is just bad.


      While I loved the initial game, every DLC lost a bit more of its original flavor
      and spice. At this pace, im very skeptical of all future products from this
      dev.'
