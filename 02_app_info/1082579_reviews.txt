The skills that come from her accessories (\"Medical\" line) allow her to cast elemental AoE (\"Omni Ignis\" etc.) when she's the party leader. And this is available right at the start of the game, where normally these same spells are learned only from endgame weapons. Just stack as much INT (responsible for magical damage) as possible on Compa and you'll be one-shotting most mob groups for most of the game. Bosses won't be much harder if you overlevel just a bit (which doesn't take long). Also consider that with this, you start with a party of 4 characters, whereas the game progression is balanced for Neptune being alone for quite a while. So you get an easier, quicker, less frustrating early game. IMO this DLC is essential for having a pleasant (casual even) experience - if you're getting only one, get this one.","timestamp_created":1599417481,"timestamp_updated":1599417694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493589729070663452","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw86ausvQCd8mdoAI="}
