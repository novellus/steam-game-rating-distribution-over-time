It's beautiful and best looking among touhou doujin games.  Not gonna lie. This game is kind of a mess. Several performance issues and unpolished design here and there. The gameplay is not that satisfying as it show in trailer. It's not entirely unplayable. It's playable, just don't expect too much after seeing trailer. With the price it asked for, it's acceptable.","timestamp_created":1608414624,"timestamp_updated":1608414624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkO++vvYCevPEuwI="}
