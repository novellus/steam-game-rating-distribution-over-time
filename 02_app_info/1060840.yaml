    about_the_game: "Maze of Memories is a mildly challenging maze puzzle game where\
      \ the solution - the path from start to finish - is an outline of a known landmark\
      \ or place from around the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the levels are\
      \ easier while others are more difficult. It features 3 different sizes for\
      \ a total of 60 levels:<br />\r\n- 10 levels of 40x40<br />\r\n- 20 levels of\
      \ 76x50<br />\r\n- 30 levels of 120x70<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the mazes are\
      \ perfect mazes, meaning none of them has a loop in it and there is only one\
      \ solution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls are done either by the W.A.S.D.\
      \ buttons or by the arrow keys. Alternatively the mouse can be used as well\
      \ by clicking on the head of the &quot;snake&quot;. Clicking on it again or\
      \ using the keyboard movements disables this effect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ path that has already been taken is marked in the maze. This might help to\
      \ not to get lost twice in the same dead end. This feature can be turned off/on\
      \ in the lower right corner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome tips:<br />\r\n- if it\
      \ seems that you are stuck then somewhere along the way you've taken a wrong\
      \ turn. Maybe right at the start.<br />\r\n- sometimes the way forward goes\
      \ backwards.<br />\r\n- sometimes the correct path can be seen just by looking\

    review: I finished all of these mazes in 3 days (an hour a day). I would put on
      my music and mindlessly play through the mazes. It was a nice way to wind down
      after a long day.
