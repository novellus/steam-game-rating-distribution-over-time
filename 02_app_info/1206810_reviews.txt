You have three tools at your disposal. A net, scissors, and a vacuum. To clean the fruit, you need to jump on them. After cleaning the fruit, it will be eaten and you are given a coin. Once you collect three coins, you will be able to buy your true desire. \n\nThe game is under 10 minutes long, and not much replay-ability here. It's cute though.","timestamp_created":1609123380,"timestamp_updated":1609123380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwssfO0/YCer37vQI="}
