Astraia is a mechanical genius in a city of exploited mages and manufacturers. Her father, Kofi, is a brilliant man broken by the military\/industrial machine for which he’s been forced to work. Together, they try to scrap together a life in the slums as the city’s tensions mount around them. Astraia wants liberation and the thrill of adventure. Kofi just wants his daughter to keep her head down and stay out of trouble. But Astraia’s resolve can’t be tempered, and she quickly finds herself mired in an all-too-adult world of political turmoil, organized crime, and frightening magical technology. An adventure awaits Astraia as she comes to terms with the hardness and truth of an encompassing real world.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis prologue is an early version of what we intend for the main game. In its current iteration, the game will demonstrate a real time action combat system with crystals that will give the player different types of attacks. In the final version, we will add more crystals, polish the effects, add variety to the types of attacks, and fine tune\/balance the combat mechanics. The prologue will be limited to one level which is an abandoned factory. The final version will have several areas to explore and added exploration mechanics and puzzles. The narrative for the prologue is limited to a part of the character's story as the main focus of this is to demonstrate the combat and exploration mechanics. The main game will have a fully flushed out narrative that focuses on Astraia's origin and her pursuit to build the perfect golem.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe are currently in the development process for the prologue and will continue to update the art assets, combat and exploration mechanics.","about_the_game":"In a volcanic city oppressed by a distant empire, an ailing child prodigy struggles to make her way in the world after her family is shattered by the loss of her mother.
