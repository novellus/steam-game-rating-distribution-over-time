    about_the_game: Marked by the revolts and rebellions of the March Revolution,
      the German petty states are on the brink of economic collapse. However, with
      the appearance of the first private trains, cross-border connections are increasingly
      growing, linking the larger cities and creating industrial centers that will
      lift the troubled country. In the <strong>Railway Empire - Germany DLC</strong>
      you will be a central part of this movement. Strengthen your influence as a
      railway magnate within Germany and exploit new building grounds by acquiring
      valuable concessions.

    review: 'Messed up city names from Carlsruhe to Stuttgardt, somewhat annoying
      AI opponents (basically the same guys you have in the base game, only with different
      names and horrible "german" accents) and a map that can''t decide if it wants
      to include the Empire (as it does in the east with bohemian and eastern prussian
      towns) or not (as it doesn''t include the Alsace, Danish or Dutch landscapes)...
      Furthermore the "snow" functionality is too simplified to really be fun (why
      is there snow from Flensburg to Leipzig every winter, but never in the Alps?)

      All that could be fixed easily with a relatively simple overhaul, but for now
      I cannot recommend it as it''s just frustrating to play the map'
