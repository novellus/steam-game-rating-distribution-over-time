Be a spectator. Watch the cars zoom past once and not see them for awhile until they are on lap 2 or 3 etc. You can walk about the map. Hell you must be strong as I was able to push an accelerating car into the wall just by sprinting at it. (I do admit I did try to have my self killed by walking into the oncoming path of one of the cars but it just stopped right in it's tracks and I was not hurt). Another thing I noticed is that the cars can't seem to reverse properly (either that or the drivers are extremely incompetent). The last thing I will point out is the countless graphical glitches around the map, I am talking about various trees popping in, invisible bridges as well as invisible barriers. Not only that but the barriers you can see aren't terribly well modelled. This would of been a good demonstration piece for maybe a school project but as a game that you can spend real life money on? I don't think so. Don't get this game. At least for now. Maybe in the future the developer might add updates and other things that would improve the game.","timestamp_created":1599769474,"timestamp_updated":1599769474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548475384712219238","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvZ7svPQCc6SCoQI="}
