Value for money, for an adult the game is not worth the money as it is short, it took me 5 1/2 hour to do, but for a kid this will give them plenty of time playing the game, so would i recommend the game, it would be a no for adults but a yes for kids","timestamp_created":1606138596,"timestamp_updated":1606138596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqsHU+vUCcpSIsAI="}
