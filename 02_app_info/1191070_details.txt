It's not a perfect experience of course, with too many items being handed to you while not knowing what still needed to be used and what you were done with. Overall though I enjoyed the experience and don't regret the purchase.”<br>Recommended – <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OIfXZMpBpYs&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >GoodKhaos<\/a><br><br>“Scariest game of 2019 no joke! Chilla's Art did it again, they develop a game that is terrifying as no other. This game is similar to Aka Manto but scariest because there is no way to hide from Yuki Onna, she is very unpredictable, and her transformation is going to make you scream for sure. I recommend this game 100% and more if you love horror, and Japanese legendary ghosts.”<br>Recommended – <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EipdkitoxqY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGXL Insane Gaming XL<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1191070\/header.jpg?t=1607480173","website":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChillasArt","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 SP1+<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel\/Amd<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Integrated graphics<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 3 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Yes<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Please wear headphones<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"<strong>Yuki Onna | 雪女 © Chilla's Art, LLC 2020<br>All rights reserved.<\/strong>","developers":["Chilla's Art"],"publishers":["Chilla's Art"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":499,"final":499,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"$4.99"},"packages":[409987],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Yuki Onna | 雪女","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":409987,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Yuki Onna | 雪女 -
