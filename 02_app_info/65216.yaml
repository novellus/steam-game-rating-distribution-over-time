    review: One of the older routes for the Train Simulator series and it does show
      with low res textures aplenty (especially on the trains).  The route lacks a
      feeling of life or a sense of place, but it runs well and is a very relaxing
      route to drive.  If you can get it on sale for $5-$10 it's a winner.
