This game is pretty good.  It's pretty much like a Warcraft 3 spiritual successor.  Better than WC3 Reforged in a lot of ways.  \n\nAs much as I want to love this game however I can't pretend I'm not disappointed.  The game was released unfinished, and abandoned very quickly.  I don't think Daedalic had any faith in it, they released it before it was ready and didn't even give it a chance to build momentum and customer faith.  They were hoping for a big launch with their unfinished early access game, didn't get it, and abandoned the game rather than wait.  As a game dev I understand the circumstance, but you can't expect an EA title to sell like a finished one.  It does come with a beefy campaign, that can be played solo or coop.  It has full on voice acting, in game cutscenes, etc.  Plus skirmish mode, and of course Online mode.  So the content is there, it was mostly finished even, but as expected needed work, which is the whole point of early access.  Pathfinding can be pretty bad sometimes, which REALLY hurts the play experience in an RTS.  Other than that however the game-play is pretty polished and AYOR really gives WC3 reforged a run for it's money IMO.  I do hate the Coop AI, because I prefer to play solo and I have always hated Coop RTS campaigns with AI allies (like Red Alert 3) but still the game has SO MUCH potential it makes me depressed.  I'm just disappointed that Daedalic seemingly launched this game to try and make back as much of their money as possible without ever really planning to support it, they basically lied about it, but in an underhanded way so they could shrug off blame. \n\nThey launched it as early access, but I really don't believe they ever planned to support the game unless it was a smash hit right out of the gate, which to me is kind of insane to expect.  Early access is supposed to support further development, not be your big money making release.  I understand, first hand, how difficult the industry is right now, but these types of situations only further shake customer faith in new ambitious projects.  If Daedalic can sell a game for 40 bucks, promising to support it's development further and then just dump it a few months later, then how can anyone be optimistic about early access. Launches that are handled like this are one of the reasons the industry is in such a sorry state in the first place.  The worst part is that the devs that actually worked on the game are certainly very passionate about A Year of Rain and it shows, but their higher ups clearly never had much faith in it at all.  \n\nOverall I recommend the game if you can get it on sale for the campaign alone, but I am very disappointed with how the game was handled and it still needs a major bugfix and QOL pass.  In my opinion it was never given enough of a chance to become what Daedalic wanted it to be because they would just rather cut their losses and move on.  Now A Year of Rain will just fade into RTS obscurity and from the amount of passion that was put into it I really feel it deserved more.  This could have been a fantastic WC3 styled RTS and really could have been something big in the RTS genre.  Now it's just completely dead. Thanks Daedalic, I will never purchase another EA title from you again.
