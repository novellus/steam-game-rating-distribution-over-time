    review: Overall a decent game. I had to do alot of playing around in the Steam
      controller configuration to get the controls right. I have them set pretty closely
      to the Ace Combat control scheme. tip with the config as well, set your sticks
      to act like D-pads and change your roll and turn features around to get a simulation
      style control if you dont want an arcade style. the voice acting is terrible
      but hey you can always turn it off. the only other complaint i have is the difficulty
      leveling can kinda be random. one min your dominating the skies the next your
      a brand new pilot that just learned how to fly. But again decent WW2 Flight
      sim. also ive seen alot of complaints about the game not starting at all. my
      computer is old and im working off of an Intel Celeron N2840. i had to switch
      the properties over to windows XP service pack 3. runs like a dream. no patch
      needed.
