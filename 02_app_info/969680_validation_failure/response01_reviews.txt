You will curse a lot when you get crushed by your opponents and bath in their tears when you are winning.\n\nThere are no lootboxes or gameplay affecting items to buy for real money. \n\nIt's a fun game with a really nice community and responsive developers.","timestamp_created":1565257740,"timestamp_updated":1565257740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699595510959625244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7rWouOwCe7j6zwE="}
