    review: 'Enjoyable game! Completed over the course of 3 days, about 5 hours total
      of gameplay.


      Astrohazard Solutions Ltd. combines Asteroids-reminiscent gameplay with a good
      story about the employees of an unethical corporation. The company earns its
      profit by removing space junk, asteroids, and other hazards away from its clients''
      property. You are the Operator of your team, controlling the drone that must
      push these hazards away before the object you''re protecting gets damaged. The
      problem? This company might be bent TOO much on profits over ethics.


      Game missions are fun, have some variety, can have amusing twists to them, and
      are integrated into the progressing plot. Initially I found that the difficulty
      levels and controls were perfectly balanced, with some challenge but still doability
      to each mission. However, as I upgraded my stats and became more strategic with
      my gameplay, I came to a point where many later missions could be completed
      easily by staying in one spot on the screen and pushing everything away from
      there. I would have liked more chances to have the AstroTractor and AstroMines
      be useful instead of relying solely on the AstroBeam/AstroShield; to have to
      move around more on the screen to remove hazards; and would have been happy
      with harder difficulties and longer levels.


      The story is about the same level of complexity as the gameplay. It''s straightforward
      but successful, with thought about the dangers of an unethical corporation,
      good points of humor and personality, and noticeable characterization within
      the main cast.'
