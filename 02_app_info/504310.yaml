    review: "Update: As of Dec. 19, 2019 this game was made f2p. People that had the\
      \ game in their steam library before the special update received a special offer\
      \ that they can claim when they boot the game up that gives diamonds and in-game\
      \ cash.\n\nThis obviously a port of a mobile game to pc, in which the in game\
      \ purchases have been removed. And to be honest I was looking for a game like\
      \ this on pc to play, without the extra purchases. I had played a few of them\
      \ on mobile, but never paid extra so of course you can only go so far on those\
      \ with the extra pay. \n\nI was having real fun playing this, completed the\
      \ first two restaurant all with three stars and fully upgrade. Get to the third\
      \ business, a cake and slurpee joint and low and behold I am stuck. Stuck due\
      \ to lack of diamonds, things you are awarded during play when finishing levels.\
      \ So now that this third store needs even more diamonds to upgrade things, very\
      \ high charges of 10-20 diamonds on a lot of it, and I can no longer complete\
      \ levels with three stars without upgrading. I now have to hang out at the \"\
      casino\" endlessly spinning the wheel trying to get diamonds. \n\nSo I went\
      \ from having fun to getting bored silly spinning a \"roulette\" wheel that\
      \ only gives 2 diamonds a pop when you actually land on the diamond giveaway\
      \ slot. And I also had 90k in money, which has dwindled down to 29k and now\
      \ I only have 2 diamonds. I will probably consider this game done and uninstall,\
      \ what a waste. Too bad because the game WAS fun.\n\nThis is a DEFINITE no buy,\
      \ unless you like to be frustrated a lot, not by your skill level or a challenging\
      \ game, but by a lack of foresight by a dev when bringing a mobile port to pc,\
      \ then by all means grab it  lol"
