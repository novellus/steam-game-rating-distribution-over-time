    review: "Komme ziemlich weit am Anfang beim Szenario Frachtwechsel nicht weiter.\
      \ Neben den Schienen am Boden ein rotes Signal gleich am Start  - das  ich nicht\
      \ \xFCberfahren darf - ansonsten wird Szenario abgebrochen. Obwohl ich erst\
      \ in 500 m am roten Signal anhalten soll. Mehr als 20 mal neugestartet half\
      \ nichts. \nWenn es behoben wird gibts wieder Daumen hoch."
