    review: 'A first person horror game where you enter an asylum looking for your
      daughter and, of course, things get weird.  I don''t play a lot of horror games
      but this one struck me as being pretty formulaic and straight-forward in terms
      on mechanics and game-play.  You can''t do much against the "bad things" so
      it is mainly running and hiding while trying to progress.


      The main goal is to not die (surprise) and find out what happened to your daughter.  You
      do this by finding her diary pages and finding things to help you progress through
      the hospital.  That''s it really.  The layout changes randomly so it can be
      pretty disorienting.  Is it scary?  I would say it is more tense then scary
      but it does have it''s jump scare moments.  The game only lets you save in certain
      places and with the layout being random, it can sometimes be a while before
      you can save so it can get somewhat frustrating too.  Not the best system but
      does make the game a little more tense.


      The game has some pretty big problems though.  The controls are really bad.  Trying
      to equip an item usually means pressing the appropriate key 4 to 5 times.  No
      clue why, no other game I''ve played has had that problem so assume it will
      happen for everyone.  Also I ran into a bug that made me lose my saved game.  I
      could load it but the screen was black and I couldn''t do anything.  Of course
      it happened when I was pretty far into the game.  If you play you might want
      to back up your saves (AppData/LocalLow/GameMechanics/The Hat Man _ Shadow Ward).  The
      game is very short though so it wasn''t that big a deal in the end.


      So the game is simple, short, not that scary and is also held back by outdated
      graphics, bad controls, poor save mechanics and a potential save bug that can
      make you lose your progress.  It''s not the worst game but I certainly wouldn''t
      recommend it.'
