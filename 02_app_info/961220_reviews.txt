What lost me in the end was the gore, the story could have been told the exact same way without it, and the way it was used seemed to just be trying to gross you out with it for shock value. \n\nUltimately while I wouldnt recommend the game I wouldnt say its bad, it just isnt for me, which is unfortunate because I thought the premise was very interesting.","timestamp_created":1596769361,"timestamp_updated":1596769361,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537037014961242676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xtu34/MCc9LwmQI="}
