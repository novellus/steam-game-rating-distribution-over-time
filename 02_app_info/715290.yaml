    review: "Segfault is pretty bad, even at 90% off I don't recommend it. And yes,\
      \ I only played it under an hour and decided this. \n\nIt's a keyboard-only\
      \ shooter (arrow keys and z/x : you can't change the controls in options) where\
      \ the viewpoint is too \"zoomed-in\" so everything's too close to see bullets\
      \ coming, and momentum / gravity slow you down so much that you can't get out\
      \ of the way anyway. If I can describe it via another game - imagine trying\
      \ to play Luftrausers with 1/8th screen size and slightly sluggish controls.\n\
      \nAlso the only method of upgrading your ship / firepower is through a lootcrate-esque\
      \ system, so you can't strategise and plan what to get, you pay your in-game\
      \ currency and beg and are supposed to be happy with what you're given. Even\
      \ though it's not what you need. All it does is add a layer of frustration.\n\
      \nAwful, bad design decisions in this game."
