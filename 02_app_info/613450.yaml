      /><br><strong>Please Knock on My Door</strong> is a story-driven game which
      gives you control over a person suffering from depression and social anxiety.
      Help them get through work and reach out to friends while desperately trying
      to survive. Experience the frailty these themes bring and gain a better understanding
      of what it's like to live with some of the most common mental health issues

      /><br>Please Knock on My Door has been in development since autumn 2014 and
      was initially supposed to be a 6 month exploration of my own experiences with
      depression. A word of caution; this is a game that might be difficult to play
      for those who have dealt with psychological issues such as depression and anxiety.
      That said, I truly believe that through entertainment we are able to understand
      topics that would otherwise be too foreign for us. I hope this game can help
      you better understand what it can be like to live with these issues, like it
      has already helped me.

    review: This game is beautiful and simplistic. It's a perfect story of mental
      health and depression, it explains the state and the spiral downwards in a way
      I have not seen before in a game. The experience is tough on you, and this might
      have been the first time I wanted to step in to a game and give our character
      a hug, some food and just exist in their life telling them that they are not
      alone.  I will replay it again sometime when I myself feel better. And don't
      forget, it's cool to cry. 10 of 10 tears!
