Personally would have preferred Yhwach (included on behalf of being the overarching villain of Bleach), but Yoruichi's is a great alternative representative. As far as the character pass goes, characters are modeled and presented with all proper respect to their respective animes.\n\nFor a review of the game itself, check out my review!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamWorksPower/recommended/816020?snr=1_5_9__402","timestamp_created":1606175842,"timestamp_updated":1607099380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612903177738189697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwks6ll/YCfbaTsAI="}
