    about_the_game: "Chicken Invaders puts players at the forefront of a battle against\
      \ invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for\
      \ our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed\
      \ a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with\
      \ the ultimate goal of destroying Christmas by encrusting humanity in an impenetrable\
      \ wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to\
      \ foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon\
      \ before it reaches Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Christmas Edition is characterized\
      \ by festively dressed chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups\
      \ and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated\
      \ by fights against massive enemies disguised as Christmas elves, Santas, and\
      \ other well-known holiday figures. Major enemies are also appropriately decorated\
      \ with rows of blinking Christmas lights. Christmas ornaments, bows, ribbons,\
      \ bells, and holly fly everywhere during the heat of battle. Floating Christmas\
      \ gifts can be collected in order to extend the arsenal at the player's disposal.\
      \ There's even a suitably festive snow blizzard -- in deep space! On-screen\
      \ action is accompanied by original renditions of popular Christmas carols,\
      \ composed specifically for this episode."
