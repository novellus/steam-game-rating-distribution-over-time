    review: "I did not think I would like this game, but I really did! \nAs is probably\
      \ obvious to anyone reading this, this is a standalone game that tells the story\
      \ of characters from the world of \"The Witcher\" (specifically CPRs Witcher),\
      \ and it does so by using an overland-map system that permits you to move your\
      \ group around (in a way similar to Heroes of Might and Magic 3) and then battles\
      \ are fought by actually playing the card game \"Gwent\" from the witcher 3,\
      \ except the Gwent game has been modified heavily from the original game.\n\
      I did not think I would have enjoyed this game, but I really did! I do think\
      \ it is a shame that they modified the Gwent mechanics from the way they originally\
      \ were in the Witcher 3, but even though I enjoyed the original Gwent mechanics\
      \ a lot, the new version is fun too. \n\nMy main beef with this game is that,\
      \ if you miss something, it is kind of tricky to go back and undo your choices,\
      \ so if you are a completionist, I recommend reading a guide before you act."
