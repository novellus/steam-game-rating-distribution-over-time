I put hours upon hours upon hours in to it filled with nothing but pure joy and ecstasy. This game has been an amazing addition to my life, helped me through some dark times. I've only ever played 2 games i've put this amount of time, effort and love in to; Shadow of The Colossus, and Put In - Run Out. This game is amazing, so with a heavy heart I say these words.\n\nI CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.\n\nThis game could've been so much more. The bustling E-Sports scene got absolutely no support from the devs, in fact the only updates ever implemented hindered the athletes and hampered the overall experience of the game. And that was when the devs atleast tried to update the game. Ruskija Game Experience has completely abandoned this game, leaving the most adamant of supporters in the wind to fend for themselves. This game had the potential to be the next Fortnite killer, but instead it just ended up becoming another game abandoned and forgotten by the devs and players alike.\n\nMy friends and I used to have so much fun with the online portion of this game, wether it was casual or competitive the gameplay was smooth and responsive. The netcode of this game has only gotten worse and worse, the servers have been abandoned by the devs and they left the players to create the servers themselves. I HATE THE DEVS OF THIS GAME, THEY RUINED EVERYTHING!\n\nI miss all the good times I used to have in this game, to those who may have gotten the game recently, if you truly enjoy the game, great! It's an amazing game, but when you've seen what it could've been, you've gone to hell and back.... :(\n\nAll in all, this game is a FUCKING PIECE OF $HIT! I WISH, I COULDVE HAD MORE TIME WITH THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS THE AMAZING LITTLE JEWEL IT WAS BUT NO! THE DEVS JUST HAD TO FUDGING GO AND RUIN IT WITH THEIR PETTY LITTLE GREEDY HANDS... IF I HAD THE CHANCE TO GO BACK IN TIME I WOULD TELL MYSELF NEVER TO PLAY THIS GAME, BECAUSE ALL THAT WAS WAITING FOR ME WAS PAIN, AND ANGUISH AND HURT! \n\nF*UCK I HATE THESE DEVS! \nI HATE HUMANITY!","timestamp_created":1609694710,"timestamp_updated":1609694710,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616519153118133545","comment_count":18,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj4HS5PYCd4GRwAI="}
