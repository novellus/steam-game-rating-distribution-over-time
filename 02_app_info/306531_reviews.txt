You almost can't find where you stopped reading last time.\nBut when GMing, you can use NPCs from NPC sidebar button, so module is playable.\nAnyway, some my friends do not buying this product only because they like to read good converted reference.\nSadly, this reference manual looking great, but not separated into useful pages.","timestamp_created":1518357964,"timestamp_updated":1518357964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzvzLwuECd9DMmAE="}
