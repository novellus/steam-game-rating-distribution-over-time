No development updates or anything. It's definitely a cool concept and fun for a few hours, but that fun will eventually just get boring and repetitive. IF the the developers decided to reawaken and continue to develop this game then I might change my review, but at the moment there is no update DON'T waste $20 on an abandoned vr-game. Your better off finding or making a custom map in Boneworks or half life Alyx then play this.","timestamp_created":1604811436,"timestamp_updated":1604811436,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw/uWN0/UCebmIrQI="}
