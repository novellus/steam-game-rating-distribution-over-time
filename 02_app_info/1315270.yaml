    review: The most beautiful and life changing experience i've ever had in a videogame,
      if you can even call it that. The sheer power of your piss blasting out of your
      shlong was so mesmerizing and gave me so much euphoria I cant even describe
      it. When I first began all i had were questions. "Why do I have so much piss?"
      "Where did all of my bodily fluids come from?" "Why did i spend $1.48 on this?"
      But I understand now. I was chosen by a higher power to witness first hand what
      true glory and magnificence looks like. The more I played the more i became
      addicted to this simulation. As I fought the final boss, the battleship, The
      inner machinations of my mind began to unfold what the true meaning of life
      really was. As I reached out my hand to the bright yellow light and gazed upon
      its glory, I started to perceive what piss was really like in its true form.
      Just before it was within my grasp, my senses only seized one thing; I had beaten
      the game. My first thoughts were, "What, but... that's impossible. There is
      no end to this paradise, there can't be!" Now, as i'm writing this review, I
      now know that my life will never truly be the same.
