      A turn-based game about getting to safes by outsmarting cameras and guards,
      or simply using your invisibility device or tranquilizer, then breaking into
      safes via timed minigames.


      pros:

      - the concept

      - separate volume sliders

      - windowed mode


      cons:

      - everything else, including:

      - typos in the intro

      - ''europe'' over the continent of asia

      - buggy menus (''options'' on 3 labels in the main menu, ''play'' everywhere
      in the settings, everything is ''options'' in the pause menu)

      - buggy audio (oversensitive sliders, uneven music/effect levels, muted audio
      resets on restart)

      - buggy achievements (finish or even fail level 1 of a continent to get one
      for completing all of it)

      - level 9 is considered the last on each continent instead of #10, according
      to the next level button anyway, so don''t be surprised when you''re back at
      the map with no new continent unlocked, just play #10, which in turn will take
      you straight to #11 instead of back to the map

      - moves, points and credits mean or do anything

      - clicking the wait button does nothing, only space works but it''s not mentioned
      anywhere

      - no key for next level, have to click on it

      - no undo (not that it''s necessary)

      - no challenge whatsoever even without power-ups, partly because safes can be
      opened from any side

      - suitcases would add some, but they don''t do anything either, so not worth
      bothering with

      - I could probably go on...


      needless to say, avoid it even for free and definitely don''t pay a cent to
      support such lazy and/or incompetent developers.'
