First there is the problem with the keys, some small houses require a key and you have to find them but the problem is that they keys are nowhere to be found, I tried to find all of them but no luck, the most logical places where the key should be placed by the dev was empty but that's the smallest issue.\nThe other and bigger issue is the placement if invisible walls. First of all it's a shame that a game in 2019 uses tons of invisible walls. Whatever game are we talking about, invisible walls are always sign of bad level design and this game has a LOT of invisible walls but that's not the main problem.\nThe main problem is that there are places where invislbe walls should not exist (stairs, ladders etc.) and places where invisible wall should exist. There was a forest area with a house and ther ewere multiple paths to explore. One of these paths has a gamebreaking trap: you can jump over a small rock but after it ther eis a bush which you can't pass by, it behaves like a wall, so an invisible wall ront of you and another behind you = you can't move in any direction, you're stuck so it's game breaking bug and this happened only because the dev forgot to place an invisible wall. Because of the game breaking bug I had to quit to main menu and restart from the last checkpoint.\nHere is the other big issue with this game: the save points are extremely rare, if you encounter a clipping issue or a game breaking bug like in my case, you will lose a LOT of progress and that's extemely annoying. Why aren't there much more save points? Checkpoint saves is one of the biggest cancer in the gaming industry and this game shows exactly why.\nSo after I was placed back to the last save point which was more than 30 minutes before I encountered the game breaking bug, I just lost any interest to continue the game, such bullshit save system it's just bad game design and if we combine this with bad level design, well, just avoid this crap!\nIt's interesting that this game runs very well on a GTX1060 with huge amount of vegetation so performacne is good, but that doesn't save this game from a dislike, sorry.","timestamp_created":1605729321,"timestamp_updated":1605729915,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h8K97vUCeeOWrwI="}
