Movement is floaty, hitboxes are off, attacks are inconsistent, and levels fail to allow you to progress at times. The idea is good, but even a little playtesting should have let the dev know to go a different direction with this one. Too many obvious problems in the short time I played, which is disappointing. I would love to see this recreated in OpenBOR. Maybe then, it would work properly. Until then, pass on this one.","timestamp_created":1607528772,"timestamp_updated":1607528772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwms6LpPYCdpa1uAI="}
