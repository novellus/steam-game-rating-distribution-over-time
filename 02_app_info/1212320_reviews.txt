It is challenging and rewarding at the same time, and could be played for hours and hours. By the way the difficulty scales, you can really see that there was a lot of effort put in the game to make you give your best and not just shoot around aimlessly. If you want a game that reminds you of the cool old arcade games, this game is great for you!\nThe only minor thing I would suggest to be added in a future update is a button to quickly replay without needing to go back to the menu. But congrats anyway! Keep up the good work!","timestamp_created":1587094212,"timestamp_updated":1587094212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2vmLw/ECc8iwgQI="}
