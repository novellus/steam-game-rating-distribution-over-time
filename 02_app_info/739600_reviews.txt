Its good if you handle his misunderstanding situation, it might need remake because for guy he understood just girls being not on same page as he was...kind bothered me, He wasn't into too forward category they should had sign were getting married and doing it seemed it should be rated different setting Over teens...because breasts and it would be more adult comedy sort thing then teen comedy. Oh I seen the whole series somewhere else and it was good. It reminded Munto little bit, but kind wish he could hand the girls off to better partners? So he could had one of girls and princesss that was it...he seemed got better with just that one other girl seemed too violent and I was thinking he going killed by her and other girl going bury him.","timestamp_created":1529882269,"timestamp_updated":1529882269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41NqFmuQCfcyNpAE="}
