    review: 'After the slightly less challenging [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/recommended/522651]Indie
      Game Challenge Pack 1[/url], the ante is upped once again by Chiptune Pack 2.
      Although it doesn''t really reach the high of the first pack in terms of maximal
      difficulty, there are consistently more difficult song charts in this pack.


      On Hard mode, the easiest, Challenge by Chronowolf, is full of trills and syncopated
      patterns galore; Lazarus by Dya has a ton of consecutive notes and a few super-fast
      triplet sections, while ABXY from Popskyy is packed with trills AND fast triplet
      sections, in a few cases there''s an awesome fast triplet section occurring
      DIRECTLY after a note trill!


      While they don''t reach the high of Flow Unlimited from the first pack in terms
      of difficulty, these provide immense challenge in their own right. And then
      you have the 3 arena challenges, 3 items, blah blah blah...I''m kidding, but
      really, I get the packs more for the songs themselves than for the equipment
      personally. But that''s not to say that the equipment is useless - rather, they
      can be incredibly beneficial in certain circumstances.
