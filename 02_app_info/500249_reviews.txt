If your looking for a new and tough challenge then the Britannia is quite possibly your best bet. I will tell you a little story of how I came to buy this engine. First of all I had Just Trains' BR 6MT Clan Class my first engine I got from Just Trains as I had had standard steam locomotives with easy to get round controls. I should state I drove with automatic fireman on as I was more concerned with the driving aspect rather than the stoking and watering part of driving a steam locomotive. When I had the Clan Class out for the first time I struggled and started losing pressure once I got a few miles out of Dumfries on the WLOS. I eventually came to a stop and I struggled for days on end trying to figure it out. I then saw how to do it properly and I had to do the firing myself which was a new challenge and in doing so I fell in love with that engine. When I heard another Just Trains steam locomotive came out and it was the Britannia I was excited for it and I put it in my basket and started driving. With my experience from the Clan Class I thought I knew what I was doing but no it was a different challenge and I loved it. My firing of the engine was fine. my issue was injecting water into the boiler. I struggled for days trying to inject water into the boiler. I thought I wasn't using the right controls at first, but as it was of very similar design to the Clan Class I knew that wasn't what was wrong. The valves you need to inject water into the boiler I found needed to be put into a certain position to work and this changes when your picking up or losing speed, once I got round that I was running my Britannia like a dream and has quite quickly become one of my favourite along with the Clan Class. I can put on 13 coaches and I feel I can do everything and anything with it, pulled heavy freight work you'd expect with the 9F and it handled it pretty good may not be going at express speed but it does the job surprisingly well. I usually play on steam engine routes like the WLOS or Riviera Line in the 50's etc. So the Britannia's weathering comes in handy if you want to simulate those times. If your a steam locomotive fan, especially BR Standards then this one I would seriously consider for your collection.","timestamp_created":1602168179,"timestamp_updated":1602168179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k8mqhPUCe8nPpgI="}
