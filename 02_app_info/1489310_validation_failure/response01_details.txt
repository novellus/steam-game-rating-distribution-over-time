This is a place where you will meet various creatures, ranging from small to giant ones. In NecroCity you can meet skeletons, werewolves, goblins, zombies, ghosts, and other ugly monsters. NecroCity is a city-building economic strategy game, in which the action takes place in a secret land, whose residents are divided into two basic classes: people and monsters. In the game, you will play the role of the governor of a dark city. Your main task will be to build and manage the city, starting with a network of roads, buildings, and fortifications.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1489310\/extras\/necrocity-screen1.png?t=1607782160\" \/><br>Due to an extensive system of building improvements, you will be able to create your own amazing NecroCity.

Make your city self-sufficient and go with your army to conquer another land!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building the dark city<\/h2>One of the main mechanics in NecroCity is building and managing the available space. Start your NecoCity adventure with basic buildings, such as Tomb or Crypt. Each building has its own unique task and is essential for the development of your NecroCity. Some of them increase your maximum population, others generate the resources you need. As you progress in the game, you will gain access to much more expensive, but also much more powerful buildings, such as the Necromancer Mansion or Undead Sanctuary. <br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1489310\/extras\/necrocity-screen2.png?t=1607782160\" \/><br>To expand your city, you will need to extract and obtain resources from nearby mines and old tombs. Some of the resources may be available outside your city walls. To get them, send your units for this task. Use the obtained materials and resources to develop your NecroCity, thanks to them you will be able to expand your army or improve fortifications. Each of the buildings in the city will be an extremely important role in the functioning of the entire community. Thanks to the extensive system of building improvements, with the acquired experience, you will be able to improve the defensive wall around your city, add defense turrets and traps.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1489310\/extras\/necrocity-screen3.png?t=1607782160\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defense of the city<\/h2>The development and management of the city are not the only duties you have to take care of.

However, when the time comes you will have to face more powerful opponents - mounted and heavily armored knights, call your best units to fight. Regardless of whether you choose, the Necromancer or the army of the Undead to fight, your opponents will flee full of fear.
