      \ plays on the White House lawn that you can't get out of your head? They're\
      \ all here, along with the rest of the game's background music, the best of\
      \ the cinematic cutscene score, and five new tracks written especially for the\
      \ 2020 remaster of Sam &amp; Max Save the World. That's almost three hours of\
      \ music! <br><br>Written and arranged by composer Jared Emerson-Johnson and\
      \ given two thumbs-up by Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell:<br><br><strong>&quot;OF\
      \ COURSE</strong> this is how Sam &amp; Max's world sounds! Though the classic\
      \ noir textures drop me firmly in the late fifties, Jared has drawn inspiration\
      \ from a huge palette of genres and styles. He somehow blends the result seamlessly\
      \ with generous doses of wit and attitude. I couldn't be more pleased that this\
      \ is the music that carries us through Season One, and that this sizable body\
      \ of work can now be enjoyed on its own. If only my life had a soundtrack this\
      \ cool.&quot; <i>Steve Purcell</i> <br><br><strong>&quot;BELIEVE IT OR NOT,</strong>\

      \ and the surface of the moon\u2014all for the same magnificently deranged project.\
      \ For me, that is precisely what makes Steve's universe so unique and surprising;\

      \ Michael Whitwell, and Dale Gutridge. At any rate, I certainly hope the pleasure\
