Build one, set a direction, set a distance and step inside.\n\nCombat - think \"Salt\". It is cumbersome (and the cooldown timers aren't obvious) but it works.  My view is it is important mechanism but not the reason to play the game (note however, you cannot avoid combat for long).\n\nUnlike most \"crafting\" games - there comes a time when you wonder why you need to craft anything - the beauty of this game - is that as the Tiers increase - so you equipment needs to increase to match.  For instance, 5KM from center - do you really think you can chop a tree with that hatchet you made from T0 stone?\n\nIt has a boat (probably more than one)!\n\nLove the way warehouses expand and items marked as \"decorative\" aren't necessarily cosmetic.\n\nAs an EA game - this is one of the most rounded - with every system working to some extent and fairly clear which options are \"to be worked upon\" e.g. Careers and Trade (as of 1/1/2021).\n\nTime to eat some more cabbages and hunt.","timestamp_created":1609482483,"timestamp_updated":1609482483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ407ao3vYCcNqovwI="}
