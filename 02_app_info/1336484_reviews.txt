Mostly Purifier.\n\nSo this is an ending to a story arc where I explicitly have told you the first two arcs are a complete waste of your money and time. And worse still, the ending is abrupt and rather unsatisfying. Not even specifically sequel bait, just... it ends with four lines of \"Hooray we did it.\" and does not want to pay off on the setup like the Le Malin DLC did.\n\nI have to recommend it though as the story isn't bad unlike the first two, but it's also not something I can recommend you buy except if you actually did buy the first two and instead just want to get the whole set of DLCs.","timestamp_created":1605136991,"timestamp_updated":1605136991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549539864063262939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sdjn3PUCeJjrrQI="}
