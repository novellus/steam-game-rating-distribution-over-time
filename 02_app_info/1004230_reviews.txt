The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent developer Rafael García.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is the third entry of the series, and easily the best so far.  Having escaped the police station in Part 2, Johnny and his new pals (a punk chick, a washed-up detective, and a crackpot conspiracy theorist) go in search of a UFO that will take them to the aliens.  The group stops at a dusty old saloon in the middle of nowhere, and Johnny soon discovers the top-secret facility hiding beneath its foundations.  \n\nThis third entry in the series is really good.  Rafael García has fully hit his stride, and this entry is bigger and more complex than the previous two.  The government facility is well-designed and full of creative little touches; we are confined to a very small area at first, and gradually gain access to more and more of it through solving puzzles.  This is the first game in which Johnny needs to rely on the help of others to solve a number of the puzzles; each of the companions is able to assist in some way.\n\nThis is a solid game well worth picking up.\n","timestamp_created":1609637309,"timestamp_updated":1609637309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pIX34vYCc9j1vwI="}
