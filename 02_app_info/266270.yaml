    review: "Great game. \n\nIt is really a game of luck as the cards are either on\
      \ your side or they are against you and that could change a game especially\
      \ if you're fourth down, 8 yards from a first down and got no matches and you\
      \ have to choose the big play and hope luck is on your side.\n\nHere's a tip,\
      \ if the opposition are on third down and are getting nowhere near first down\
      \ in that play, it may be wise to end the play chances are they will punt on\
      \ fourth down unless they are close to a touchdown or is near the end of the\
      \ half or game.\n"
