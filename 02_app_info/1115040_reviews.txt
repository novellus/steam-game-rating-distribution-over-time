However the main problem (apart from appalling spelling!!) is its so buggy and prone to lock up or even suffer \"fatal errors\" at a moments notice, and in completely random places.\n\nSome much so it rapidly becomes unplayable, and with the best will in the world, one cannot stick with it. I think I showed remarkable patience to put up for it for the couple of hours (over a few sessions) that I did. I am uninstalling it.\n\n","timestamp_created":1601130819,"timestamp_updated":1601130819,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ426215fQCcbGapAI="}
