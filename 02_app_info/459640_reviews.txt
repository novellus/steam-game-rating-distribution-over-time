Aldorlea is one of them, having made quite\na few that have garnered some dedicated fans. Having fully completed this game,\nallow me to say that if you like the games that come from Aldorlea, or are interested\nin trying out one of them, you should steer far away from this game.\n\nAlthough this game is certainly nowhere near the standards of Triple A games or\neven some of the more professionally made independent games, it's nevertheless\nshocking to me that Aldorlea would release this game in the condition that it was in.\n\nWhen asked if the dev would make another game, the dev responded with a no, as\nthis game wasn't close to being successful (you'll find out why). However, what had\nbothered me was the developers response, and I quote :\n\n[i]...\"but I guess people prefer the usual RPG formula that most of the other games\nfollow\"....[/i]\n\nThis right here? This just screams of deflection. No doubt the dev had some very\nbig ideas for this game, but it clearly showed that this dev had little to no understanding\nabout how to go about doing so. Rather than taking more time to polish and fine tune\nthe product, said dev just decided to ship it out as is, which is very irresponsible. So\nwhen you see how bad a job they did, and look at the above response, you cannot help\nbut think to yourself, [u]\"the nerve\"[/u] to say something like that.\n\n=== The Bad ===\n\n1) The Interface\n\nYes, right off the bat, you'll very quickly find that the game's user interface and just\nnavigating the menu, and other locations to be just flat out awful. The hoops you\nhave to jump through for the clunky and obviously unoptimized menu is just asking\nway too much from you.\n\n2) Itemization\n\nSo [i]YOU and who else?[/i] fancies itself as a kind of strategy (?) RPG, and like\nin all RPGs, as you get stronger, you'll need better equipment as you level up.\nUnfortunately, the fact that the weapons and items are **limited**, means that\nthe player can't fully outfit their army to prepare for the battles ahead. Instead the\nplayer is forced to choose favorites, which limits the players freedom of choice.\n\nAlso, it makes keeping players decently geared extremely limited, which again,\nconsidering how ridiculously unoptimized the difficulty of this game is, even if you\njust focused on 1 General, they can't carry the entire game alone. Essentially you\nneed items, desperately so, to advance, and the game just doesn't give it to you.\nNormally you would imagine this was a creative decision to emphasize difficulty\nor even strategy but I assure you, you'll very quickly find out that this is just yet\nanother example of bad development.\n\nWhich leads me to the next big issue : income being virtually nonexistent. Fire\nEmblem, a series not generally known for grinding (at least in the old days),\nhad at least some areas where players could grind some iota of currency to help\nbolster their forces. And grinding in general, is as much a staple for RPGs as it\ncomes.\n\nInstead, there seems to be only two ways to gain currency : taking over locations\n(the 1st time only), and if you have an item equipped that gives a pathetic 6 GP\nafter every fight. Considering how the further you go, the more expensive things\nget, this is almost akin to the very poor and ultra grindy RPG designs from the\n80's and even early 90's. Once again, this isn't a choice to challenge the player,\nthis is an example of bad development making a decision that ultimately [u]makes\nthe player waste their time[/u].\n\n4) Bad Combat\n\nBy far the strangest (and worst) design of [i]YOU and who else?[/i] is the combat.\nThe structure of battles is done by having one of your generals and their small\nparty of unique to them NPCs fighting wave after wave of pre-set enemies in turn\nbased combat until you clear them.\n\nNow the game clearly doesn't support this system well, and to make matters worse,\nthe design aspects of this are beyond needlessly frustrating. If at any point in time\none of your generals is defeated, rather than give the player the option to switch to\nanother one (which would make sense considering how you are a party), instead,\nthe battle simply ends. Which makes one wonder why you're even in a party to begin\nwith.\n\n5) Unbalanced Difficulty\n\nBecause of the mountain of problems caused by it's unbalanced gameplay, my god\ndoes this mess of a game become unbearingly difficult. So as I stated earlier, the\nnonexistent income and poor itemization certainly contribute to the difficulty, but in\ntruth the real issue is how EXP is distributed.\n\nExperience points are laughably low, so low in fact that you'll be grinding for hours\njust to make any headway. And to top it off, you don't get EXP for clearing each\nwave, you [u]ONLY[/u] get it after clearing the entire wave entirely. As you can\nimagine, you won't be having the slightest ounce of fun while this is happening.\n\n\n6) Terrible Story\n\nAnd the coup de grace of this game is easily it's forgettable (even as you're playing)\nstory. Of what little there is shown, it embarrassingly appears as though this was the\ndev's first time at learning how to write a story. The introduction feels lazy (so the\nprotagonist has a boy/girlfriend, who contributes....nothing to the story. Why even\nmention them to begin with?), there is no tension or sense of urgency in the plot,\nno proper sense of build up or if there are even any stakes, and literally ZERO\nworld building despite the multitude of different locations, races, characters, etc.\n\n\nSo if you're asking, \"is this one of the bad RPG Maker games?\", the answer is\nwith an outstanding yes, this is one of those.","timestamp_created":1571405483,"timestamp_updated":1609403600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551139354705810547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyMH72/YCdoOn1AE="}
