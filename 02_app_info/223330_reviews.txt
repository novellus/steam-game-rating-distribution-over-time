So, I do recommend it but only if all that stuff is fixed. However the game itself is just amazing, story and the entire gameplay, it's easy but complicated all the time just the way i like it. I played it on impossible even, but there are things that start to annoy you once you get into it.\nFor example game can crash once you board another ship but you do have an option for auto-save once you board so that's fine, then another thing is that if two NPC ships board one another there is a high chance for both of them to just sink and no one wins which sucks in case that one of them is a ship from your squadron. And one more thing that really bothered me is that playing it in full screen is somewhat impossible on windows 10, if you enter the command for it on steam you might start it that way or you won't at all, if you do start it then pressing windows button will just crash the game and if it doesn't start then you can only play it with twice smaller game screen which is just stupid since the game is extremely fun.","timestamp_created":1584330205,"timestamp_updated":1609974607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556771993637084961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yd397PYCd++3+AE="}
