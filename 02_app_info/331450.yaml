    about_the_game: "Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo features two main storylines. As\
      \ in the 2003 animated feature film, the clown fish Nemo is headed for his first\
      \ day at school when he's captured near Australia's Great Barrier Reef by a\
      \ scuba diver and winds up in an aquarium in a dentist's office. In the first\
      \ storyline, players take the role of Nemo's father, Marlin, who with the assistance\
      \ of a forgetful Regal Blue Tang fish named Dory, must solve puzzles and master\
      \ arcade-style mini-games in their search for his missing son. The second storyline\
      \ involves Nemo's attempts to become friends with the other inhabitants of the\
      \ aquarium in order to join the Tank Gang and help pull off their secret escape\
      \ plan. Players can switch between the two storylines at anytime during the\
      \ adventure until the two are united.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the adventure,\
      \ players are introduced to characters from the film who help Marlin and Nemo\
      \ accomplish tasks. During Marlin's story, players must escape from Bruce the\
      \ Shark, recover the diver's mask from a sunken submarine, avoid an anglerfish,\
      \ hop across a maze of jellyfish, and hitch a ride on the current to Sydney\
      \ Harbor. Meanwhile, mini-games and puzzles in Nemo's segment include using\
      \ pebbles to jam the aquarium's filter, catching bubbles before they reach the\
      \ top of the tank, maneuvering through a maze of Tiki heads, helping Jacques\
      \ get his key chain unstuck, and escaping from a crab-infested sewer pipe. Once\
      \ father and son are reunited, they must save Dory and other fish from a fisherman's\
      \ net."
