    review: 'In this episode, you control Lila and Empel. You are in a new region
      that you don''t see in the main story.


      Lots of things to do. You can gather many materials and you have many recipes,
      but you cannot make anything you want because you lack some important materials.
      You have to figure out how to optimize your equipment.


      The starting gear is not strong enough and you have to kill a checkpoint monster
      and a boss at the end which are pretty strong.


      This is a pretty good DLC. The story is good, you have to think to make the
      best gear possible, the battles are challenging and you get to explore an unknown
      region.


      I recommend doing this DLC after you finish the game.'
