The batle against the cult and demon was weird, I could have lost the sword if I missed a few more skulls. Also, not having a map in the dungeon was terrible, since everything was dark and similar. Selling / buying itens is terrible right now, it's so easy to sell an item buy accident...\n\nFor some reason the steam did not recorded my playtime in the lap top, so I had to reinstall just for the review (but my 2 achievements are there...)\n\nStill, I can recommend this, trying to introduce a \"souls like\"battle system in a zelda-like game was nice.","timestamp_created":1550281236,"timestamp_updated":1550281236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4sv9+egCdLP/ugE="}
