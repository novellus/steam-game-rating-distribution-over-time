I personally hate that funky astronaut that is as big as satelites or saucers, but I can tolerate It as it doesn't harm the gameplay. Unfortunately the developer forgot to work on the most basic and important parts of an arcade game.\n\nFirst is controls. The controls are not configurable, and The only keyboard controls I can use is A and D to rotate and W to thrust and Shift to fire. Since I perfer the original asteroids control scheme I don't like the thrust key being placed with the rotating keys.\n\nUsing controllers is worse. The developers screwed up the analog input. The analog never reponds correctly that aiming or moving precisely with it is literally impossible, and there's no traditional clockwise/counterclockwise rotating keys for the controllers.\nButton A for fire isn't a great option too, You are suppossed to mash the fire button like crazy but Xbox360-style gamepad's ABXY buttons are the worst for that job. I'll set it as left trigger if i were the developers.\n\nThe controls are very basic but also very important things in Arcade action games, so this is a huge problem.\n\nSecond issue is the lack of leaderboard. What's the point of not having the leaderboard in a game about getting the highest scores ? It doesn't even save my personal highest record. Even the 1979 arcade game had it.\n\nDespite being sold as a finished project, Space Junk feels like an early access or rushed project.\n\nUsually, I refund the games immediately when there's an issue that ruins playing the game. However, I decided to keep this game because The developers are claiming that they will keep working on this game till next year, and despite the control issues and lack of leaderboard, The game actually offers very solid and satisfying arcade action.\n\nThe developers should keep their promises and actually improve this otherwise good vector arcade game. If they have managed to do it I'll change my review to recommended.","timestamp_created":1595845029,"timestamp_updated":1595845079,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/e3xx/MCeqLolwI="}
