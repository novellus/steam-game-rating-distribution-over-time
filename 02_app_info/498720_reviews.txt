Cute game with some really down to earth art. Very similar to lemmings game. I hate giving a no review for small indie games but unfortunately for the asking price of $10 it's not worth it. If the game on sale for a buck support an indie studio but this won't burn hours away.","timestamp_created":1599561766,"timestamp_updated":1599561766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx/LTtvQCe4DGoAI="}
