      creepily tense breathing, and haunting music. Maybe you'll contemplate dedication,

    short_description: Feel the inhuman tension of outer space - floating between
      bits of debris - struggling to conserve air and fuel - experiencing a hauntingly
      personal tragedy.

    review: "Here's thoughts of my first 15 minutes in the VOID:\n\nTried training\
      \ mode first but it froze so I restarted the game. Tried again, same result,\
      \ same solution.\nI then tried the main scenario. It's either it lags and/or\
      \ the wonky controls and/or ''motion blurr'', but the orientation/control is,\
      \ quite awful.  Athough really cool atmosphere, I wish I could enjoy it more..\
      \ By reducing the ''Fantastic'' settings to ''Bearable'' somehow, but there's\
      \ no option menu, neither when you boot up the game nor in the main menu. (EDIT:\
      \ I find that when you lower your resolution, it may help a bit, if you experience\
      \ the same thing I explained).\nSo I tried again the main scenario, I took my\
      \ time so I could get the hang ot it and now it's okay-ish, but I wish it could\
      \ have atleast lower settings IF the controls were intended to be tedious.\n\
      It was still tedious, so I went back and tried training mode, again. It froze\
      \ so I waited it out until it warmed up (cough...) it'll work, it'll work I\
      \ said....... and it worked! Only to find a terrible choice of music: Upbeat\
      \ dubstep or whatever it is while listening to someone lacking oxygen.... So\
      \ I endured both, and the tutorial was fine afterall.\nThen I tried Random scenario\
      \ and then, only then, the game became good, myabe: You are presented some sort\
      \ of objective and there the music fits\n\nLonging thought while playing:\n\
      I'm sure I'd be better off playing Capsule...\n\nBut, \nI won't, because gameplay-wise,\
      \ with its theme and its music, Void is a win but the lack of options, especially\
      \ visual/graphic settings and that intense ''motion blurr'' lost a chunk of\
      \ my interest.\nWhile it has its flaws, It does offer its players a tense experience\
      \ of struggle with little to no control, in space."
