      waves of aliens while upgrading gear! Tear through progressively harder hordes
      of aliens, get better guns and armor or build your way to victory. Can you balance

      Getting hurt too much? Buy some armor. Want a more passive approach? Turrets,

    review: 'Super fun and a lot of content for one developer! The formula is simple:
      kill wave after wave of enemies and buy sick weapons that will help you kill
      even more. There''s also a ton of features and depth of interactions in the
      map, although there is only one. If you''re looking for a casual yet engaging
      game to pick up, this is the one'
