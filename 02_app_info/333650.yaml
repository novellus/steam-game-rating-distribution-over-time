    review: 'I left the game at the second house where the girl opens the door and
      when I came back the game did not let me leave the house. The door was opening
      and closing at a fast pace and there was no way to leave the house.


      Also some of the puzzles are insanely hard especially the one with  the 12 pictures
      you should match to a story that opens the door to the cupboard with the pounch
      and sand inside it.


      can''t recommend this game due to the game breaking bug and that some of the
      puzzles are to hard.'
