I then installed and did the same thing and, wow, it's much, much improved. Very detailed and realistic. It doesn't seem to impact framerates either which is a big bonus. Looking forward to seeing more of this in the future - recommended purchase.","timestamp_created":1522099805,"timestamp_updated":1522099805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tPuNsuICd7DWnAE="}
