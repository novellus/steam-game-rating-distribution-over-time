      \ jogarem (nem que seja s\xF3 para se rirem)!\n\nENG: A great f****** sequel!!\n\
      Just like the 1st game, it has more sillyness, a few more cooky side-quests\
      \ and this time also features a beautiful pixelized bottle of Licor Beir\xE3\
      o!!! A real true Tuga style game (that made me decide to never take the Inter-Cidades\
      \ Porto-Lisbon ever again) that I recommend playing (even if just for a laugh)!\n\
      \nA quick note to people playing this game in english, though: If you play (and\
      \ understand) in Portuguese, the game becomes 200% funnier"
