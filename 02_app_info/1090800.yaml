      \ /><br><br>You play the role of a forest ranger who was sent on a rescue mission\
      \ and ended up trapped on an island whose climate has suffered mysterious and\
      \ drastic changes. Massive blizzards, freezing temperatures and hungry predators\
      \ are some of the dangers that threaten your survival.<br><br>This is the core\
      \ experience of Northern Lights. In less than a second, you find yourself helpless\
      \ in front of the unforgiving Siberian wilderness. From being the hunter, you\
      \ became the hunted. Stranded far from any human habitation, you have to endure\
      \ the harsh arctic conditions, hunt for supplies, investigate the mystery and\
      \ find a way to escape the island. There is no manual to show you how to survive.\
      \ Your success depends on getting out there and using all your abilities to\
      \ master necessary wilderness survival skills.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1090800/extras/store_inline_separator.png?t=1610009302\"\

      notes: Northern Lights may contain content that is not appropriate for all ages.
        The depiction of violence is at a stage that looks similar to what would be
        expected in real life. The game may contain bad language, use of tobacco,
        use of alcohol and graphical violence towards animals (e.g. hunting and killing
        wild animals for survival. The wounded animals and the carcasses may show
        blood).
