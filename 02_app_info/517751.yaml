    about_the_game: "Checkmate ends the game \u2013 that's an undeniable fact. Yet\
      \ sometimes players who gleefully and unashamedly play for the attack are treated\
      \ as a joke by their colleagues. Launching a successful attack is a skillful\
      \ business that often demands great creativity. And like most themes in chess,\
      \ this is a skill that can be honed and polished. In the second edition of the\
      \ Power Play series, Grandmaster Daniel King looks at attacking play and asks\
      \ what makes for a successful attack. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTest your attacking\
      \ and defensive skills by examining a series of specially selected test positions.\
      \ The Power Play series is suitable for anyone looking to improve their chess,\
      \ and provides ready-made lessons and exercises for a trainer.  <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nGrandmaster Daniel King has been a professional chess player for more\
      \ than 20 years. During that time he has represented his country on many occasions,\
      \ including an historic match victory over the Soviet Union in Reykjavik, 1990.\
      \ At the same time he has distinguished himself as a coach, helping many of\
      \ England\u2018s younger generation to achieve their potential. Besides his\
      \ chess career, he has built up a reputation as a commentator on television,\
      \ radio and the internet. He is also an award-winning author of more than 15\
      \ books."
