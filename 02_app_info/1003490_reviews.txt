Accurate enough so far.\n\n\"• do cat-like things\"\nYou can move around. You can meow, sleep, and sit. Seems pretty cat-like.\n\n\"• 40+ hours of gameplay\"\nTechnically, there's an infinite amount of gameplay, as the game has no ending that I can discern. You look at the pictures and listen to the music for as long as you'd like, and then you quit. If you defined the end of gameplay as having seen all the pictures, though, then that'd be 40 hours of slowly walking with an average of 24 minutes and 45 seconds per image.\n\n\"• suffer alone or together as a great party game\"\nPlay this game at a party and watch as your true friends distinguish themselves from mere acquaintances.\n\n\"• only enjoyable while delirious\"\nI mean, I enjoyed it, and I wasn't delirious in the slightest. Then again, I also picked apart the game files and edited the game so that my walking speed was a much more reasonable pace, so your mileage may vary.\n\n\"• non-referential content\"\nPretty accurate.\n\n\"• extremely limited features and gameplay\"\nEven more accurate.\n\n\"• exasperatingly challenging, impossible to speedrun\"\nIt may be exasperating, but I don't know if it's challenging. It's like calling an art museum challenging. It is impossible to speedrun, as there is no ending.\n\nApart from the last point, it seems I got exactly what was described, so I'm gonna give this game a thumbs up. If you buy this game, I'd recommend editing the files to increase your speed, going through it once to enjoy the small amount of interactivity it offers, then decrypting the image and sound files to enjoy separately. There is over an hour of music included, after all, and a lot of it sounds pretty boppin'.\n\nEdit: I'm making this edit to correct a point. This game does have an ending, and can therefor be speedrun. I am patiently awaiting the first speedrun of this game.","timestamp_created":1549079476,"timestamp_updated":1608774042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":71,"votes_funny":16,"weighted_vote_score":"0.887977480888366699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmfiZyfYCderkuQE="}
