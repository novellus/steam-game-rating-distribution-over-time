It’s so simple you just avoid the bombs being dropped from above and make it to the bottom. It gets pretty challenging the farther you go down but the reward is worth it. Like I was able to unlock higher jumps so instead of 2 block jump height I was able to go 3. It makes it easier but it still gets difficult the farther down you go in apocalypse. There are plenty of unlockables and I’m sure many more to come in this game so it makes the  $2 worth it. This is an extremely addictive game and I can't wait to see what the dev adds in the future.","timestamp_created":1603748969,"timestamp_updated":1603748969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oue4s/UCe6mqqgI="}
