    review: "A subversive masterpiece.\n\nLook, no spoilers, but this is a game where\
      \ you take the role of a Vatican detective sent to a monastery to secretly investigate\
      \ the mystery of a statue that weeps blood and a monk who recently vanished,\
      \ and within minutes you open a trap door at the foot of the statue--which is\
      \ not even hidden--and inside there is the ghost of the missing monk, just chilling\
      \ out, and he tells you immediately who done it.  The entire game is like this\
      \ and it's played completely straight. \n\nIf that setup doesn't give you a\
      \ chuckle, this is not the casual puzzle adventure game you're looking for.\n\
      \nThe bulk of the gameplay consists of playing look n' find in the background\
      \ art as you do literal chores for the monks and villagers.  Eventually by doing\
      \ this you arrive at puzzles which range from bad to moderately challenging.\
      \  Myst it ain't, but the simplicity of the puzzles rhymes with the absurdity\
      \ of the plot.\n\nI paid $1 for this on sale, but I'd have paid full price if\
      \ I knew I was striking comedy gold."
