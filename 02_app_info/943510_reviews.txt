It misses perfection as the text, whilst large, is not read aloud. Had to use a magnifier to read clearly.\nGameplay is easy to grasp.\nYou have to get to the exit, enemies don't want you to get there. Sneak past them, or kill them. Nouise is your enemy, noise is your friend.\nEnjoy.","timestamp_created":1577656831,"timestamp_updated":1577656831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wZnrqe8CcdSY6AE="}
