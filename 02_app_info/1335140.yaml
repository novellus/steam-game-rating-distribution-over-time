    review: "First of all this is over-priced. The box set retailed at 3990 Yen, roughly\
      \ 37 USD, when it came out in 2012. But, if you are trying to find a new copy\
      \ of it today, it will be around this price or a bit more; 60-70 USD from 3rd\
      \ party sellers. The box is broken into three parts on Steam for around 19 USD\
      \ each. The songs, are in MP3, AAC, and FLAC format audio. \n\nWith that minor\
      \ annoyance out of the way, the soundtracks of the first three games are very\
      \ good. Dare I say my favorite OSTs of all time. If you missed the chance to\
      \ get the actual CDs or like digital better, this is it here. The most complete\
      \ collection of the first three Ace Attorney games' soundtracks. Not a single\
      \ song is left out, you'll find it all here. Every variation, every ringtone.\
      \ \n\nI am very pleased to see this on Steam, despite its price. Now please\
      \ excuse me while I go change my pants after listening to the album in FLAC.\
      \ \n"
