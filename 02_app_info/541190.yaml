    about_the_game: "Modern MMOs are missing something. Somewhere along the way, game\
      \ developers realized that appealing to the masses meant forsaking the heart\
      \ and soul of classic RPGs - intricate character development - and focusing\
      \ instead on graphics and simplicity of gameplay. Nodiatis is the antithesis\
      \ to this modern paradigm. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA classical RPG in an MMO setting,\
      \ Nodiatis appeals to gamers who appreciate retro gaming but still want the\
      \ excitement of competitive play. While it has a story line, quests, and ...graphics,\
      \ the true appeal is in the complex and strategic means of advancing your character(s).\
      \ To start, there are over 26 classes from which to choose, each with its own\
      \ unique active ability and passive bonuses. From there you must increase in\
      \ strength mainly by carefully divvying your accumulated experiencing (in the\
      \ form of trophies hacked from your foes) into any of the over 200 skills. Only\
      \ with intelligent choices can you hope to become a powerful force. There are\
      \ no pre-ordained paths or skill trees to guide the uninspired. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nIn addition to the solo and cooperative PvE progression that you would\
      \ expect from an RPG, Nodiatis offers some very unique PvP. Very few have the\
      \ stomach for our most controversial PvP - becoming a permanent player killer,\
      \ allowing you to kill and steal items from anyone, but dying forever if you\
      \ are eventually hunted down and killed yourself. For the others there is clan\
      \ based world PvP and set duration arena tournaments, both allowing you to gain\
      \ status and help your clan to unlock powerful runes that can help all members.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNodiatis is already available for play via browser, however,\
      \ we are porting to a new engine which will allow for vastly superior performance\
      \ and a completely revamped interface."
