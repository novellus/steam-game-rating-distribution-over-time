Easy to say; I was wrong. For about fifteen hours I did my best to love this game, did ever rout and explored every possible outcome and I am sad to say….. I liked it in paces, which makes it worse. The Felix, clone and evil queen routs were enjoyable enough but not only was Novas rout 60% virtue signalling, most of the game is afraid to be truly, well, evil. Before someone notes in their mind though, I have about 65% the same views and opinions as the game so it is not what message it speaks of just how and in what type of property. Nova, I am here to date you not to hear your views of the American health care system. I am not even American, I don’t care. All the character except, maybe, the queen are way too careful to preserve your and other peoples feeling. No actual bad language or controversial things are said, which, is weird as you would consider villains to say something that wouldn’t make you just go: “hah, he thinks he is cool lul”. \n\nThis “we accept all” message the game tries to print on all its characters foreheads is frustrating as it has 0 subtility. The one most guilty of this is Satan, so much of his dialogue is just discussing pointless details about belief systems that and how everyone in them is valid. Like, why? Your Satan and why would our evil character ask all those questions? Why is Satan, during this villain conference defending his and other people’s goodness and explaining that hell is indeed not homophobic? All of us are bad guys, were going down anyways, for what reason I don’t care. I am still a guy and I will still take those pants off Lucy. There are other issues too though: the jokes are repetitive; the plot is predictable (except maybe the clone one though I figured it out quickly) and the dialogue is often stiff and awkward. Your choices matter little too, except one choice in Felix rout, two in the queens, one in Lucifers and non in Novas your choice matter nothing. Also why do all of Felix ending use the same art? Not to mention the non-skippable mini game instructions are quite annoying.\n\nI don’t want to go out on the negative though. I enjoyed the mini games and the despite the clone story being basic the addition of his master and their motivations was adorable, and I approve. The art, though uncanny on some characters, is also well made and the colour choices are nice. Overall, if I didn’t want this game to be more morally grey (being about villains, this felt like a children’s show in the aspect of how villains behave) witch just the normal interactions and such I would give it 5/10 and with that a 3.5/10. Also, I am very disappointed I could introduce the mad scientist to my gay charms. My girlfriend was also disappointed Felix sister was non-dateble. The game has its charm it just isn’t what I enjoy so if you adore it more then your mother/father shout it from the rooftops and I wouldn’t mind.","timestamp_created":1609717595,"timestamp_updated":1609717595,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6ep5fYCcv+dwAI="}
