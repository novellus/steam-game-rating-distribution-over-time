    about_the_game: A hardcore minimalistic puzzle game where you need to get all
      the hexagons on a luminous platform. But each hexagon has its own trajectory,
      so it will not be so simple. If you want to get distracted for a couple of hours
      and solve interesting problems with understandable mechanics, then you will
      like it. In the game you will find many levels with increasing difficulty, but
      you are not limited by time, the number of attempts, you can decide as much
      as you like, restart the level again. Have a nice game.

    review: It is a simple, yet addictive puzzle game. I like the graphic. Sometimes
      can get a bit challenging. It is very rewarding once you have put all the pieces
      in the highlighted space. Nice work, love it.
