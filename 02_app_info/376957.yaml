    review: 10 good scenarios. Only little problem I ran into was the GP20 not responding
      to the usual keybinds to control the dynamic brake. Had to use the F4 interface
      and mouse to control the dynamic brake. I suspect it's a bug in the GP20, but
      I guess it would've been better for the scenario pack creator not to include
      a scenario with the GP20 going downhill.
