Instead of a long linear system of similar sub-levels to beat sequentially (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, etc.), each level (mall) contains fewer sub-levels (stores) that need to be unlocked and repeated at the player's discretion to earn advancement points. This could easily be repetitive with an average time-management game with little item diversity, but this game has many dozens of distinct items and even requires the player combine items to make new ones. Kudos to their item artists for not being lazy!\n\nAs time-management games go, Shop-n-Spree is on the easier side because the customers are very patient. It's a excellent entry-level game into the genre, but skilled players will probably crush it. The mini-games are infinitely repeatable to build up a \"magic box\" buff that can be used in any store, again being very kind to the player.\n\nOne negative - there are restocking cards with pictures of the items next to the actual items. When gathering combos, it is too easy to accidentally pick up the picture of the item, rather than the item, especially if the items are blue like the cards. If the restock cards could only have been right-clicked, it would have been less annoying.\n\nOne moment of gameplay struck me as particularly funny - at the America mall, a customer asked to put a gift bow on a 2-liter bottle of soda.","timestamp_created":1535757469,"timestamp_updated":1535757469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41OiRyeUCcJTfqQE="}
