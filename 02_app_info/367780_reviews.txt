If it were a free download, I'd suggest it with the caveat to not get too involved or attached, as there's a good chance you won't be able to finish the game or achievements.  It's always sad to see a game abandoned by its creators, and this one is no exception.","timestamp_created":1526436039,"timestamp_updated":1526436039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509070873260498047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lbGrs+MCfoS5oAE="}
