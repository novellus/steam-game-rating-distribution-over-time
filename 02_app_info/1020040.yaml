    review: 'By itself, the DLC is mostly novel, but if mixed with base assets, it
      can actually be pretty nice. Mixing it with the standard Outside tiles, I was
      able to make a pretty versatile tileset that made a believable arctic city,
      which I''m happy with. 11.99 seems a bit much for something that otherwise doesn''t
      have much use and is mostly for Christmasy stuff, but overall I''m happy with
      my purchase.


      Like most RMMV DLC (and ACE for that matter), only buy if you need it, it''s
      totally skippable if you don''t need winter or snowy tiles that are better than
      the base game.'
