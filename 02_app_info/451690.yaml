    review: 'I have tried to learn how to play chess for many years, and while there
      were some games which may have been a bit more instructional, being able to
      select the level of play is a great feature.  Add to it symphonic music that
      is both soothing and easy on the ears, and you''ve got a great experience to
      learn and play chess.  You can decide to play the computer or go online and
      find someone to play against.  If you find someone online that''s really good,
      you can ask questions, and they will usually try to help you learn better moves
      and counter moves.  I love that part of the game''s community.


      Play is definitely spotty on Linux, so I don''t play it when I''m logged into
      my Linux system but it''s perfect on Windows.'
