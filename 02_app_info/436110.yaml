    review: Short atmospheric horror game in Greek mythology which is a bonus point.
      I did pay for the DLC to support them though I cannot recommend a payment for
      the game in its current state. It has a severe bug (e.g. bow won't reappear
      if you cancel during draw); crippled fighting (the bow will just go off when
      the monster is close) and above all the clunky- and slow movement speed. Still
      these guys are on the right track if they fix that and add more content to it.
