A lot of the time I start accelerating in a direction when I stop holding the direction, other times the bounce pad should bounce me, it animates that it is, but it just doesn't bounce the character. The bounce pads even give me a very high amount of horizontal momentum, much more than you can get by mashing through the \"signs\" or whatever they are called. \nThe wall bounce pads also do not make much sense, how do I gain height by getting bounced sideways?\nFinally, most of the monster attack for too quick so you are unable to dodge, this wouldn't be a problem if you can predict when they attack, many times i think an enemy is going to attack, but instead it just stands there. Enemies are far to easy to just run past.\nGood idea, nice visuals, lacks polish on movement.","timestamp_created":1609976187,"timestamp_updated":1609976187,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h+GD7fYCff2RwQI="}
