    about_the_game: "One of the most short-lived electric locomotives for the Northeast\
      \ Corridor \u2013 the Amtrak HHP-8 comes to Train Simulator for the stunning\
      \ new NEC: New York-New Haven route.<br><br>The 8,000hp, twin-cab electric HHP-8\
      \ (\u2018High Horse Power 8000\u2019) was manufactured by a consortium of Bombardier\
      \ Transportation and Alstom for use by Amtrak and the Maryland Area Regional\
      \ Commuter (MARC) system. Ordered in 1999, 15 locomotives were produced for\
      \ Amtrak and six for MARC.<br><br>Similar in external style to the Acela, the\
      \ HHP-8 was designed to operate as a true locomotive to haul conventional passenger\
      \ cars, as a replacement for Amtrak\u2019s GE E60s and supplement the ageing\
      \ EMD AEM-7s. Ironically, their lack of reliability and high maintenance costs\
      \ meant the fleet was phased out just 10 years later, being replaced by the\
      \ more modern and efficient ACS-64.<br><br>The locomotive is capable of running\
      \ on three different power supplies seen on the Northeast Corridor from dual\
      \ pantographs, picking up power from 12.5Kv 25 Hz AC catenary, 12.5Kv 60Hz AC\
      \ catenary and 25 kV 60Hz AC catenary. It also has a top design speed of 135mph\
      \ (217 km/h) but is actually limited in service to FRA Tier 1 standards, operating\
      \ up to 125mph (201 km/h).<br><br>The HHP-8 for Train Simulator is available\
      \ in Amtrak\u2019s renowned blue and silver livery, and features cruise control,\
      \ in-cab signalling display with driver vigilance, switchable display screens,\
      \ cab lights, flashing ditch lights and pantograph select. Also included are\
      \ Amfleet I passenger cars.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible,\
      \ giving you the freedom to drive the Amtrak HHP-8 on any Quick Drive enabled\
      \ route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included\
