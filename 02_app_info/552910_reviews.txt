I've played a number of idle games in my time, and honestly, most of them have more to actively do at any given moment than this one. There is really only one bar to watch tick up, your money bar, and once you've spent the money on a tattoo or command, there isn't much to do but wait for it to tick high enough again other than click on a couple of icons that very occasionally appear, or play an inconsequential dice gambling minigame. Sure, the artwork and music are decent, and I'm willing to bet that most people who enjoy it do so for its aesthetics, but even the ecchi element of the game is far oversold in the promotional materials compared to what is actually in the game. (Not that I'm complaining--I'm not really into that kind of thing, though I'll tolerate it for the sake of good gameplay, story, or humor.)\n\nAll of that said, I did play on Normal mode, and I have read in other reviews that the harder game modes do require more strategic thinking to beat the game with a good rating. But honestly, I find that a bit hard to believe, because short of the ability to tell your character which ward to invade next, you have no direct control at all over almost anything on the main map. Invasions happen automatically, and telling your character which ward to invade is only going to prompt them to invade that ward earlier than they otherwise might've done. When you consider that wards are not invaded sequentially--you're constantly expanding and invading wards even before you've conquered a single one--the ability to add another ward to that list doesn't make much of a difference at all. And it's not like one ward will give you special bonuses over another--the bonuses for conquering each and every ward is exactly the same: a bit of money and honor, and it turns blue on the map. That's literally it. The only thing I could think that might become more difficult or complex on the harder difficulties is managing the money you do have coming in between tattoos geared towards the specializations of the wards you're currently invading, and commands to help preserve your honor bar as long as possible. Even if that is the case, however, there are free-to-play idle games on Steam or even your phone that involve considerably more strategic planning in that respect, many of them with comparable artwork and music, albeit maybe with fewer boobs.\n\nI guess in a word, I'd say this game is fine. There are unlockable commands and items for each difficulty in each route, so you'll have new things to play with in each playthrough, especially if you're going for the ridiculous achievements that require you to play each route 8 times. So you [i]can[/i] get your money's worth if you buy the game on sale and happen to enjoy it. As for myself, I'll probably go back to it for a quick playthrough every now and again when I feel like playing something mindless, but it's not a game I can recommend to others to buy, especially at full price, for most people.","timestamp_created":1609535041,"timestamp_updated":1609535041,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43vXw3/YCdOjBvwI="}
