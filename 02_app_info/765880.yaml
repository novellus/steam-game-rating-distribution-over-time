    review: "This game is a seriously impressive immersive sim that I would highly\
      \ recommend to anyone interested in stealth games, rpgs or imsims despite its\
      \ flaws. \n\nYou play as a journalist who has been assigned to interview several\
      \ employees of the company behind a controversial new law about to be passed\
      \ in England in 1987. The twist is that you have exactly one hour in real-time\
      \ to explore the building and gather information before your interview, while\
      \ avoiding the watchful eyes of the security guards and pencil-pushers. The\
      \ main mechanics of this game have all the stealth/imsim staples; collecting\
      \ tapes and door codes, alternate routes through vents, guards who say things\
      \ like \"I know i heard something...\", albeit in a more compact space. The\
      \ Occupation adds one crucial twist, however. Once you run out of time in a\
      \ chapter, you're done and have to progress the story. You've got a schedule\
      \ to keep after all, so you have to work fast. You can't save mid-chapter either,\
      \ so save-scumming to try and get a perfect run through isn't possible. \n\n\
      The real-time mechanic combined with the lack of saves that elevates this game\
      \ beyond what would be a well-made but otherwise brief immersive sim. As someone\
      \ who's used to reloading stealth games upon being seen or reloading a conversation\
      \ to get the optimal dialogue options, being forced into work quickly and live\
      \ with my mistakes was actually quite thrilling. An hour feels like a lot of\
      \ time, but ultimately when it came down to the wire I'd panic and have to choose\
      \ which of my leads to chase down within the limited time frame. The fact that\
      \ the game forces you to commit to how you spend your precious hour makes it\
      \ feel much more like an experience than a game to be \"solved\". The rigid\
      \ rules and commitments required of this system may not be for everyone but\
      \ those who chose to engage with this game on its own terms will be rewarded\
      \ greatly.\n\nIt's not without its problems, of course. Occupation falls into\
      \ the stealth game trap of \"Let the player get into areas using vents\" in\
      \ a way that is egregious even for the genre and at times feels like it makes\
      \ exploration trivial. Systems and concepts are introduced and then never expanded\
      \ upon. Object interaction feels obtuse at times, having you use a combination\
      \ of button presses and mouse holds to open doors or containers. Its a bit rough\
      \ around the edges but I think this is a case of ambition pressing up against\
      \ budget more than anything else, and White Paper is certainly punching above\
      \ its weight class.\n\nI'm writing this after one full completion of the game,\
      \ and I'm excited to go for a second completion. The game also provides you\
      \ with a chapter select after you beat it, so you can explore specific chapters\
      \ again and root out all the secrets. Unfortunately I think a buggy release\
      \ prevented this game from getting the appreciation it deserved at launch, but\
      \ hopefully imsim fans and people looking for a unique experience will give\
      \ it a shot."
