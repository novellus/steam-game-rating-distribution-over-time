    review: 'A battle royale in many ways similar to pubg in its very early stages,
      with more pve elements such as monsters, zombies, dynamic weather and radiation
      to keep game-play interesting. Reminds me a bit of Stalker which I love. Has
      shown itself to be a promising addition to the BR genre.


      EDIT:  The dev has been improving their game and releasing patches addressing
      bugs. I have also been able to play multiplayer matches by joining servers directly.'
