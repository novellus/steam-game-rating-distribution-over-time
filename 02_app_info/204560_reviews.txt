The party can be modified on checkpoints. The game becomes increasingly difficult towards the end. Simply right clicking on a group of enemies can work on initial levels, but the same tactic can easily get your party killed later. \n\nI enjoyed the game, though I was not expecting much. Always have a tank in your party, and try to get rid of the enemy spellcasters first.","timestamp_created":1606590325,"timestamp_updated":1606590325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kNyPiPYCcdnXtAI="}
